1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,720
Rated Y, Sonic Event 38, and here we go.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,320
I asked just before we started to record about, in the chat room, I said, hey, anybody got

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,440
any last minute suggestions?

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,300
Somebody dropped a word in there, and I'll be honest, when I see it, I don't know what

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,000
that word means, but the Greeks saw it, and he does.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,960
Meanwhile, I don't know where else we're going to go.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,140
We'll see, and we never do know, because there is no script.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,040
Anyway, how are you doing tonight, Greg?

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,620
Doing all right.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah, I think I asked you, do you know what that means, by the way?

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's start the recording.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,360
You know, I'm one of the few people that does this kind of thing, that admits that, you know,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
almost everybody I see, they go, oh, I know what that means.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,760
They never do.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,420
Yeah, or they know after you tell them, of course.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,120
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,260
I get that all the time.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,340
I don't do that.

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,460
If I don't know, I don't know.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,360
And I don't know what that is.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,340
How do you pronounce that word?

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,580
Well, Bereshit.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,580
It's not English.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,860
It would go, it's part of Sefer Bereshit.

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,240
It would go like Bereshit bara Elohim et ha'shamayim v'heta'aretz.

27
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,160
Ah, OK.

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,660
OK, well, now I know the context, where it comes from, but OK.

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,780
It's Hebrew for beginnings.

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,760
So you would say Sefer Bereshit, which would be the scroll or the book, and then Bereshit

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:38,140
bara beginnings created Elohim, the gods, et ha'shamayim, et ha'shamayim, et ha'aretz,

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,280
the heavens and the earth.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:40,820
Right.

34
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,160
So that's in Hebrew.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,040
Should I keep going?

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,840
No, you want to go through Genesis, go right ahead.

37
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,300
But yeah, that's that's what he wanted to know, the beginning.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,580
I could talk a little bit about it.

39
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,160
I know I know the interest in it, but I always said I wanted to get into what I've discovered

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,140
Now before I do that, we'll be real quick

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,900
It has nothing to do with any religion and what you've been told in school or on TV

42
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,280
Genesis if you read it actually, right

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,840
Just like anything right? You know how you got these people they want the Constitution. I'm like Constitution

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,040
That's horrible document that promotes

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,540
Unlawfulness and slavery and cheating and right and so

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,260
You know if you read it, you know, like for example, you know in the Constitution

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,920
It says that you know, there's a section in there about vagabonds, you know

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,240
The you could do anything you want to him. Basically. I'm just paraphrasing, right?

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,360
Right. So that's what a resident is when someone says I'm a resident of the United States or I'm a resident of whatever city

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,760
Ask him. Where do you live? Where do you inhabit? Where do you lawfully inhabit?

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,720
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just a resident

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,200
Okay, vagabond laws apply to you because you can only be a resident at a hotel a hospital a jail, right somewhere transient

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,460
So they've actually have the entire country admitting that they're transient so they could beat them up

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,620
And it's so funny when they had the protest the free speech zones

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,780
They have a little six by six cubicle fenced off with chain-link and that's your free speech zone. You know, you've seen that. Yeah

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,060
Yeah, I love it. I love it because these are idiots

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,480
They deserve that because all they got to do is read same thing with Genesis. It's a

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,400
It has a radical statement in the beginning

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,740
but before I get into it, there's been a lot of nitpicking on the historicity of it and

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,460
They've got the various hypotheses that mostly German scholars came up with in the 19th century that well

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,280
It's not as old as they say it is

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,920
Probably written so-and-so and it has this hypothesis that I put a different different like the Yahweh's the Elohim

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,720
They're probably they break it up how academics do now. Here's the interesting thing

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,900
Went back in the day. I think revolution radio is off the air, isn't it?

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,020
Cuz the other day somehow I looked it up to see if someone was still alive and I couldn't find it

66
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,160
You know freedom slips. There's a horrible place by the way. Oh, yeah

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,440
No, I remember that and you know, it was there a couple couple months back. It was

68
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,860
Okay, yeah because I went to the direct comm and it was a game online gaming

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,260
From Thailand. So Wow, right. So I know a far doesn't even show up anymore

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,400
I think yeah, it's a 404 or it just doesn't show so

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,480
I'll have to check into that as well again a few months ago

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,800
Those those two things did exist, but I haven't checked. Yeah, I think about a year ago for me. Yeah. Anyway when I was on there

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
Talking about this stuff

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,920
10 12 13 years ago

75
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,720
I was saying like they have this thing called cancel culture

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,220
If they don't if you become unpopular they cancel you like you never existed

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,360
Just like right now

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,740
The stuff that you found in libraries that was a hundred, you know

79
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,160
When I was studying the stuff the books weren't quite a hundred years old. It was 60 years old

80
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,360
And you can't find them now. They're there. They're burning them throwing them away putting them in underground

81
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,640
Facilities and they're putting everything online. It's been digitized, which is a form of

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,500
rewriting, right

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
So a lot of things are gone

84
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,400
And the subject matter will still be there, but the Google version is nothing like the book, right?

85
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,140
And this has been happening in our own lifetime in the last 40 years or less. I should say the last 10 years

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,540
intensively, right

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,720
so

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,940
What's interesting is like even I don't promote or endorse archaics he has this whole thing

89
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,660
About dark scriptures and how he speaks as if these he knows what the academics are saying are for sure and I'm like

90
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,200
It's three holes in your argument. So I don't blame that. He has a beef with Christianity, you know what I mean? Right?

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Because it's a gateway to

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,540
It's a gateway to being a good slave by the way

93
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,080
Alright, well, if you want to enslave people you make sure they're a good Christian, by the way, you know

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
I said, you know how you become a Christian?

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,880
You get a saw and you cut the top of your skull off you lean over some brains fall out

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Brains fall out then put your skull back on now. You're you get the certificate. You're a Christian for sure

97
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,480
They're the same with all religions, but that one's the worst by far because it promotes unlawfulness. They have no laws at all

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,720
Love your brother Jesus said no, I said that nasty work or whatever

99
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:38,060
It's not a law. All right, that's Mary Paddy. Whatever paddywhack kick-a-whack. Give a dog a bone type stuff, right?

100
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:45,540
It's not these are nice sounding sentiments that are meant to promote certain feelings. I mean, you see there's an exact emo

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,660
Through spellcasting right because this is somebody placing an emotion on you

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,960
Through these words

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,540
Yeah, like when the Ukraine war came out was oh, what about the children and then I heard someone else say what about I said

104
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,480
Do you see that on TV?

105
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,380
They're pushing the children. You know, they always use the children or Christmas is satanic, right? Oh, but the children right children

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,700
Yes, anyway, but the thing about Genesis want to throw that in because we don't really here's the thing

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,440
It doesn't matter. The thing is do you know what it says like the constitute back to the Constitution? It doesn't matter

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,380
For father's my ass

109
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,420
What does it say if you're gonna promote something, right? It's a form of communication, isn't it?

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,280
All right, so any any book let's say you you give a book and its author. Well

111
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,940
Years ago, it meant that you it was black ink on white paper

112
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,120
And then it became let's say made into a movie and then it became an audio book and now it's digital

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,140
So what is it? It's a communication. Yeah, it could be given many ways

114
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,380
So when you bring up the Bible and you bring up the Constitution you bring up

115
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,720
Who wrote Moby Dick not Emerson

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,260
Melville

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,660
Yeah, and all these other things it's a communication now

118
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,600
We can't just say it's an old book anymore because it's been reformatted and somewhat retained. So here's the thing

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,920
There's so much criticism about everything in anything both pro and con but yet there's no comprehension

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,380
All right, that's why you'll never catch me look if you put a gun to my head told me write a book

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,300
I said you're gonna pull the trigger right now because I'm never gonna write a book

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:30,340
right, because the reason you write books is for people to read and hopefully you're presuming at that point that people have

123
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,200
Comprehension and that's a big mistake

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,320
All right, because they don't know what the hell they're reading. So

125
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,419
Two presumptions to begin with anyway

126
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,840
I mean first of all that they'll make the effort to read then on top of it

127
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,580
Even if they make the effort to read it that they'll understand it. Isn't that like two steps?

128
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,620
Well, there's more than understanding. It's comprehension

129
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,220
in other words

130
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,060
The understanding is really when you string all the words together to make a point or a moral point

131
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,140
Oh a moral, but the comprehension is when you run across a word

132
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,320
Do you know what that word means and do you know what the significance of using that word is, right?

133
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,140
Okay, so it's a more like the bricks not the building the bricks and mortar not the building

134
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,620
Okay, you know when you look at if I show you just a close-up of bricks and mortar

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,100
You could you know could be any building right it could be a sidewalk even sure why not, right? Sure

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,380
So so this is the comprehension. Do you know how it's put together?

137
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,580
Why so back to the Genesis thing there were a few people that have taken it apart and looked at it studied it

138
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,500
Because it's not popular to do

139
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,100
So if you start talking about these things you and you spend enough time to learn them

140
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,940
And now it becomes a vocation. You will not have it as a vocation

141
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,080
You'll be eating out of garbage cans and sleeping on a park bench because that's just how the world is. So

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,520
so in essence what it is, it's basically a

143
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:55,440
Compilation of thoughts that are distilled down into another thought that's trying to prioritize certain things. Oh

144
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Boy, what the hell did he just say because you know when there's seven days of creation there really are three

145
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,740
There there are three days and three days are mentioned again in similar context, right?

146
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,080
So it sounds like seven days. There's

147
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,760
There but there are seven days that pass and also there is a concept of they're not 24 hour days or a thousand

148
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,020
Year days, that's a good concept

149
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:27,020
But I'm telling you that the whole thing was a thousand years and broken up into seven and it gets complex

150
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,200
It gets you have to bite. This is the kind of thing where

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,720
you know when you go to like cats is deli or the

152
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,580
Carnegie deli in New York and you order a sandwich and it's like four inches thick. Yeah, right

153
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,120
It's not like it's like oh my gosh. Hi. Where do I start? How I hold this thing, you know, right?

154
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,740
Okay, this is how this is. So when you say let's take a bite out of Genesis

155
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,700
It's like oh my gosh, you really can't bite that you have to kind of like you need a nut fork and a knife

156
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,540
You know what? I mean?

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,680
You got to open it up or something

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,400
You see it's not that it's not a sandwich that you could just take a bite of like, you know

159
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,480
A jail sandwich you can do it. This is really different. So it requires very

160
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,740
Well, it requires a conversation not a

161
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,420
Discussion, right? It's like what do you want to talk about? You know about Genesis, but here's the other thing

162
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,500
Regardless of when it was written who really if you know, whatever do you comprehend it? Okay

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,720
The other thing is what's going on with chapters the way they're divided. Yeah, that was supposedly so

164
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,320
It's like a grid system

165
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,400
So when scholars are communicating they can target the area that they want to talk about right just like when you give coordinates on a map

166
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Right. Well, I thought also because people used to verbalize this wasn't it?

167
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,480
Also designed to help with that because this way you had measures

168
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,620
So you could break it up in even parts. I mean because it was being verbalized

169
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,120
Right, it's a disadvantage to do that. We're in maps and cartography. It is an advantage, you know GPS, right?

170
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay, so so know what they did was they started dividing it to break the context out

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
So when you read Genesis chapter 1

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,620
It shouldn't end there and it doesn't end there

173
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:16,100
It actually ends in the after the third or fourth verse of chapter 2 because that's when the after it's an affidavit

174
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,500
It basically at the end of an affidavit, you know when you write you you sign it or state who's making this claim

175
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,480
Right that that is not in chapter 1

176
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,420
It's in the first after the first few verses of chapter 2 and when that claim is made

177
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,420
That's where you you you know, fold it up put it in an envelope, right?

178
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,080
You don't make a an affidavit three-quarters of a paragraph put in an envelope mail to someone

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,860
So where's the rest who wrote this? Well, that's coming in the next envelope

180
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,040
Then you just got three sentences that finish the thing it you just don't do that kind of stuff

181
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,280
No, you have to at least attach the pages together and say look this is part of this

182
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,460
And they're all together and and the thing is with an affidavit, right what you would do with anything is first

183
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,040
You would describe the parties involved the things at issue

184
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,980
What when where right is all right there at the top and then

185
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,440
Yeah, well the Y comes last because that's the thing that you know tells you what's happening

186
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,000
Right and then and then like you said who is actually attached to this is at the end

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,580
So there you go. That's a that's like a complete affidavit and that's good

188
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,660
It doesn't happen in chapter 1 and you finish chapters

189
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,220
I'm reading chapter 1 as soon as you finish chapter when you close the book. I'll have a sandwich, right?

190
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,500
You didn't finish it. You didn't get and then you pick up chapter 2. It's like, all right

191
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,420
This seems like it's just like coming out of nowhere. But you know, it's a whoa and who's this guy right here now

192
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,840
You see so anyway

193
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, that's that's the what I just mentioned is what I've been hammering. It is not a creation event. It is a remodeling event

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,140
They're right. It's everything is redone

195
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,200
huge super

196
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,340
super bad cataclysm

197
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,500
if you want to get into the

198
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,080
chronography a lot of the

199
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,160
Chronology stuff. I'm usually off between 50 and 100 years over a 6,000 year period

200
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,720
It's not so bad what I'm saying if you go to look at Archaic's his stuff again

201
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,840
I don't endorse Archaic's but his product, you know, I may not endorse someone but I can't but I can I'll admit one there

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,740
They're certain whatever work. I'll specify what's worth looking at, right?

203
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,700
You know, so a part of their work may indeed be very sound even though the whole thing is not

204
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,180
But yeah the chronology because he gives so many sources

205
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,380
Which I've come across also, but that's not my shtick

206
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,400
My shtick here is that I figured out that everything's wrong and it's not that hard to figure out right now. I'm not a

207
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,300
chronologist but

208
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,200
Usually when he states the the chronology of the flood when this was done with this

209
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,220
I'm usually like I usually say the the flood was 2,500 BC. Well, it's 2239 or

210
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,800
2238

211
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,160
Pretty close right over 4,500 years

212
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,120
Right hundred years is not bad. So

213
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,100
It's it's less than 1% So, you know, it's a little bit over 1% but anything less than 10% is good

214
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,480
So I'm usually between 1 2% off on the chronology

215
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,600
So so here if you want the chronology on these things go look at Archaic's again. I don't endure. Yeah, I

216
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,160
Don't endorse his stuff

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,900
And if you know enough Greek speak, you'll you'll be able to call him on it

218
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,320
So but here's the thing

219
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,560
It's a big deal I might get into it on a solo

220
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,660
Because it's not a sandwich. It's more like

221
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,540
When you when you want to eat this sandwich, you know again if you go to Katz's or Carnegie Deli

222
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,020
Forgive me for people who don't know the places I'm referring to be actually if you look it up on the Internet

223
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:56,220
There's plenty of YouTubes. I'm sure on Carnegie's daily and Katz's deli sandwiches, but they're as tall as they're as thick as they are

224
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,900
Long or wide, right? I don't like Second Avenue deli myself. But yeah, go ahead. Yes second Avenue deli

225
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,900
It's a better deal. Not the big lines. It's just as good. Right? Yeah, they actually it was not as commercial

226
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,240
Yeah, where the quality matter went down on the other ones. These guys kept it

227
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,540
Yeah, so

228
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, don't the New Yorkers know the secret spots, right?

229
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,220
So you but you were technically bridging tunnel. You didn't live in Manhattan. Did you ever I know I lived in Manhattan a while

230
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,360
I lived on the East Side. Oh, okay. So, okay. So you're not bridging tunnel

231
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,960
Because we used to make fun everybody's gonna go Times Square kidding that's all bridging tunnel people usually Jersey and suburbs, right?

232
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,080
No, I I think I might have said put in Times Square once and it was only because incidental

233
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,660
I mean, I really didn't go there. I I was in these village. I was over there right by Tompkins Square Park all the time

234
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,100
That's where I live. Yeah, and I lived there. Yeah

235
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,100
You know, but I also lived on 11th Street between 2nd and 3rd and why do you I mean NYU neighborhood?

236
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,380
Yeah, I was between 1st and a and NYU wasn't in there yet it was you know, Alphabet City was kind of a

237
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah, that went down when you got popular that share bought a building to turn it into co-ops or condos

238
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,960
remember Thompson Square Park was here's the first one her and someone else say they

239
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,760
Renovated a building to make it condos. I was like I'd say there goes the neighborhood

240
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,560
Yeah, and then there was somebody came in there

241
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,099
That was like secret and people were saying might have been Michael Jackson

242
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,620
But it wasn't and it was somebody else that didn't didn't go there to live but bought up a bunch of stuff for a little

243
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,720
Bit some some artist. I can't remember. Yeah

244
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,180
Could go down there when the Krishna's would show up with their bus and give out all the free food

245
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,960
I don't know if they were doing it when you were there. Yeah. No, that was it

246
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,160
Yeah, they would they would they and they would feed anybody

247
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,220
If you should it wasn't bad

248
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,620
It was not bad at all and they if you would sit and listen to their little spiel then you could have a tin of food

249
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah, oh, yeah our plate it was great. I love the basmati rice

250
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,440
I just asked you know, Michael about you know, the herbs and the focus, you know back then I was still into cooking

251
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,060
I was into cooking since I was a child

252
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,840
so anyway

253
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,080
You know these these sonics they go on tangents hopefully they come back but you can't set them to music, you know

254
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,220
They're all over the place sometimes. You know, I mean true enough true enough

255
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,780
We but but still with the Genesis thing it's interesting that that you have described this before as a

256
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,860
You know as a legal notice you used another word to that. That was really after the legal affidavit

257
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,280
Remodel. Mm-hmm. Oh, and it's yeah, that's the other thing is that when I've heard people say well

258
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,540
It's kind of like terraforming as opposed to creation. I go. Yeah, I think that's about right

259
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,440
you know, it's terraforming like climate change and

260
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,600
a

261
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,640
eugenics genetics

262
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,980
Right, it's taking something that exists. It's like molding with clay

263
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,320
You didn't create the clay, but you're working with it to take the clay and make it into something else

264
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,740
I mean that that's right about like that, right?

265
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,120
because the first Adam in the the first Adam the men and women are made together and

266
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
But they're classified as animals, by the way

267
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,780
Because it does it basically doesn't say ish and isha it says

268
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,400
Zahar and

269
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,000
Nicobar which are terms that you used to like male and female goats and cows and dogs and sheep not

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,980
It's not man and woman. It's male female, but typically using

271
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,420
the pronouns that you would use for livestock, right and

272
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,660
They were told to repopulate the earth and they were blessed

273
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,540
Now the the second one that was in the garden

274
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,460
he was pretty pathetic and

275
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,680
Because you know, there's no man. There's only man and there's no woman and then later, you know, you know the joke about the rib

276
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,780
right, so

277
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,020
They make the woman and they don't get any blessing and they're ousted and ostracized

278
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:02,700
Right, and there so the first one was a eugenics and the second Adam in the garden is a genetic

279
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,320
You know, whenever you see the EU prefix, yeah

280
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,500
that means good like

281
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,580
Evangelion Greek or

282
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,310
Euphoria the EU right euphoria eugenics means to make it good. It's the Greek prefix for good or satisfaction

283
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,040
So but it's been turned negative now like oh, that's part of eugenics program means like genocide and stuff like that

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,880
Usually it's used in that just like the word

285
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,780
Just like the word

286
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,640
Anarchy is used wrong, right? They've turned it the word gay is turned wrong, right?

287
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,280
all these things so

288
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,480
anyway, the first group was a eugenics and the second one was a basically a degenerate the the Adam that you read about in the

289
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,260
garden and

290
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,240
there's a reason for that and we can get into that when we discuss it basically the first group was too much like the gods and

291
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,740
The second group they made sure that they he wasn't like the gods even though he you know, I mean

292
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,300
So because the first one is very it says that the made him in the image of the gods

293
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,160
But the second one doesn't say that it just says it took some dust from the earth

294
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,520
You get it. It's very subtle sometimes

295
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,720
You know in

296
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,380
intelligence

297
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,140
Interrogators good detectives or whatever

298
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:31,600
They they teach them how to be a good interrogator and what you look for, you know, the four things for interrogation

299
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,720
Okay, no, okay

300
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,020
You'll like it. All right. First one is

301
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,240
Listen to what they're saying

302
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,420
Right. Yeah, the second one is listen to what they're not saying

303
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,300
the third one is

304
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:57,080
Look at how they're saying what they're saying and the fourth one is look at how they're not saying what they're not saying

305
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Basically body behavior right body language, right? Oh, yeah, and then there's the whole system that goes with that

306
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,840
I okay now I know what you're talking about

307
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,060
Yeah

308
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,860
And then they go into the whole system where there's all the different cues, you know

309
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,680
The raise of the eyebrow the change in pitch etc. Sure

310
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,160
Why is part two and part four which is listen and look at what they're not saying so important

311
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,260
Because when you selectively leave out something

312
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,680
It should be just as blatant as if you said it or pointed it out right when something's missing, right?

313
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,540
Well, yeah, for example, let me call it

314
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,160
Show me the virus, you know, how come there's no cure no remedy

315
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,740
How can we not promoting any remedies show me the virus they show you a cartoon and there's no remedy, right?

316
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay, we know it's a fraud right right by omission the much I revealed by omission

317
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,520
I forget where it says that but it says it somewhere. Anyway, yeah, the thing is it's

318
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,260
the the most subtle one by the way is to

319
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,400
Look at how they're not saying to well, obviously listening to what they're not saying and how they're not saying, you know

320
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,520
Right, so how they're not how they're presenting the the omission not just the omission

321
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,220
Because you can actually say you forgot about this part, but you don't right because that's that's part of the study, right?

322
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,940
So there's a lot of that in in Genesis and this is more like chapter two and three. So

323
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,740
yeah, that gets

324
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,960
Again, it's a it's a you can't just take a bite out of it here and there you either decide you're gonna split it

325
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,220
You know, let's go get that. We'll split it, you know the sandwich, but it's if you're gonna need it by yourself

326
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,320
It's probably lunch and dinner or you're gonna be really full if you try to eat it by yourself, right?

327
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Right, so we'll we'll address that somehow

328
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,260
So you think we did all right on that could move on the next subject that we don't know about yet. Absolutely good. Okay

329
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,000
One thing one thing I want to interject I say it's really hard to set music to these sonics, isn't it?

330
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,340
Right, you know what I mean by that?

331
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,580
It's like you got to pick a theme right either violins or happy dancers or some whatever, right?

332
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,280
You can't do that because it suits anyway

333
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,620
I wanted to bring up the

334
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:06,580
extol the purpose and use of spray bottles around the house predominantly with the silver and hydrogen peroxide because lately

335
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:13,800
We're having a heat wave here and I'm a little under the weather because of exhaustion heat exhaustion, which I'm doing something

336
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm changing the weather right now

337
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,880
because I let it go and

338
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,960
You know, like I said, I'm involved doing some stuff in industry. So

339
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,220
I've been focusing more on

340
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,160
Thinking about what I'm doing so I could talk about it to help others. Let's say right. Yes to help others

341
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,140
So what I noticed my usually around the house here is we've got a lot of stuff in spray bottles, right?

342
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,520
dollar store spray just empty spray bottles and the most useful thing is the

343
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,920
I

344
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,520
Said colloidal silver, but it's not when I say colloidal silver

345
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,400
It's got to have an asterisk next to it in the footnote is it's aqueous Argentum. There's no coalesce. No particles in there

346
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
I did drop an article in the chat about how nano

347
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,180
Particles meaning like the smaller the particle the better it is for the nervous system and the brain, right?

348
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,220
so

349
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:12,220
How about you get something that is imbued with the full quality of the substance, but has no particle at all

350
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,620
So they're telling you as the particle gets smaller to infinity

351
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,200
Because femto would be smaller than nano right a billion times smaller again or a million times smaller than a billion

352
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,100
Okay, so it'd be a trillionth not a billionth. But anyway, so so they're telling you as it gets smaller and smaller

353
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,440
It gets more beneficial. How about you imbue the substance into a fluid?

354
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,560
With no particles then what does it do? Oh my gosh homeopathic

355
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,080
So all the people who were lied about like you have made fun of and lied about right?

356
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,520
There's stuff on your bathroom are extremely powerful because there's nothing there, right?

357
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,720
The material it's all energy

358
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,360
And the thing is I was talking to someone recently

359
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,220
Midstream and they were kind of tolerating me and I was tolerating them. That makes any sense. Okay, right?

360
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,340
So I ran into them and I was like, oh, this is an intelligent person

361
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,180
I'll be easy on them, but they can't take what I have to say and they reciprocated the same with me

362
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,700
I could see it in their eyes, right?

363
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,160
This guy is saying stuff that is in the airy fairy cattle category, but he's not airy fairy

364
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Back telepathic kind of thing. Okay. So anyway, I was saying that energy medicine. There's no proof of that. I said energy

365
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,520
Okay, so, you know anything that radiation electricity is energy. Yeah, it's energy the

366
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,620
Electrons don't really are not particles. You know, this is yeah, that's a theory. I understand it's energy

367
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,880
Okay, so when people are sick with cancer, don't they give them radio radiation therapy in the main in the mainstream, right?

368
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,940
So what isn't radiation energy?

369
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,040
Right

370
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,280
Substance their best I can so yeah. Yep. So they do use they do acknowledge but it's toxic, right?

371
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:52,580
Look, it's it's so ironic that chemotherapy for cancer treatment chemo is what causes cancer and radiation therapy for cancer

372
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,880
The radiation is what causes cancer. So they're actually giving you more of a poison

373
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,700
I always found that to be bizarre

374
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,440
Actually the idea that like radiation can give you cancer and yet they give it to you when you have cancer

375
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,320
I always was like isn't that kind of a contradiction guys?

376
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,920
It is if it's not some of the hair of the dog that bit you or drinking it when you have a hangover

377
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,500
And it's nothing like that. No, it is deliberate. They're putting it in your face

378
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,040
You know, it's gotten to the college university

379
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,400
Education is in your face because it's very well known every anyone spoke to it's well established that anything past an eighth grade education

380
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,740
There's potential to do irreparable damage to the victim and everybody says yes

381
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,200
So what the hell are you doing from the 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 because you know

382
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,560
The grades keep going up to until doctor, right? So

383
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,220
Four years 13 14 15 right 16

384
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,220
Great, right, but somewhere around the second grade. I had that thought of like why is it you know, cuz it was just you know

385
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,000
Let somebody explain an adult explaining the world to me, right?

386
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,700
Yeah, you you get cancer. You can get cancer from radiation. And then when you have cancer they give you radiation and

387
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,080
I shake in my head like well, wait a minute if one thing causes

388
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,400
Yeah

389
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,320
Here's another way that tell you it's in your face on TV. They promote a drug right commercials

390
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,200
I don't know 30 seconds 40 seconds. I like three-minute commercials like in the 70s anymore, but 30-second commercial age

391
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Okay, first 10 seconds. The drug introduction is over in the last two-thirds of the commercial is what?

392
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,880
Side effects. Yeah, don't take this. Yeah may cause this that third thing

393
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,220
Hey, look, don't take this if you have a vaccine if you're gonna be near other people blah blah blah, you know

394
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,800
Chocolate milk can walk around breathe. Yeah, they cause it fatality, right?

395
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,200
Consolidated consult with your pharmacist to make sure your drugs don't interact with it because you might be taking other stuff to interact with it

396
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,900
Oh, yeah

397
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,820
Yeah, and they're telling you how bad it is and you still want it

398
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,180
Just like you want a college degree

399
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,020
Where it's already you should have been out of school when you were 14 or whatever

400
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,400
But anyway, it's that sick of a society back to the spray bottle in the aqua Sargento, right?

401
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,500
Okay

402
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,020
What it is?

403
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,340
You can apply the standard

404
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,820
Colloidal silver methodology, right? I think you even got involved with that, right? Yeah one point you so you familiar

405
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,720
They say oh, it's kills bacteria kills fungus. If you're sick, it'll knock things out of the body, whatever. Okay, that's fine

406
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,420
Does that as well, but it also changes things because silver is a

407
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,980
Noble metal. It's a master metal. Yeah, even in the Bible. It says silver is good for health. So

408
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,360
But we know the attributes let's say it's bacteria static

409
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,380
Bacteria side fungicide and all these other things. So it is a form of cleaning and stabilizing something

410
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,820
so let's say you're gonna put something water in a bottle and you're gonna put it away spray some of that in there first and

411
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,720
Put the cover on it with the fluid and put it away and you probably won't spoil right?

412
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,700
they do that chemically anyway, they

413
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,820
you know, I was at a

414
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,960
Pharmaceutical convention a long time ago boy the gifts they give you know the pharmaceutical convention

415
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,660
They invite doctors and people in industry

416
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,780
You go to the convention you go in the door you show your invite and all that and man the gifts they give the women

417
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:12,180
Got pearl necklaces the men get cigars and ties and all kinds of stuff. I'm talking about expensive stuff gifts, right for the attendees

418
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,900
About the bar and I was talking to the guy. So what do you thought I was impressed?

419
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,760
No, I'm just here with somebody else. And so what do you do? It says I probably never heard of it

420
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
I said try me he says well

421
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,420
I do fungicides and bacteria sides

422
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,680
but you never heard of it because it's not on the label on the ingredients because we add it to the package if we add it

423
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,560
To the package and don't add it to the food. It doesn't have to be listed or approved

424
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,040
But listen, if you spray, let's say you got a box of cereal

425
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,380
You got the liner inside, right?

426
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,620
You spray the chemicals in there and no one knows it's in there because it's not listed on the box

427
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you think when you put the flakes in there or whatever the fruit and the nuts?

428
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,080
Then you seal up the bag the chemicals gonna mix with the stuff you put in there. Of course it is

429
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,200
Right. Absolutely ingredient. It's an indirect ingredient legally illegally. It's not an ingredient, but you and I know right? Yeah

430
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
Well, that's the thing though

431
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,480
Look if you don't believe it

432
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Look, you take a standard perfume of any kind spray it in a bag and then put something in that bag

433
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,580
Even though you didn't spray it directly on the thing take that thing out of the bag a little while later

434
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,520
Guess what? It's got some of that perfume in it now

435
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,720
Or whatever substance it is or what? Yeah, I mean, I'm just going with the perfume because that's obvious

436
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,740
But I mean, it's extremely obvious you spray it

437
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,500
You'll be able to measure it with the olfactory

438
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,720
You could measure it. There's allergies and things like that

439
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,580
So I want to bring that up because storing fluids pickling things

440
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,540
So you're cleaning a jar now if you have a table, let's say you have a plastic bottle

441
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,620
You might want to save for later. You know, you wash it dry. It still gets sour

442
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,820
Okay, what you when you put it away, there's two ways what I do. First thing I do is I turn it over

443
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,480
drain it out dry it a little bit and I spray a little hydrogen peroxide because you'll never open a bottle of anything else hydrogen

444
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,940
Peroxide or you'll be sour, right?

445
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,440
The other thing I do is when I put the lid to close the lid on it

446
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,460
I put a piece of paper towel on the threads

447
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:05,280
So you don't really lock it down what that paper dowel does is it leaves a pathway for the everything in the bottle to breathe?

448
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,020
This is just for empty storage. All right, so you could pull a jar out and open it. I'll never be sour, right?

449
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,820
Okay. So the other thing I do this is I'm bouncing between hydrogen peroxide and the aqueous Argentum

450
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,160
When you're doing laundry, sometimes you got some sebum or BO left in the clothes or whatever

451
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,300
When it goes into the dryer the clothes dryer the tumble dryer

452
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:33,380
You put the white clothes in the tumble dryer and go ahead and spray some of the aqueous Argentum the silver solution

453
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,440
In the dryer with the clothes it's amazing because I was like, oh, these are like white t-shirts work shirts

454
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,660
I'm not gonna wash them again. It's summertime

455
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,280
Whatever that I do smell a little bit of BO even though it came out of the wash

456
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,480
I'm gonna spray some silver on it. See if it works right? It was like, oh my gosh it worked, right?

457
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,720
It's very simple stuff like that. The other thing is

458
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,420
I've mentioned this before have a bottle in the bathtub the aqueous Argentum and

459
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,120
And the hydrogen peroxide for people that have mold developing in the baths in the tub surround area

460
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,340
I don't back east if you you know

461
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,920
Sometimes you might live in a space and it's got a little tiny bathroom window or no window just a vent you get start developing

462
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,540
Mold mold on the grout on the tub surround almost always, right?

463
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,220
Yeah, I don't hear because it's got a big window and it's against the Easter wall

464
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,480
So but anyway a lot of sunlight a lot of UV here

465
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,540
Anyway use the peroxide instead of those bathroom cleaners, right?

466
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,840
The aqueous Argentum the silver solution is when you're done with the shower

467
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,500
You're still drip drying your water is off

468
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,880
Go ahead and grab the bottle and spray yourself with it before you towel down

469
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,320
What that'll do is it'll keep the towel smelling fresh and pressure longer, right?

470
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,220
Because the skin that comes off when you're drying will be stabilized

471
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,700
And also it'll get all over your skin and it actually by induction. It'll be almost the same as drinking it

472
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,660
I think about it, you know, like smoking, you know, what do they do? They give a patch

473
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:08,239
Right, it's topical. It'll be a topical thing. By the way, you know, it's a big deal in the public pools or whatever

474
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,380
Don't pee in the pool, right?

475
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,219
And if you sit and if you're laying in the bathtub with water in it, you want to pee whenever you get into water

476
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,280
You want most people feel like they have to pee that's because of an induction of water through the skin in the body

477
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,400
In other words the this entire

478
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,500
Surface of the skin is surrounded with water

479
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:26,880
Guess what?

480
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,340
It does if starts producing water inside the body and it displaces the existing water energy through the bladder

481
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,260
Well as soon as I get my hands wet washing dishes, I feel like I want to pee, you know to be honest

482
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,020
Which is my hands are wet even

483
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,179
For the old one when someone's sleeping put their hand in some warm water

484
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,920
Yeah, I always think of that but but seriously

485
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,940
I mean you don't get the urge when you're when you're washing dishes sometimes as soon as you get the water

486
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,219
Keep my urges to myself

487
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,360
No, no, I get you know, but I do have the urge when I get into a body of water

488
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,460
Yes, I feel well in the body of water too. Sure. Good. Yeah any body of water

489
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,800
You've been a shower because you are inducing that so that that legitimizes the patch therapies for different their patches

490
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,500
They even have a birth control patch, right? Yeah, there's nothing like that. Yeah

491
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,100
I

492
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,260
Want to throw this in there, you know the dollar store that pregnancy kits right for a dollar

493
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,420
Oh, you mean they did to detect pregnancy with the whole yeah, they can't stick. That's the same

494
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,680
That's the same thing modified. They charge three people corporate insurance people $3,000 for cancer screening

495
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,140
So if you know, you're not pregnant and you're a guy

496
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,500
And you're gonna go get cancer screening you get one of these dollars you pee on it if it shows you're pregnant guess what?

497
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,580
It's the same

498
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,400
Implement they're using when you pay 3,000 bucks to get cancer screening. It's the same things the dollar store

499
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,860
Pregnancy test. Anyway, I was always told I've detected growth hormone. I I don't know for certain just told

500
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,300
Cancer it means the body's working. Okay body wants to keep you going. It's a roadblock. It's like hey, dude

501
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,940
You've been screwing up for so long

502
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,900
Hey, let's say I give the analogy of a car accident

503
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,520
Hey, you're screwing you you're texting or changing the radio you get into a car accident

504
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,040
Right chances if you're looking at the radio or texting while you're driving with your chances of getting to a car accident increase like tenfold

505
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,340
Right, right. All right, you do that enough. Guess what? It's gonna catch up with you

506
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,920
You're gonna get into an accident, right?

507
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,860
And then what happens the cancer comes in other words, they block off the road don't think right

508
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,940
Okay, it's safer to block the road and direct traffic than just leave the accent in the middle of the road true

509
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,960
That's what the cancer is it's just saying hey you got these energies moving

510
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Too much of this and the body's natural flow has been disturbed. So we have to put a block you get it

511
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,540
No, like no cure it cure it and cure it

512
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,840
Right. That's why usually when they go after the block

513
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,320
It doesn't mean there isn't gonna be another accident. So you have to go after that don't change, you know better driving skills, right?

514
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
so anyway

515
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:09,620
Yeah, I just wanted to bring up those points because we're in a heat wave I've been doing some domestic work and I

516
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,380
Notice, you know when I speak and bring up things in a sonic and I do them in my own a day-to-day life

517
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,200
I noticed them more right and then I said, oh, you know, I didn't mention

518
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
this that and the other

519
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,060
and I

520
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,560
Am I am at the moment standardizing for someone wants a

521
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:37,040
Aqueous Argentum kit and I'm at the point now where I could standardize it and I and I have one or go

522
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,380
I have two of them here, but now I have a standard version and it's called

523
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,460
Silver made easy. Okay, and that comes from an old commercial called quilting made easy anyway

524
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,700
All right, so silver made easy

525
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,140
Okay

526
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:59,520
Why well, it's got the proper setup for the electrodes and the proper silver and guess what power is USB

527
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,180
USB so who doesn't have USB power

528
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,040
Right. It's easier, right? You got your anybody's got a phone or a computer's got, you know standard USB, you know

529
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,240
One or two or three, right?

530
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,020
And they're even building a lot of lamps and other stuff if you buy a new lamp

531
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,020
There's a lot of them have USB ports and I'm just a lamp by the way

532
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,000
Starbucks counter as it right when you go to coffee shops, they have it

533
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,120
That's what I call silver made easy and it has the it's five volts, which is way too much voltage

534
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,540
But it the it's got three neutral plates positive negative

535
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm deciding whether I should do a fourth plate to lower the voltage more

536
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,800
But it seems like the three neutrals and the positive negative work. Well, I've got it very stable

537
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,060
It's in a case and it's got a two and a half foot USB cable

538
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,300
Think about it in the car, you know where they got the cigarette lighter the power accessory all the cars have it now

539
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,900
Most people that have a car to have a cell phone have a charger like that, right?

540
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,480
Okay, right. So now you can make silver at Starbucks. You can be at a coffee shop

541
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,760
You can make it in the car

542
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,300
You can make it at home pretty much and in most homes you have those USB charges not just in one part of the house

543
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,140
But many parts of the house, right?

544
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,640
I actually bought one of those, you know

545
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,780
You put it in the two plugs and it may gives you six plugs one of those two things

546
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,320
I got one of those and it's got USB ports in it, too

547
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,540
You know, I just got one recently so

548
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,060
Yeah, no, absolutely

549
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,440
Call out a bus. Yeah

550
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,660
Well, you have a branch but yeah, so it couldn't be any easier than that because otherwise

551
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,300
Hey, honey, go get some batteries. I want to make some silver right? None of that. Mm-hmm, right, right and where's the battery?

552
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,060
I want to make some silver. What do you mean the battery? I didn't see it. Where is it? Right?

553
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,480
Okay, and also it will be very effective now it will

554
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,220
When I have the unit the one I send out it will be the standard one, you know, I think they are a

555
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,260
Sub here as well, and I did message them recently

556
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,520
It'll be the Cadillac. It's a Cadillac man of the silver

557
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,840
What's that it's a Cadillac, okay, it'll be the Cadillac of the silver and it'll be

558
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,880
They'll make really really good silver and consistent

559
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,280
And you don't have to clean it. Yeah, I wouldn't put it in coffee or coke just water

560
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,020
All right bottle what it's designed to use any type of water. You don't use distilled

561
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:21,980
Right

562
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,260
You said that before anything that is just, you know, a good clean steady kind of decent water cool clean water

563
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,620
Anything you would drink, right? That's what you know water any water that you portable bottled water is fine

564
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,100
you know as a better the water the better the

565
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:45,220
Situation whether you're making silver or not and also by the way, you know using the spray bottles to dilute the

566
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,880
detergent for laundry or for the sink

567
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,480
Very helpful, by the way, because I started doing that

568
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,900
Yeah, so what I'm gonna offer here is when I do this you ready?

569
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,360
When I'm gonna you know, the first rule of government spending why make one when you can make two or twice the price, right?

570
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,700
So what we're gonna do is when the first one goes out

571
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,240
I'll be field tested you're pretty soon and I'll feel test that what we're gonna do is we do a giveaway

572
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,720
So once it's the other ones ready

573
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,280
Chuck you're gonna go through all of the

574
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,560
Member all the subs here and randomly randomly pick one

575
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,280
you can either number them and have a random number generator picket or whatever randomly picket and

576
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,360
We'll announce

577
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,960
You'll probably send them an email if you would that you won this

578
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,980
No problem. I'll just send them an email and tell them to give us a postal address to us and I'll send it to them

579
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,240
Yeah

580
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,280
This first time I've ever done a giveaway. Okay, great. All right. Sounds good

581
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,660
Might as well. So that's what we'll do. So we're gonna give away a

582
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,240
silver made easy

583
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,300
To somebody when you're ready to put it out there to just one of these subs here

584
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,260
One of you guys who is a subscriber will get it and I'll set it up so there's a randomly picks

585
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,900
Yeah, so do a random pick you could have the dog picket maybe I don't know somebody they put your paw on one

586
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Well, well when you do random giveaways

587
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,240
We do is put all the names on a piece of paper in a jar you pick one out like the bingo

588
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,880
Or you could just assign a number in the whatever order they're in

589
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,840
You know

590
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,080
So if you pull a number if you let's say ten people you've got one through ten and you count down the list who's ten

591
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,160
Right, but let's say you pick seven who's the seventh, right? Well, I got Buster the weenie dog

592
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,260
I'm very sure that I could put him up to the screen and he can put his paw up on the screen

593
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,080
I can do that easy. Yeah, okay, either way, but however random pick and

594
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,100
Yeah, okay. So what that said

595
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,180
Enjoy your water. Enjoy your sober. There you go, and we'll do that
