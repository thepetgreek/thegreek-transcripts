1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:11,300
The sonic event 39 hitting the ground running best we can.

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,520
Anyway, Ocelli in the Greek, and you know what you're listening to because you're subscribed

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,340
if you're hearing it.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,200
So that's that.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
By the way, just a really quick note.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,120
Any rumors of this show's demise, this sonic event's demise, this element's demise out

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,820
there are exaggerated, at least for the moment.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,540
So, anyway, we are rolling, and gee, on the Pope's work schedule, we're toward the end

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,160
of the seventh month, but I know that's not the right day of the year, but kind of close,

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,940
I was going to say.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,180
Close enough.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,440
Yeah.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,520
If you reckon it, yeah, if you reckon it around that time now, it'll be a day off, two days

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
off when the next moon comes around.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,100
So yeah, it happens.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,220
They cycle around, yeah.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,720
Well, eventually, just like the broken clock, right?

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
It's got to come around and land that way.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,440
Yeah, pretty much.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,180
Yeah, okay.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,460
What else are they hiding?

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,640
What else is wrong, right?

23
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,220
Well, true enough.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,740
What else are they hiding?

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,880
Interesting stuff came up recently in a couple of emails and other contacts, let's call it,

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,960
like say I was on with Freeman recently by myself, which was clearly a different show

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,400
than what you and I would have done.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,340
Okay.

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,460
And the same that I would have done if I was alone.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,220
Right, right.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,100
You do a different thing.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,220
I mean, when we're separate, it's a different thing when we're together, it's a different

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,940
thing when we're separate.

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,760
That's the way it is.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,020
Anyways, so let's just get to a couple of odds and ends before we roll right into whatever's

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,200
really on your mind tonight.

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,660
So no, then we wouldn't be doing the sonic, but anyway, go ahead.

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,460
Okay.

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,020
Fair enough.

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,820
It's going to be one of those kind of events, folks.

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,240
Okay.

42
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,560
So I got a question about induction and I'm going to boil it down for you real easy so

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
that you don't have to go through the whole email and I'm not going to identify the person

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,580
on the email because I don't like to do that.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,900
But anyway, everything we, by the way, you Chuck or anyone that you send anything to,

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,700
it's always anonymous.

47
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,600
As a matter of fact, I don't even share it with Chuck and vice versa.

48
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,280
It's very, very private.

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,500
And in other words, everyone's privacy is respected in real time and in reality.

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
So I just want to put that out.

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,040
Yeah, no, we do absolutely respect everybody's privacy and we don't even cross pollinate with

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
emails or anything.

53
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,440
The only thing I will do is share, just like I'm about to do here verbally, hold on, especially

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,660
the one who sent me naked pictures of his girlfriend.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm not going to reveal that guy's identity, but anyway, go ahead where the picture is

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:35,960
good.

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,700
I said, I'm not going to reveal because if I anyway, well, you can say if the pictures

58
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,400
are good or bad.

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
I mean, everybody knows they got a variety of girlfriend out there and it could be a

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,160
lot of different ways.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
I knew that was going to get a soft topic.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,120
All right.

63
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,420
Go ahead.

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,340
What's the deal?

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,300
The email that I got.

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,580
Right.

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:51,880
OK.

68
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,980
And I did him to the Greek.

69
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,880
It's about induction.

70
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,100
Here's the thing.

71
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,820
They said, OK, now this is a new concept to me and they are not new to Greek speak exactly,

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,820
but they are new enough that the concept of induction is like, wow, OK, that's something

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,700
I have to consider.

74
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,020
They were asking about the sweating.

75
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:20,000
OK, so if you have induction and water is literally created inside the body, along

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,540
with other things, right, fluids, they actually got to are created inside the body based on

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,040
induction.

78
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,140
It's not a matter of it, you know, going through, seeping through the pores, filtering in.

79
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,240
So how about the going the other way?

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,500
They tell us that sweat comes out of our pores and comes out of the body.

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,480
Well, how does that work when it comes to the concept of induction?

82
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,580
If I accept absolutely that you're correct about this, which it seems like he is starting

83
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,820
to do, but he's examining it as he goes.

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,720
Does this make sense?

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:53,980
Easy.

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,500
Sweating.

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:54,820
Easy.

88
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,020
Very easy.

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,820
As a matter of fact, the other night I was on a long technical water conversation.

90
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,060
I brought this up, the sweat glands.

91
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,840
They produce water as what other things, mostly other things in water.

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,160
It works the other way.

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,620
I think I'm one of the sonics recently.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,700
I said, you know, when you jump in a pool, don't be in the pool or in a bathtub.

95
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:16,860
You want to pee.

96
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,959
That's not because the body senses all that water and makes new water.

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,220
Right.

98
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,520
Right.

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,800
Now, the concept of induction is is is a replication, just like if you have you want to dub two

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,460
cassette tapes, two magnetic tapes, you load one in one machine or, you know, the right

101
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,120
one side and you load the blank one on the other and it transfers the information over.

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,440
You need to start out with some of the material that is capable of transferring information.

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,180
Then you need the device, the device being every organic living organism.

104
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,560
Now, it does work both ways.

105
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,900
But that or that machine known as the skin, part of the machine, the body, the component

106
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,720
known as the skin.

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,180
We'll do it more from the inside out than the outside in.

109
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,060
Otherwise, the patch wouldn't work.

110
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,960
You know, the tobacco patch and other things like that, which, by the way, just quickly

111
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,320
addressing someone in the chat.

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,780
If I spray myself and I get with the aqua sargentum, do I get silver in my body?

113
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,580
Yes and no.

114
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,580
Again, because the skin will resist, you know, but it is the same as putting a silver coin.

115
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,180
If you have to ask that, you missed the point because it has to be by silver coin is not

116
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,300
biologically compatible.

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,380
You always got to look at biological compatibility.

118
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,820
That's why most Americans are so unhealthy, because most of the food they eat is just

119
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,020
not biocompatible.

120
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,560
Example, bologna, margarine, white bread, corn syrup.

121
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,140
Those things are.

122
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,920
Yes, they are slightly biological compatible, but not like whole foods.

123
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,160
Well, when you have a natural gelatin that's actually created from the ground up bones

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,660
of an animal, it might work somewhat.

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,020
But it's not something that really you should be consuming.

126
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,820
I think the bones are not generally something to be just well, you know, they can't.

127
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,880
They will have an effect simply because of their arrangement, energetic arrangement.

128
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,520
But their energetic arrangement is, again, not optimal.

129
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:14,680
But the body will pretty much synthesize anything and can induce anything on the periodic table.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,480
But certain combinations will block it and act like a resistor where other things will

131
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,740
not.

132
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,520
Other things, things that induce very quickly is in the category of a poison.

133
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,040
OK, well, now that was where I was going to just add one more question to this and let

134
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,020
you go back around to the sweat process.

135
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,140
Maybe if you just give a basic thumbnail sketch of how how it runs, that would be the best

136
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,820
way to answer it.

137
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,340
But before we go there, really quickly, you said, OK, why doesn't it work with, say, you're

138
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,980
holding a silver coin and you would produce silver in your body?

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,760
I get it.

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,020
But exposure to some types of metals and some people would say if you grind it up into a

141
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,160
silver powder.

142
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,520
That's through the lungs, which is more receptive than the skin.

143
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,700
Are you familiar with I try to look this up a few years ago, no luck other than another

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,520
subject of skin maladies, but it's a dermal luminescence.

145
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,400
You look that up now and they just talk about how when you have an infected area, the skin

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,860
will swell up and it's a phenomenon.

147
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,740
They named it after some medical guy, from what I recall.

148
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,780
But dermal luminescence back in the 50s and 60s and 70s was a lot of experimentations

149
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,620
where young children up until about the age of seven could read with the bottoms of the

150
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,980
feet and the palms of their hands, just as well as with their eyes.

151
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,280
So you could write the word cat and they read it on a card, right?

152
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,420
Or you put you don't show them the word and you just have them blindfolded or in a dark

153
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,460
room, put their hand over it and they'll read it, read with the palm of their hand or the

154
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,340
bottoms of their feet.

155
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,980
And this was a lot of studies were done on this.

156
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,980
So the skin is susceptible, photosensitive.

157
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,980
Let me just get into how the operation, the thing works.

158
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,540
You know, water likes to take an ovoid shape, usually like the bulb of an onion or an egg

159
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,040
or the chicken.

160
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,080
Anything that's going to hold water takes that ovoid shape.

161
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,460
If you look at the sweat gland, what does it look like?

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,080
There you go.

163
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,180
So it's optimizing itself for the water body.

164
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,120
Just like when you have you open a drawer, someone's kitchen utensils, you always recognize

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,240
the cookie cutters, right?

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,760
Yeah.

167
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,520
Because that's all, you know, the function, it just looks so much like what they should

168
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,020
be doing.

169
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,059
The way the induction works is just like any other form.

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,039
Like for example, look up how does ibuprofen work in a in a search, right?

171
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,520
And they're going to give you, you know, it's a basically a fat reaction, but it's a fat

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,260
and it's also a hormone and it's a pain receptor, blah, blah, blah.

173
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,280
And when you start reading about where this comes from and also what else it does, basically

174
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,360
it comes from inside the cell, an impervious cell that's produced outside of the cell.

175
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,200
They say the cell excretes it, but when you look at the cells, you'll see there's no opening

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,980
for it to go out, right?

177
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,620
So in other words, when I just gave a very sundry point, like look up how does ibuprofen

178
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,120
work and if you know what you're looking at, you'll see it's by induction.

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,700
Just like saying, hey, Chuck, I've got a old cassette tape, right?

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,840
You could even do this with lasers too, but I got it and I want to make a copy.

181
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,760
How does that work?

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,880
You can, anyone can pretty much explore what you need.

183
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,640
What if you have a boombox that doesn't have a record button on it?

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,420
You can't record, right?

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,620
Well, no, not necessarily true.

186
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,920
There is ways of transferring things without the record button because you can literally

187
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
have something like, I've done this with magnetic tapes accidentally, where if you

188
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,340
put them close together enough under just the right conditions, the information-

189
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,620
It'll ghost.

190
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,980
It'll ghost over, but it won't make any sense.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,420
You'll play one song and hear the middle or wherever geometrically it worked.

192
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,440
That works as well.

193
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Yeah.

194
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Let me just go back to do a simple search and how does ibuprofen work?

195
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,400
How does this work?

196
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,140
How does that work?

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,640
It's like any drug, right?

198
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,640
You will see that it's usually a blocker of a receptor or a stimulator of something in

199
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,040
the body.

200
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,640
When you look at the function of what it's blocking or stimulating, it doesn't make,

201
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,460
there's no physical way that's happening.

202
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
It's actually being reproduced.

203
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,300
What they lay out is, look, here's the chemical pathway for this.

204
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,660
Here's the receptor for it.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,120
This is how it works.

206
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,500
They tell you where the wires are.

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,880
They tell you how the plug is, but they don't explain exactly how it travels because-

208
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,020
Go ahead.

209
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:37,940
No.

210
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,760
They show you everything that it's not happening coming out of the cell, even though they say

211
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,580
it comes out of the cell.

212
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,080
Wait a second.

213
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,560
It's like, how does it come out of the cell?

214
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,480
Where is it coming out of the cell?

215
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,540
There's no opening in the cell wall, right?

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
It's lying through omission, but they're giving you-

217
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,020
When you lie through omission, for example, not you, but anyone, you're actually, it's

218
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,680
by omission.

219
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,940
That means that everything that you've put out is true, right?

220
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,280
You just left out certain things that make all those true things fit together neatly.

221
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,960
You see?

222
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,820
That's what lying by omission is.

223
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,300
Everything you said is the truth, but he's lying by omission.

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,380
There is a lie when they say it comes out of the cell.

225
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,560
They just don't tell you how.

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,940
Just like when you're dubbing the cassette tape, and I make a copy, and the copy's done.

227
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,180
I say, didn't this second copy, didn't this copy of that tape come out of that tape?

228
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,500
The first one?

229
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,740
But I didn't tell anyone.

230
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,180
No one knows how the magnetic works, and they don't care to.

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
This is one of the things that leads me to mental and spiritual desperation.

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,260
Everybody cover their ears.

233
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm just going to tell you, Chuck, why the hell am I the only person talking about this

234
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,180
publicly?

235
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
That's fucking scary.

236
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm using a medical term there, right?

237
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,480
Sorry.

238
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,400
That is scary, that the Greek is the only one boasting and roasting about organic and

239
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,740
biological induction and biological vacuum.

240
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,700
Yeah, Schauburger talked a little bit about biological vacuum, or water naturally does,

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:06,980
right?

242
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,540
But why am I the only one?

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,700
It can't be.

244
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Now, here's the thing.

245
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,120
It only takes one person talking about it publicly, but I bet there are scores and scores of people

246
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,040
behind the scenes that know about this since time immemorial that are working with it.

247
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,720
And they're not offering it.

248
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,760
Yeah, frankly, it never occurred to me exactly what was happening until you said it.

249
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,580
And now what it's done is change the way I'm looking at a bunch of things, because I'm

250
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,240
saying to myself, well, if we take this concept, okay, and understand that this is a missing

251
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,980
piece that's always been missing, it begins to change a lot of things here, okay?

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,160
It's not about, okay, this has to be digested, and, yeah.

253
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Hold on.

254
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,600
It's not missing.

255
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,260
It's missing cognitively.

256
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,400
It's only missing between years, or it's only missing in the language.

257
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
It's only missing in the communication.

258
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,620
It's only missing in the method and the process that people hold in their minds as how things

259
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,040
work.

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,880
It's not missing.

261
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,440
It's happening.

262
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,420
Because if it wasn't happening, we wouldn't be here.

263
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,520
Oh, no.

264
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,080
I get it.

265
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,620
I mean, that's why I love that there's a podcast I used to really enjoy called How Things Work.

266
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,280
And what it would do is literally lay these things out, and they would put a lot of connective

267
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,020
tissue together, a lot better than what everybody else was doing.

268
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,440
And it was like, well, see, it's all those little missing pieces in the process are what

269
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,940
makes ... Now, it wasn't Joe Rogan successful or anything.

270
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,920
I think it still exists, maybe.

271
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:32,740
Yeah.

272
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,480
The problem is, okay, just like the Bible, you start talking about the Bible.

273
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,000
If you don't say, this is going to be a discussion on the Bible, and by the way, there are no

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,380
translations in any other language before you start, right?

275
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,440
Because you see, and if you start using how things work, and you start using stock scientific

276
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
principles, it's not going to work.

277
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,360
You know why?

278
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,360
Because I assure you, not these guys or other guys, when they talk about how the body works,

279
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,160
they're going to say, what about nutrition?

280
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,320
It's absorbed.

281
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:04,920
How?

282
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,460
How?

283
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:05,860
How?

284
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,240
Show me.

285
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Show me the ... You can't.

286
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,600
They use ... By the way, I've been down that road, and I've been down several roads with

287
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,160
people in the alternative, all fields, about, hey, listen, if you want to be more successful

288
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,440
in getting this out to people, and actually getting it into the hands of people who actually

289
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,320
use it, you're going to have to use different language.

290
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,640
You can't say the body is absorbing nutrition, because it's not.

291
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,840
Right?

292
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,280
You see?

293
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,700
This is where the catch-22 is.

294
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,940
Let me just divert for a moment.

295
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,780
Sure.

296
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,380
You know how you have a hole?

297
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
Something is the hole.

298
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,920
I mean, it's about mixing and holes, okay, and hole, W-H-O-L-E, right?

299
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:46,980
Okay.

300
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,280
Okay.

301
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,640
When you have a hole, and you have a part of that hole, and you're holding that part,

302
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,220
you identify it as a part, because it came from something else that you consider to be

303
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,600
a hole.

304
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,560
When you hold that part in your hand that you're calling a part, guess what?

305
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,060
That is also a hole within itself, isn't it?

306
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh, right.

307
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
That's hole in itself, right?

308
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,360
Yeah.

309
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
You take out your oil filter.

310
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,100
Yeah, you take out your oil filter out of the car.

311
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,440
Okay.

312
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,280
It is a part of the car, but it is also a hole oil filter.

313
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Oil filter.

314
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,160
Right.

315
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,540
Exactly.

316
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:16,840
Okay.

317
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,400
Right?

318
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,380
Now, you break it down, and you just tear off a piece of the sidewall.

319
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,280
It's a piece of sheet metal.

320
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,500
It's a part of the oil filter, but it is, in itself, sheet metal, right, as a category.

321
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,860
You see?

322
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,340
It's a hole chunk of this.

323
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,240
It's a hole piece of that.

324
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,460
Right.

325
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,760
Hole, and again, one more time, W-H-O-L-E, the entire or complete hole.

326
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:36,860
Yes.

327
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,440
It's in itself its entirety, so every fragment in itself is its entirety.

328
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,540
So if people are trying to comprehend how the physical body works, the part where they

329
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:57,300
say absorption, right, or whatever, that is a hole in itself, meaning that part of absorption

330
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,780
takes over all of the other processes and methods and objects involved in how the human

331
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,100
body works, and now you walk away thinking you're a pressurized filter bag.

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,340
Yeah.

333
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,740
You see?

334
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,820
You see?

335
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,820
Well, every single process in the body, no matter what, at some point, you have to confront

336
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,680
this because you're in a constant state of doing this.

337
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,240
Yes.

338
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,460
The body is completely sealed, by the way.

339
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,480
There is nothing.

340
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,800
It's completely sealed, just like a thermos or a vacuum, you see?

341
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
You ever get a thermos where it doesn't keep things hot or cold anymore?

342
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
It must be leaking, right?

343
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,220
No, that's not the problem, but yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

344
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,720
In other words, the vacuum is lost, right?

345
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:37,940
Right.

346
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,800
Right.

347
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,200
But no, look.

348
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,460
Very simple.

349
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,360
There are certain things within the apparatus of communication that if taken as a whole,

350
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,900
even though they're a part, it will become the whole.

351
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,100
So in other words, you could study the entire body and have a pretty good knowledge.

352
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm not just talking about the terms.

353
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,140
The moment you believe you're absorbing, you are now, everything you've ever learned, you'll

354
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,520
be walking around thinking that things are actually permeating through tissue in the

355
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,800
body.

356
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,359
And what that does, it allows you to buy all the other stuff.

357
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:15,240
So that's how a little bit of yeast leavens the entire lump, right?

358
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,020
That's how that works.

359
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Now, here's the other part.

360
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,460
There is an inseparable part, this is the part I said about mixing.

361
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,200
I'll give you a story, back in a village in Greece about 100 years ago, a man was running

362
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,360
a general store, happens to be a relative of mine.

363
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,440
And the gypsies would come through and everybody hated when the gypsies came through because

364
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,120
you just didn't know how they were going to get you this time.

365
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
They were really slick.

366
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,340
Right.

367
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,120
And I'm not talking about old gypsy stories where they knock when they know only the woman

368
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,120
is at home with the young children and they knock on the door and they're preoccupying

369
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,040
the one in the front door while the other ones are robbing the back, right?

370
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,540
Kind of thing.

371
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,500
Not like that.

372
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,780
All right.

373
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,120
So here's an old gypsy story.

374
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,280
No offense to any gypsies that might be listening, but anyway.

375
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,660
General store, you have bins of bulk beans and rice and flour, right?

376
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,680
And each one sold independently and weighed out.

377
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,420
So gypsy comes in, he's got a sack and he throws in two scoops of beans, same sack through

378
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,380
two scoops of flour, same sack, throws in two scoops of rice.

379
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,000
He goes to pay for it.

380
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,980
It's 11 drachma.

381
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,420
He only has two drachma.

382
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,160
He says, OK, if I only know if it's not enough here, take it back.

383
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,460
So he hands the store owner back a sack that's got flour and beans and rice mixed in together.

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,680
It's going to cost him more than the balance.

385
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,340
You know what I mean?

386
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,060
To separate that or throw it away.

387
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,140
He'd rather make the two drachma.

388
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,540
Right.

389
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,280
You see what I mean?

390
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,760
Got you.

391
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,100
I'll give it to you for the two drachma.

392
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,340
Because what am I going to do with it now?

393
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,700
Yeah.

394
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,120
I got it.

395
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,980
It's going to cost me more than nine drachma to clean it up.

396
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,260
Right.

397
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,580
And don't ever come here again.

398
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,040
That wasn't planning on anyway.

399
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,480
Right.

400
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,940
Of course.

401
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,320
OK.

402
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,840
So the same guy.

403
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,860
So.

404
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,920
So this is what's going on with them also.

405
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,280
Now here with people, it was so easy if you took people that were aware and you put them

406
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,480
on a country or an island or whatever, and then the other island, this is their stories

407
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,560
written about this, by the way, but more robots and other things and put the people that were

408
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,100
not aware on a continent, because that's what you would need and separate them.

409
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,140
And you have one society that's enlightened and forward moving and almost close to what

410
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,000
they call utopia.

411
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,180
By the way, the word utopia means no man's land.

412
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,560
Right.

413
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,480
But anyway, or better land.

414
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,420
And then the other continent would be like pretty much like it is now.

415
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:35,940
OK.

416
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't have that.

417
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,300
Right.

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,360
You can.

419
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,900
You can.

420
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,380
You'd have to be able to defend it.

421
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,560
It's possible.

422
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,000
But that's not how it is.

423
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,420
Everybody's mixed in.

424
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,380
Right.

425
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,100
Right.

426
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,420
And even if you try to restrict communication and all that, too, there's that other concept

427
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,940
of the what is it, the hundredth monkey or whatever, where even if it is sitting there

428
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,800
permeating all by itself, somehow by induction, even without direct contact, those ideas travel.

429
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,180
Now, they may not travel in whole, so to speak, but somehow, you know, you teach monkeys on

430
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,720
one island to use tools and the other island, they start learning to use tools, even though

431
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,180
they've never seen the other monkeys or had communication with them.

432
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,520
Yeah.

433
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,780
That's by what?

434
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,580
By induction.

435
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Induction somehow.

436
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,160
Right.

437
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,820
It just seems to be communicated without a standard communication being in place.

438
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,860
So there's action at a distance, just like you can copy a tape from another tape at a

439
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,220
distance.

440
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:29,720
Right.

441
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,680
It's all action at a distance, even within the body itself.

442
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,600
You know, the concept of fractal, you know, if you look at each cell and you study it,

443
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,060
it's like a small planet or a small, you know, whatever.

444
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,500
And by the way, there are single celled organisms that are up in the sky.

445
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,840
They're as large as a county.

446
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,000
Trevor James Constable was photographing them all the time.

447
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,960
They look just like amoebas, but they're about 100 miles wide.

448
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,440
Right.

449
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:52,820
Right.

450
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:53,860
Anyway.

451
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,120
OK.

452
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,420
So the part about the mixing.

453
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,520
So here's the thing.

454
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,220
You're all stuck in the bag.

455
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,340
So back to the rice, the flour and the and the beans mixed in the bag, it would be great

456
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,380
to come up with a recipe where you don't have to separate all that stuff and you've got

457
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,640
a dish that you could make out of that right up right off the cuff.

458
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:09,940
Right.

459
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,040
OK.

460
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,600
So the dish right now is this.

461
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,560
I tell people a lot of stuff about body nutrition, scientific stuff or whatever, and I say, work

462
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,400
with what you got.

463
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:27,200
What have I what have I been saying for three decades now is all of the grunt work, the

464
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,880
hard, heavy, digging, heavy, moving, heavy hauling has been done by mechanistic material

465
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,440
science.

466
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,760
Right.

467
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,220
Let's leave the denial and the censorship out right now.

468
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,120
So you have a base.

469
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,160
It's a good base if you don't want to know material to a certain point, because a lot

470
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,440
of the stuff they said about material, like the human body is unintuitive that you absorb.

471
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:45,720
Right.

472
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,120
Right.

473
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,140
So then you figure out how things really work and see if you can mix the two or go a couple

474
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,940
of sonics ago.

475
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,020
I said, hey, I'm getting older and I'm pushing hard sometimes.

476
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,440
I take a fistful of ibuprofen if I have to.

477
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,860
It's better than putting up with the pain.

478
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,220
Right.

479
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,800
OK.

480
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,340
You see.

481
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,220
So why?

482
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,300
There are other methods.

483
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:05,740
Yeah, sure.

484
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,900
But I find them to be convenient and they're actually pretty weak for, you know, there's

485
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,800
So you ever hear about people overdosing on fentanyl because it's like there I think it's

486
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,080
what, 20, 30, 40 times more potent than heroin.

487
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,360
Right.

488
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,920
Right.

489
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,880
OK.

490
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,980
And they overdose on it easy.

491
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,260
I've heard of people that that doesn't do anything for them.

492
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:25,860
Right.

493
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,560
Because guess what?

494
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,880
Well, we went over that already because they're not they can induce it.

495
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,100
Their body somehow cannot reproduce it.

496
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,440
So here's the part about everything being mixed together and the way society is right

497
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,680
now.

498
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,900
There is a level of communication.

499
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,660
It's all communication, by the way, that can be implemented by certain individuals that

500
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:55,820
even the most staunch mainstream closed down NPC can follow into the more ethereal or the

501
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,500
better way.

502
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,120
Right.

503
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,620
OK.

504
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,180
That communication to follow.

505
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,400
But each NPC will be different.

506
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,680
You might run into one NPC and they'll be totally cool with it.

507
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,740
And the other NPC will just reject it before you even open your mouth because they sense

508
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,480
it's going to be a drastic change to them.

509
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Just the way a dog.

510
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,740
Two people approach a dog behind a fence.

511
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,540
One person's a dog lover, the other person's afraid of dogs.

512
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,680
If you let that dog out, guess who's going to bite first without either one saying anything

513
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,500
or doing anything.

514
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
Dog's going to bite the one who's afraid.

515
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:26,760
Yeah.

516
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,480
The one that's afraid.

517
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:27,740
Right.

518
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,800
How does he know?

519
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,620
He just picks up on that subtle energy.

520
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:30,880
Right.

521
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,460
So the subtle component with people.

522
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,740
Like I said, there was a table set up for vaccines and I was with someone who was an

523
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,960
anti-vaxxer and he started yelling at the nurses and they were laughing at him.

524
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
You're one of those whack jobs, loose nuts.

525
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,620
Oh, yeah.

526
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,780
You saw this on Facebook.

527
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,780
Yeah.

528
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,240
Or so.

529
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,400
Or they'll see you when he's active.

530
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,460
They want to get.

531
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,100
Don't care.

532
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,900
People are sick.

533
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,360
You're selfish.

534
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,740
And I go to the rest.

535
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,160
Are you taking into account body weight, blood type, sex and all that?

536
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,500
And she's like, oh, are they packed up?

537
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,860
They packed up.

538
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,820
They didn't say they couldn't look at me straight in the eye many, many times.

539
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,220
Why?

540
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:07,860
Same.

541
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
Now, who had the better effect?

542
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,880
You certainly did.

543
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,880
Obviously.

544
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,760
Now, what did I do?

545
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,880
Did I criticize them for what they were doing?

546
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,000
No, I criticized them for what?

547
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,480
What they weren't doing.

548
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,820
Well, you asked a proper question, which they did not want to answer.

549
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,900
So you got.

550
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,840
Well, here's the thing.

551
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,960
There was an older nurse that knew this.

552
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,260
The younger ones didn't know that the younger ones were ready to kick the same line that

553
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,320
they kicked to the other guy.

554
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,720
What does that tell you?

555
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,100
Their education has changed.

556
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,720
Of course.

557
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,880
One of the women were in their 60s.

558
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,320
She knew.

559
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,040
OK, so.

560
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,700
All right.

561
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,300
So what was put in that?

562
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,580
Because I'm going to have to come back to it for another email.

563
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,220
But go ahead.

564
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,240
No.

565
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,300
OK, so that's.

566
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,900
So this is around.

567
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,700
Look, these sonics, it's kind of hard to set them to music, right?

568
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,640
Yeah, for sure.

569
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,000
So.

570
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
So what's the other email?

571
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,540
Well, the other email actually had to do about an older sonic that we did regarding external

572
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,040
input, which fits perfectly into the conversation.

573
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,240
That's why I'm bringing it out.

574
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,740
And the thing is, they were talking about dreams and they had listened to the recent

575
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,920
discussion about the inner voice.

576
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:18,260
Now, if we are all at all times subject to external input, how does one source or sort?

577
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,960
Excuse me.

578
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,520
The difference between what is coming from external input in your dreams and what may

579
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,820
indeed be coming from your true internal voice during a dream state, because they

580
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,080
are kind of confused as to what is happening when they're having disturbing dreams.

581
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,360
So yeah, that was an interesting.

582
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,080
Yeah.

583
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,880
Easy.

584
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,180
The same beings are similar beings.

585
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,540
Let's say the ones that give you the voice that you think is your voice and the dreams

586
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,820
is considered the military.

587
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,540
Within the military, you have Navy, Army, Air Force, right?

588
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,240
Different branches.

589
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,700
Sure.

590
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,380
Within these beings, the waking conscious voice that you think is you because it sounds

591
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:56,860
like you.

592
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,260
Right.

593
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,200
And it both.

594
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,680
It's morally flexible.

595
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,780
So part of you says, for example, oh, I want to go get that.

596
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,460
But oh, that.

597
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,140
But the other party says that's wrong.

598
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,860
It controls both sides.

599
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,920
Right.

600
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,700
OK.

601
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,700
So the way you stop the dreams and the way you stop the external input is when you anticipate

602
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,100
it.

603
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,140
If you think that you're being overrun by voices and you say, OK, I hear your voices

604
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,800
and all that.

605
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,400
But what do you have to say now?

606
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,800
And the moment you tell them that you're anticipating that you're listening, they stop.

607
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,740
Because that's that's not how they're supposed to.

608
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,160
You're supposed to think that it's you.

609
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,340
The moment you anticipate them, you're busted.

610
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,300
They stop.

611
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,000
They can't keep talking because if they keep talking, they're just going to give up, give

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,740
up the whole thing.

613
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Right.

614
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,400
OK.

615
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,780
The same with dreams.

616
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,800
If you there's two ways.

617
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,940
One is.

618
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:57,160
You want to people go to fantasy parks or brothels or movies or these external entertainment.

619
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,080
Right.

620
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,480
They pay.

621
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:04,800
Why not say I want to go to bed tonight and I want to go to a brothel in ancient India.

622
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,280
I want to dream about that.

623
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,060
Right.

624
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,560
OK.

625
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,940
The chances of you dreaming at all is like next to nothing the moment you say that because

626
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,240
you just anticipated it.

627
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,440
Right.

628
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Well, I've noticed that when I wanted to return to something like let's just keep it real

629
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,560
general, say I, you know, gotten to some like really cool scenario and I was enjoying myself

630
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,160
in the dream.

631
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,620
The next night, I, you know, kind of say to myself, oh, I want to I used to do this a

632
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,100
long time ago.

633
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,340
I want to go back to that.

634
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,300
I want to go, you know, visit that place again.

635
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,300
That doesn't happen.

636
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,320
OK.

637
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,840
Here, here.

638
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,380
Let me inject something here for whatever it's worth, because you can get information

639
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,100
from anywhere.

640
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,080
And if you have enough, how would you call it, Moxie to source out the bullshit from the

641
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,860
good stuff?

642
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,880
It's still good.

643
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,080
It doesn't matter where it comes from.

644
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,640
It's information.

645
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,220
It's information.

646
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,560
Right.

647
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,060
Right.

648
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,780
Years ago, when I was looking into all this stuff, I got word from someone that every paranormal

649
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:08,680
research facility ever known, whether it's Vanilla Surface or Black Project, that what

650
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,340
they all agree on when they research dreams, psychics, remote viewing, astral projection,

651
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,660
ET abduction.

652
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,540
OK.

653
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,660
What they all agreed on is this one thing that when we sleep, our consciousness is being

654
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,700
used somewhere else.

655
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,060
That's what they all agreed on.

656
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,740
They don't know why or how or when they each have their own program of specialty.

657
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Right.

658
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,360
But what they all agreed on is that when we're sleeping, that sleep function, yes, it's tied

659
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,080
in biologically.

660
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,260
You know, if you don't sleep for a week, you die, maybe less, right?

661
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:41,940
Right.

662
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Biology.

663
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,260
The biology just just kicks in, just blows a fuse and you're done.

664
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,140
Right.

665
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,600
But not blows a fuse.

666
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,240
The bus bar burns out.

667
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,820
You're done.

668
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,540
Most cases, sleep deprivation is a form of torture, by the way.

669
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:54,840
Right.

670
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,020
Right.

671
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:00,340
Sleep deprivation is recognized worldwide by every single organization possible.

672
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,120
That is a way of torturing somebody.

673
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,420
Yes.

674
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,460
To death possibly.

675
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,060
Right.

676
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,680
As well.

677
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:05,980
Right.

678
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:13,900
So all of these these research, quote unquote, groups, both vanilla and black, meaning above

679
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,080
board that you they write, you see their stuff in art, scientific magazines and the black

680
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,040
ops that you can surmise.

681
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,800
They all agree whether that we're being used.

682
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,900
OK, now that is a question that I cannot answer directly.

683
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,280
I'll give you something personal.

684
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,360
All right.

685
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,800
So when I'm in a pinch, either emotionally, spiritually or physically or whatever, and

686
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,560
I need a break.

687
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,120
Yeah.

688
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,980
And it's just like when I'm in a pinch, meaning like I have a heavy burden on me because let's

689
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,460
say I'm making something and it has to be delivered on a certain time and it ain't going

690
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,400
right or it's not good enough for me and I just don't have the time to make it better.

691
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,920
And I need to clear my mind.

692
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,460
And I know you walk away from a few minutes, do something different, right?

693
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,180
Come back to it.

694
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,940
It doesn't clear whether it's relationship based, work based, anything.

695
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,360
What I do.

696
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,100
This is this is I'll share this.

697
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,680
I imagine that there is a parallel world with me just like me might look a little different.

698
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,180
Like once I had a dream that I looked in the mirror and it was a short Latin guy.

699
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:17,960
OK.

700
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,520
Right.

701
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,620
I was like, wait a second.

702
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,360
That's not me.

703
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:20,880
Right.

704
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,260
Right.

705
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,480
I imagine that there is another parallel world running.

706
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,060
That's me.

707
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,940
My spirit's being shared there and they're not having this problem.

708
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,800
They're enjoying something else at the moment.

709
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,480
Then, boom, when I come back, it's as if I really got away from what I wanted to get

710
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,060
away from.

711
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,060
Hmm.

712
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,300
You know what I mean?

713
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:38,640
OK.

714
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,420
Yeah.

715
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,080
It's like Greek.

716
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,900
You got imaginary.

717
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,240
Well, that works for me.

718
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,380
I just wanted to share that.

719
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,020
That there is a parallel.

720
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,540
You wait.

721
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:47,800
Wait.

722
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:55,300
If our sleep is being used, we're being our consciousness is being used when we're sleeping

723
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,620
in there.

724
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,340
Mostly everyone agreed to the researchers and stuff.

725
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,600
How far off is what I just said?

726
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,740
That's an area that there is a parallel world with another one of me.

727
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,120
And I just go there, share their consciousness for a moment.

728
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,700
And then I come back here in my mind.

729
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,500
And I did get the clearing, the break that I needed.

730
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,080
Right.

731
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,360
Well, to some degree or another, almost anybody who attempts, you know, either self-help or,

732
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,160
you know, or spiritual guidance or personal guidance, life coach, all these types of people,

733
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,220
no matter how useless most of them appear to be, almost none of them would complain

734
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,220
about the idea of positive visualization.

735
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,840
Right.

736
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,440
Where if you simply take yourself mentally out of the situation, you know, by your own

737
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,820
will and go somewhere else and envision something positive, this is usually a helpful thing.

738
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,520
Right.

739
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,180
Yeah.

740
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,000
One way or another.

741
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,340
Like you want a Ferrari.

742
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,560
You know, they got Nishin, what is it, Nishin Daikonen.

743
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,200
What's her name?

744
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,160
She recently died.

745
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,720
Tina Turner.

746
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,620
She's into that.

747
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,080
It's a form of Shintoism where you meditate.

748
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,700
So there's a crane and you chant Nishin Daikonen, something like that.

749
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,080
And in that you envision you want a red Corvette, you want a red Corvette.

750
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,820
You meditate like that every day, you chant 15 minutes a day, somehow within a short time

751
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,860
you'll get a red Corvette.

752
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,880
Right.

753
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,860
I don't know if you know about the Nishin Daikonen, they call it.

754
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,140
Yeah.

755
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,920
No, I agree with it.

756
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,100
Yeah.

757
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,020
Yeah.

758
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,400
It's to manifest things.

759
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:26,600
Right.

760
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,380
That's part of it.

761
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,500
That's a very, maybe 10%, 5% of it.

762
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,180
Okay.

763
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,680
So if you know there's a parallel reality and in this reality, you want to, let's say

764
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,360
a Corvette, you don't have one and you can't afford, you don't know how you're going to

765
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,760
afford one.

766
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,820
Start thinking every day like, oh, I got to go pick up my red Corvette.

767
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
It's getting an oil change.

768
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,800
Maybe it's done now.

769
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,840
I know this sounds crazy.

770
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,700
Maybe you say, oh, don't say you just keep creating psychosis.

771
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,020
Right.

772
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,580
Yeah.

773
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,760
I could create a psychosis.

774
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,160
Right.

775
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,300
Uh, but if you're, if you're not in control, but in this, in essence, that is one way to

776
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,840
manifest, you know, that, uh, that feeling, because if you don't look, you know how the

777
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,800
universe gives stuff people when they're ready to get it right.

778
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,660
If you don't have something and you want something, but you act as if you have it, you're going

779
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,880
to see if you're ready for it.

780
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,700
The moment you start acting as if you have it, don't you, you might want something and

781
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,040
you never thought that you should act like you should have that thing.

782
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,300
And the moment you really start emailing, let's say the email gets involved.

783
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,540
I'm not talking about the email.

784
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,740
I talk about, but emotionally you feel like you have it and it scares the living daylights

785
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,180
out of you.

786
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,620
Hmm.

787
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,240
You might want to rethink wanting to have that.

788
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:27,480
Right.

789
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,060
Yeah.

790
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,360
Of course.

791
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,620
You see how well that works.

792
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,760
Now I wanted to get into a couple other things.

793
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,980
Do you want to go, go on with the messages you've got?

794
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
No, I think that's good.

795
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,700
I mean, there might've been a couple of things in chat you might want to address.

796
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,420
Um, yeah, I'm outside right now.

797
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm doing this on a stupid rectangle, uh, because I think there was noise on the other

798
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,660
end of the house.

799
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,540
So this is what I wanted to bring up from memory.

800
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,160
I went through, uh, the earlier things that I picked up on was what the silver, a couple

801
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,720
of questions that, um, uh, were a little off one.

802
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,180
It makes me wonder if people are actually getting what I'm saying and I'm not going

803
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,240
to cover that part.

804
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm just going to cover that.

805
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,020
This concept.

806
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,219
Well, a couple of people were excited.

807
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,280
I just want to note that a couple of people were excited.

808
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,920
But some of the questions were a little off from, from the, the, the, the mindset that

809
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,820
I like to communicate and the mindset is if it's not biocompatible, it's not, it doesn't

810
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,800
mean it's 100% not, but it's going to be materialistically, you know, like in material science, in order

811
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,840
to get a certain by a chemical or vitamin in the body, you have to physically, you know,

812
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,060
get it into the body.

813
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,420
Right.

814
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,900
And I'm saying that the body, if you were to be exposed to it, the body doesn't take

815
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,340
it in physically, even though it appears physically it's induced.

816
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:44,620
Right.

817
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,699
So it has to be biocompatible.

818
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,320
What biocompatible means that it's ready to be ready for induction, right?

819
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,239
It's like, you know, T remember the years ago, the TVs, they said cable ready on them.

820
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,460
Right.

821
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:55,980
Oh yeah.

822
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,260
Right.

823
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay.

824
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,980
So stuff like they have to be induction ready.

825
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,520
So with the silver, this is the thing also, there was a question about charge.

826
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,400
If you spray it, does the charge go away?

827
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,780
I've given the analogy before.

828
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,880
And the one thing I want to address also, there's a lot of new people that haven't been

829
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
listening to Greek speak for years, like many have.

830
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,920
So we have to kind of recap.

831
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,340
And every time you recap, it comes out a little different and throws in a little more, you

832
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,060
know, detail.

833
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,260
Let's say we gave, I gave an example with water.

834
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,800
It's very interesting.

835
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,140
Please I don't want to get into water in it because I'm actually working on water intensely

836
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,520
now for the past month or so.

837
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
And there's a lot I can say about it.

838
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,060
And then, and you know, the old adage, the more you study or you think, you know you realize

839
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,480
how little, you know, yes.

840
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,780
I'm getting to that point where it's scary and scary and what's going on.

841
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,720
It's beyond anything I've ever talked about.

842
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,480
But let's go back to the part with when you spray and with the water.

843
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,800
Chuck, I'm on one end of a large swimming pool.

844
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,480
You're on the other end of a swimming pool.

845
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,620
You drop you drop a glass of water on your end and I take a glass of water on my end.

846
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,900
Is it the same water?

847
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,220
No.

848
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,740
No.

849
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,980
Are you sure about that?

850
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,060
I don't think it is.

851
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,660
I think it is not specifically the same water.

852
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,560
It does change the amount if we have glasses that are the same size.

853
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,180
Yeah.

854
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,360
I mean, I mean, what the water can do.

855
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,880
What I'm trying to say is this.

856
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,080
Once the water integrates, once you drop water in somewhere, it becomes water.

857
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,320
Right.

858
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,120
OK.

859
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:34,000
So the charge that's held in the spray bubble when you atomize the liquid.

860
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,220
By the way, I might have to revisit that because that's a big conversation on its own.

861
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,080
And there's several ways you can view it.

862
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,340
Right.

863
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,560
But either way you view it, it shows you how big this this topic is.

864
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,540
When you spray, if you get a close up camera with some ultraviolet or infrared light and

865
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,360
you look at the little spray atomization bubbles, they look like like water spheres floating

866
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,840
in the air.

867
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,040
Right.

868
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,240
Or moving through the air.

869
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,400
And if you zoom in on it and you fill the picture frame with it and you ask someone,

870
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,120
how big is that?

871
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,780
I don't know how big that is.

872
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,600
It looks pretty big.

873
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,840
Right.

874
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,280
Yeah.

875
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,900
Like you ever see a close up of the ball on the end of a ballpoint pen, a good close

876
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,020
up.

877
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,440
It looks like a bowling ball.

878
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,720
Depends on how much you enlarge the image in the resolution.

879
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,860
Or an ant can look like a giant monster, depending on how you view it.

880
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,440
OK, fine.

881
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:19,760
Sure.

882
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,880
Well, what I'm telling you is the water body itself is is a water body.

883
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,020
That little atomized droplet is a water body, just like an Olympic sized swimming pool is

884
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,660
a water body.

885
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,600
Right.

886
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,000
Not an ocean or a lake.

887
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,680
Because those are different.

888
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,040
There are types of those are living.

889
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,960
You can classify a sea, an ocean, a lake and a river as being an independent animal, like

890
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,920
a wolf, a dog and a fox.

891
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,500
OK.

892
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:42,880
Right.

893
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,840
Even though they're independent.

894
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,100
Those are three different independent.

895
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,060
They're not all canine, but they're considered.

896
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,640
But they're not.

897
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:56,520
So this charge that's held on that once it makes its landing, it decides whether or not

898
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,200
it's the same material or not.

899
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,260
And that's where the charge prevails or not.

900
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,080
In other words, opposites do not attract all these same things attract.

901
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:12,100
But for example, when you put water on a freshly waxed car hood, the water beads up because

902
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,880
it was all as if all the water wants to join itself together.

903
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,660
Actually, it does.

904
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,940
If you you know, when the water beads on a wax surface, if you just move it left to right,

905
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,020
you'll see those little beads attaching to each other.

906
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,460
Yes.

907
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,740
Right.

908
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,260
They will.

909
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,520
And then they'll break off again.

910
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,260
OK.

911
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,840
If you pour hot wax on that wax thing, it would just lay down just fine.

912
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,000
I'll be on the hood saying, oh, I love you.

913
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,460
I love you.

914
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,660
Right.

915
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,980
Not not pulling away.

916
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,240
Right.

917
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,620
Right.

918
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,880
So like always goes with like.

919
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,560
And just like, for example, in classification and mining, you know, the heavies go to the

920
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,860
bottom.

921
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,020
Not some of the heavies, all of the heavies and all the light things go up to the top

922
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,640
liquefaction.

923
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,000
Right.

924
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,320
Right.

925
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,720
Not some of the light things.

926
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,280
All of the light things go up.

927
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,580
Right.

928
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,440
So these classifications and determinations are based on like goes with like.

929
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,780
Right.

930
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,340
If like goes with like didn't work, about 90 percent of all industrial processes would

931
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:01,940
not work.

932
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,540
So our natural processes also.

933
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:13,240
So when the water droplet, again, I feel like I'm doing a thesis on this, sees the skin

934
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,140
as a charge.

935
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,780
We just let's say the water droplet holds a charge.

936
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,800
It's not as much as a pool of water, an Olympic sized swimming pool, but it's the same.

937
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,940
It holds the charge exactly the same way.

938
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,760
Exactly the same way.

939
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,940
And when it meets the skin, it sees something that can induce in both directions.

940
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,080
But more induction on the way out than the way in for water.

941
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:35,740
Right.

942
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,220
OK.

943
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,800
OK.

944
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
So you'll sweat more than you'll pee more.

945
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,080
Right.

946
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,080
Or in other words, your body can still take in water through the skin, but not enough

947
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,500
to satisfy you to keep you from dying of thirst, you see.

948
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:53,220
And by the way, you will live longer if you're in fresh water in your skin and we can't drink

949
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,360
it.

950
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,720
Then if you're in salt water, because when you're in salt water, you'll die of thirst

951
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,620
faster because the water is going to also induce the salt.

952
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,060
Right.

953
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,640
Right.

954
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,640
It's very simple.

955
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
You will not separate.

956
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,260
You're not a reverse osmosis.

957
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,020
So this gets into, again, the member we just mentioned, fentanyl is killing people because

958
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,100
it's 20, 30, 40, 50 times, depending on the mix, stronger than heroin.

959
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,640
But there's people I've heard that can take it all day like gummy bears.

960
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,380
It doesn't do anything.

961
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:19,860
Right.

962
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,440
Right.

963
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,960
The charge effect on the body is exactly the same.

964
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,440
So that is a big subject.

965
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,440
That's why I always mentioned to people what I do is I bring up a scenario.

966
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,360
I bring up the aqua sargentum and then I bring up how you can use it and how you can use it,

967
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,240
meaning you put it in a spray bottle.

968
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,220
Very, very handy.

969
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,180
Easier than pouring.

970
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,680
Actually, just putting something in a spray bottle and misting it will last a lot longer

971
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
than pouring it.

972
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:47,980
Right.

973
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,660
Of course.

974
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,800
And also it holds more of a charge because each droplet, the surface area of each droplet

975
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,280
picks up the charge in the air.

976
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:55,840
Right.

977
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,340
Because you see lightning in the air.

978
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,300
You don't see it underwater.

979
00:40:59,740 --> 00:40:59,960
Right.

980
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,160
It is possible, but it's unlikely.

981
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,360
So yeah, in other words, the field's collapsing and it'll draw more energy to itself.

982
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,720
So that is a big, big question.

983
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,160
And the thing is, that's why I suggest to people I'll bring up a scenario, let's say skin condition

984
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,680
that's having, you're having a hard time.

985
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,460
Try this.

986
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,100
It doesn't mean it'll work every time.

987
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,420
Right.

988
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,560
This is not square, square peg and square hole stuff.

989
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:26,880
Right.

990
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,120
And I'm not saying take a square peg and whittle it to round to make it fit in a round hole

991
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,400
either.

992
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,360
Right.

993
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,280
So these things are things that need to be brought out that I feel, believe it or not,

994
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,220
need to be brought up because they'll help people on the on a dime.

995
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,880
This is like nickel and dime stuff.

996
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,200
Right.

997
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,220
Very, very inexpensive, very easy to do and exponential increase in quality of life.

998
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,900
The other thing I wanted to bring up, I think Vandy asked in there about mold on the inside

999
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,360
of a stone building, oxygenate it.

1000
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,880
That was the quick, you know how you use bleach to get rid of mold?

1001
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,200
Yeah.

1002
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,320
Sodium hypochlorite is a very strong, what, oxygenator.

1003
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:05,900
Right.

1004
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,620
Hydrogen peroxide is a oxygenator, but it's not in the form of a salt.

1005
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,760
So it doesn't stick around as long.

1006
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,820
The word oxygen means sharp, generating in Greek, right?

1007
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,280
Oxis means like, you know, right.

1008
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,760
Be careful.

1009
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,480
That's oxis.

1010
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,060
That's sharp.

1011
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,360
Right.

1012
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,440
Like usually the tip of a point or quick.

1013
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,400
So oxygenating several ways to do it.

1014
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:39,060
If you can't, if you don't have any quote unquote chemical oxygenators acids, if you

1015
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,720
have a, let's say you want to produce oxygen, right?

1016
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,280
With from water.

1017
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,360
The side of the device that produces oxygen and electrolysis is always acidic.

1018
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,580
The side that produces hydrogen is always alkaline.

1019
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,420
So hydrogen is alkaline, oxygen is an acid.

1020
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,400
So if you have a mildew problem and you don't have oxygenators like industrial ones like

1021
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,880
hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite, which is just laundry bleach, right?

1022
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
You guess what?

1023
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,020
Another typical thing is vinegar.

1024
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,220
Vinegar is acidic, isn't it?

1025
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,320
Yeah.

1026
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,780
Lemon juice.

1027
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,240
Actually, I would rather be spraying vinegar than spraying bleach.

1028
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,760
You know, yeah.

1029
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,620
Fumes from vinegar are not going to kill you.

1030
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,300
You know, they can hurt you.

1031
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,060
They can hurt you.

1032
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,960
They can make you go blind, actually.

1033
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,800
But yeah, but you, you're more likely to injure yourself with fumes from the others.

1034
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,760
Oh yeah.

1035
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:34,860
Yeah.

1036
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,080
Yeah.

1037
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,660
A long term, long term chronic condition too.

1038
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,660
Bleach, you know, bleach in an enclosed area, not good.

1039
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,860
You know, I mean, I'm just saying you get too high of a concentration in the lungs and

1040
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,680
it becomes a problem.

1041
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,340
Yeah.

1042
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,160
And if you have ammonia around and you mix bleach, guess what you get?

1043
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,060
Oh yeah.

1044
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,860
Well, that's the, uh, mustard mustard gas.

1045
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,080
Yeah.

1046
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah.

1047
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,900
So rudimentary.

1048
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,280
Anyway.

1049
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:55,860
Yeah.

1050
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,640
I'm surprised they have bleach and ammonia at this in the supermarkets on the same aisle.

1051
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,460
Somebody just running down the aisle with a big razor blade, you know, anyway.

1052
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,120
You know, I often think of that. Why are they like right next to each other on the shelf?

1053
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,820
Don't people think, you know, these, you don't want to mix them together.

1054
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,100
It's like putting fireworks next to the barbecue fluid or something, or I don't know,

1055
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,700
next to the cigarette lighters, whatever. Yeah. Not everything is for our interest, right?

1056
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,700
Yeah. I don't know. I've always said that.

1057
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:27,000
I just wanted to bring that up with mold and mildew. And by the way, they do some of the self,

1058
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,900
the household hint books and stuff do talk about the using vinegar. Actually,

1059
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,080
even I was at a dollar store recently. Now they're putting out cleaning vinegar

1060
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,260
instead of, you know, all the chemicals. I haven't seen that yet. Okay.

1061
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,380
Yeah. It's okay. It's, it's denatured. So it doesn't smell like it doesn't have that

1062
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,460
pungent smell. It has a little bit of soap in it.

1063
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,360
I saw club soda bottled that way, but I've never seen vinegar bottled that way.

1064
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,280
You know, like a club soda to clean like, you know, a cloth and things.

1065
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,960
I don't know. I've never seen that.

1066
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,200
Yeah. They had club soda like that for a little bit, but yeah.

1067
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,780
Yeah. So anyway, most of these things require strong oxygenation and acids do that. Anybody

1068
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,880
drops acid on a side of muriatic acid, sulfuric acid starts foaming up, right?

1069
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,740
Or just the same way, anything that oxygenate does. So acids oxygenate. So acids for mold and

1070
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:22,560
mildew, which are anaerobic conditions, anaerobic meaning anaerobic, meaning lack of oxygen. You

1071
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,740
get moisture, you get a water leak, right? And you pull up the carpet a week later, what do you

1072
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,760
see? Mold, right? You don't see it right on top of the carpet. Usually you don't, or on the wall

1073
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,960
where it's open. Usually it's behind areas that don't get air circulation.

1074
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,240
Right. That's, that's how it is. It's denied air or it makes right. Yeah, exactly.

1075
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah. So anything that has anything like that and certain types of bacterial growth, also acid

1076
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,840
is the way to go. A lemon juice is another, you know, there's so many citric acid powder that

1077
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,040
you can get it anywhere. They use it. Yeah. People buy it for canning. People make jams and

1078
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,600
so any, any goods grocery store will sell citric acid powder crystals, you know, for the canners.

1079
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,320
Actually they're, they're not encouraging canning. And they consider you a survivalist. If you say

1080
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,880
you're canning, they make fun of you, right? Now you're a prepper, right? Yeah. Right. Right.

1081
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
But you could still get it. It's usually about 10 bucks a pound in Australia, probably 30 bucks

1082
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,820
a pound, but always have that on hand. If you don't use vinegar, by the way, or citric acid in

1083
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,680
a washing machine regularly, because the type of acetyl and nitrile rubber that they use for all

1084
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,380
the hoses is very susceptible and all your hoses will deteriorate. I mean, crumble. And you know

1085
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,180
what that means with a washing machine and wash cycle. So yeah, right. They'll, they'll dry up

1086
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:44,160
kind of in split. Oh, you will lose. Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you put it on max load and you

1087
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,100
wonder where, yeah. And the second floor, you ruin the whole house. So yeah, don't use a, you

1088
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,920
could use it once a year to clean it out and, but do a cycle right away, but don't use it when there's

1089
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,920
rubber around, don't use it on swimming pools, things like that. Right. Eat away. Right. So be,

1090
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,860
be smart about it. The only thing I wanted to throw out the washing machine thing, because

1091
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,440
I'd say about a quarter of the washing machines are most three quarters of the washing machines

1092
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,760
that people think they need to keep using vinegar or better laundry will destroy the washing machine

1093
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,800
and their house. So I just wanted to put that out just in case people are whatever.

1094
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,660
Well, it's like once in a while, it's good to, you know, throw, throw like a cap full of bleach

1095
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,980
in there and run it with nothing in it, you know, kind of thing. That's good once in a while,

1096
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,340
but not all the time. No, the best thing is to, well, I shouldn't say, but you need to start

1097
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,520
water. Everybody's got to improve their water quality. And maybe in the near future, we'll

1098
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,860
get more into that, make it more readily available. But right now when it's been

1099
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,260
becoming a hell of a ride for me. So. All right. Absolutely. Look,

1100
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,900
this has been a great piece. Now, did you have something else you wanted to grab from chat

1101
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,880
or because I was thinking, no, it's just one more thing from memory is they got into a little

1102
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,880
bit of some old rits about the soul being the breath and the spirit being the mind and the heart.

1103
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,620
Okay. And these, these are hard to find because the past 500 years, they've messed up all the

1104
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,520
definitions, right? It got actually so messed up that we actually wish each other a nice day.

1105
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,500
Think about that. That's pretty messed up. Yeah. So, so if you go back more than 500 years,

1106
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,480
it was commonly known, well, not common, but it was well known that the spirit is the mind

1107
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,080
and the personality. The soul is the metabolism. What allows living things to be alive. It's

1108
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:29,320
interchangeable amongst all living things. Right. And that was, and that just came up and how the

1109
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:37,660
which means spirit in Chinese or close to it or heart is very close to the PSI in Greek, right?

1110
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,420
Shen side, very not too far off. Right. Right. So I think that's, that's it for now. I can go

1111
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,240
check out the chat and, you know, literally look at it again, but anything for you?

1112
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,020
No. Yeah. One more thing, actually. But, but just to tack on to what you were saying,

1113
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,140
it's very interesting. You look at the language today, there's still some of it preserved there

1114
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:04,240
because psychology is what it's not about the, you know, it's the mind. Okay. But

1115
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,160
psi is also spirit, right? It's like both things. The mind, the spirit is the mind.

1116
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:16,720
Right. But both things are in the definition. So a psychologist and someone who is into the psychic

1117
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,400
things, et cetera, et cetera, you're talking about, and I don't mean psychic, like, you know,

1118
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,260
dial me up 1-800-whatever. It's the same, the same prefix, psychotic, psychopath,

1119
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,720
psychiatrist, psychologist, all of these things, mind and spirit are the same.

1120
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,140
The same, right? Because your mind is who you are and your spirit is who you are, but your pneuma,

1121
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:44,140
where you get pneumatic, pneumonia, right? Right. Means the movement of air. What's the first thing

1122
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,460
even in the movies say? Is he breathing? No, he's not breathing. I guess he's done.

1123
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,820
Yeah. Right. That's your pneuma. They switch it. It's very easy to deflect. Just switch.

1124
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,180
Look, if you want to keep a, if I want to give you a combination to my locker

1125
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:04,580
and you know that the first two numbers are reversed, I could say, Hey, combination for my

1126
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,080
lockers, five, three, one, Chuck. But we already, you already know the first two numbers have to

1127
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,540
be reversed for it to work. So when you get the five, three, one, you say, oh, so the combination

1128
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,760
is three, five, one, right? Right. See how it works. That's how it's all you got to do is put

1129
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,920
everything out, but just make it so it's in the wrong order. Exactly. So look, the last thing I

1130
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,700
wanted to go through, and then we'll, we'll bring this one to a close is a, is pretty simple. It

1131
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,700
came up because of the current events actually. And, uh, just wanted to see if you had anything

1132
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,140
to say about it, because I know you're probably not paying too much attention to any of this, but

1133
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,600
Bobby Kennedy jr. Is out there making some statements and they sort of attacked him.

1134
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,500
I found it interesting, not because of the political element of it or any of that,

1135
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:54,640
but, uh, he was talking about who was susceptible to certain things. And, uh, and he said that,

1136
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:00,500
you know, uh, certain people are not as susceptible to, uh, the, the, you know, the virus,

1137
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,980
whatever. Okay. Now look, forget, forget the premise. All right. Uh, here's the thing about

1138
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,520
it that I found interesting is that they started calling him racist and all this other stuff. Um,

1139
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:18,080
and I said to myself, but this is idiocy due to the fact that, uh, ethnicity, uh, has something

1140
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,180
to do with what you're susceptible to or not. There is, you know, and I'm not saying that

1141
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:29,600
people should be treated differently, medical racism, medical racism. Yeah. Which is weird

1142
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,720
because I'm sorry. There's scientific fact. That's true. That's certain. Look the most basic

1143
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,960
low hanging fruit really quick. And then I want you to attack it is this, um, the sickle cell

1144
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,940
anemia, right? Okay. Uh, look, not everybody is susceptible to sickle cell anemia. Okay. Only

1145
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,080
that is black or no, I'm sorry. Black Cooley's anemia is for black people. Sickle cell anemia

1146
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,980
is a certain European group. No, no, no. Other way around. Other way around. Okay. Sickle cell is,

1147
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,360
is, uh, you, you have to have African blood. You have to be, uh, you know, yeah. It's when the

1148
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,240
cell inverts itself and it does, it clumps or it doesn't quite get right now. Cooley's anemia,

1149
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,860
quite frankly, is, uh, Italians get it. And why? Because they actually share some ethnic heritage

1150
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:22,980
with Africa. This is the reason why. And it is almost the same thing. It's much more severe

1151
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:27,860
than that, but go ahead. Well, I'm just saying in a general sense though, right? If you're Irish,

1152
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:34,720
say, or if you're a Lithuanian, the likelihood of you getting sickle cell anemia is very low. Now,

1153
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,000
all I'm saying is or non-existent or non-existent. Yeah. Very, very low non-existent. However you

1154
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,860
want to go. The point is that based on ethnicity, there is just a truth that some things are,

1155
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,740
you know, present themselves more often and not you brought up one time. And this is where I'm

1156
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:55,220
going to link it all together and hand it to you brought up. And, uh, you know, it's apparently

1157
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:02,880
true. They don't sell certain drugs in Asia. Why? Because it is completely destructive

1158
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:10,380
to their physiology. Prozac to be exact. There you go. Okay. But that's a scientific reality.

1159
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,300
That is not about racism. That's not saying treat Asians differently. You know what I'm saying?

1160
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,740
Like if you said we should treat Asians differently than we should treat, you know,

1161
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,940
white people under the law. Yeah. I think you should treat different ethnicities different

1162
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,120
because that preserves their culture. Well, yes. But, but, but equal, but equal protection

1163
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,820
under the law, equal rights under the law. Well, that happens anyway, unless the law is competency

1164
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,240
in order for the law to be competent, to be applied to someone, whether it's backwards,

1165
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:44,260
the person has to be competent. Okay. If you stood good, if you're going to trial, uh,

1166
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:50,680
tomorrow to court, uh, let's say, uh, about, uh, you stealing a horse and on your way to

1167
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,500
court the next morning, you steal another horse and get caught. That that trial is for the horse

1168
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,720
that you were accused of stealing prior, not the one you just stole, but it's pretty damn convincing

1169
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,820
that you're a horse thief. You know what I mean? You see what I mean? Let's just put it this way.

1170
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,960
You go into court because you were caught stealing a car and on your way to court,

1171
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,860
you steal another car and get caught. Uh, it's going to be kind of hard. They shouldn't,

1172
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,820
they can't use that. You just stole a car as evidence that you stole the other one,

1173
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,480
but the character, uh, shows speaks for itself, right? Okay. You should be found guilty for

1174
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,500
stealing cars or horses at that point, because that's your character, right? Yeah. Give me an

1175
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,160
example. Every culture and race should be treated differently. If you want to preserve that culture

1176
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:42,660
and race, an example, I'll give a loose example. When I'm watching, uh, what they call a movie or

1177
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:47,200
something, even recently, there's watching some piece of a movie, a trailer from an old movie

1178
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,120
where Nicholas Cage is in a bathrobe laying down in bed. And the camera comes from the end, uh,

1179
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,160
his bedroom, uh, and the camera comes from the end and it's almost passes like a big giant,

1180
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,420
like almost not a zoom, but his, his, the bottoms of his feet are in most of the frame and then

1181
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,760
goes up the robe and shows his face on a telephone. Okay. Okay. If that film is going to be shown in

1182
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,140
the middle East, that entire scene has to be edited out because in the middle East,

1183
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,080
if you show the bottoms of your feet, that's like in a Western culture,

1184
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,400
showing the middle finger. Okay. You see that? So, so I keep pointing that out. Oh, you see that

1185
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,560
showing the bottoms of the feet here? That's that would be edited out. If it was shown in Yemen,

1186
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:32,500
Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, it would be edited out. I assure you for sure that would be edited out

1187
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,440
the whole scene. So, or it'd be adjusted. You could tell some, you're a watch a film that's

1188
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,520
made for another country. It looks certain scenes look really grainy because they have to zoom in

1189
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,760
only in the part that's appropriate to show. And when they zoom in on it, they lose resolution.

1190
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Right. So, okay. So you have to adjust based on the culture and because that is slightly

1191
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:58,680
different race that you can say, right. Race has culture as well. We'll see. But adjusting actions

1192
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,980
based on culture is one thing to say that recognizing that there is a difference because

1193
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:11,000
of cultural realities and ethnic realities is yet another. Okay. Let me, let me get more specific

1194
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,020
on the stuff that I've been repeating for a long time. Sure. I'm an anesthesiologist. I paid two

1195
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,040
and a half million dollars a year in insurance. Yes. Anesthesiologists, as I think there may

1196
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:26,640
premiums might be higher than that. Okay. Right. Okay. I have two, I have to put two people down

1197
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:36,100
down, but you anesthetize them. I have two people coming to me for an apodectomy. One is the girl

1198
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:42,280
in Wendy's. She's a 90 pounds, redhead with freckles. And the other one is Shaquille O'Neal,

1199
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:48,720
300 pound black guy. Okay. Okay. The amount of anesthesia that I have to administer to the Wendy's

1200
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,760
daughter, the red 90 pound redhead girl with freckles will kill Shaquille O'Neal. That doesn't

1201
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,280
make any sense because she's 90 pounds. He's 300 pounds. It means he takes three times plus,

1202
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,040
right? The amount that I would have to give the little tiny 90 pound white girl with red hair

1203
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,180
and freckles. I keep emphasizing red hair and freckles. Right. Right. We'll kill Shaquille

1204
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:13,240
O'Neal. Right. Right. So that's not because he's Shaquille O'Neal. And the other one is her dad

1205
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:20,260
has a hamburger company. No, it has to do with, with race big time. Also the reason why so many

1206
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:26,300
people in Korea, Japan and parts of China and Taiwan died with the Prozac and all these other

1207
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:32,560
tests. Now they might have Prozac now in Asia, but it's not the same chemical to administer to

1208
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,460
the Westerners. They call it Prozac or whatever. Right. Because all these names, if they look at

1209
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,880
the chemical name, they try to shorten it to see if it'll work in the pub. You know what I mean?

1210
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:48,740
Right. Right. So, uh, yeah, this goes, this is on, on and on and on and on, but it's disregarded

1211
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:54,140
again when they give, if anytime they have a one size fits all, it's a scam. And it's pretty

1212
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,540
obvious with the recent injection scheme that they had. But fortunately, I keep saying this,

1213
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,260
no humans got the shot. Fortunately. Anyway, what does he mean by that? What are the 50 million

1214
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:11,040
people in the U S got? Uh, well, I'm still sticking to it. They weren't, they weren't

1215
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,480
really people, but anyway. All right. Let's just call them Guinea pigs for now. Fair enough.

1216
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,680
Uh, no, I get it. It's just, I just found it remarkable that nobody bothered to take a moment

1217
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:27,060
and say, you know what, there might be a difference based on, uh, not, not just ethnicity, but

1218
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,800
cultural exposure to certain things. You know, if nobody in a culture eats a particular food,

1219
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,940
they might not ever get toxicity from said food. You know what I'm saying? If, if there are people

1220
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,400
that are, here's the thing right now is to anyone that comes from Asia, Europe, or the continent

1221
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:49,100
of Africa, people say Africa, like it's a country, right? Anyway, uh, when they come here to the

1222
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,480
States, the first thing they notice is, uh, well, the first comment they'll make,

1223
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,440
especially if they're sensitive, uh, you ask them about the food, they'll say,

1224
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:04,540
it tastes like everything has was poisoned. Right. Right. Think about it. Oh, I know that's

1225
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:09,560
a Testament. Hey, that's a Testament to the robustness of the human condition, the human

1226
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,040
body where we could take a, well, I'll leave you off with this Betty white comment. Uh, she's Greek

1227
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,280
too, by the way, was what a dummy man. She was telling her to get a vaccine. She got hers. She

1228
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,640
dies the next day. Right. Anyway, maybe a non-human Greek. So she says, everybody says, you know,

1229
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:34,460
balls are tough, but vaginas, man. Oh, they could take a pounding anyway. Fair enough. But I just,

1230
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,580
I just find it remarkable that there's always things that can be learned by observing the

1231
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:43,180
silliness of others when they, uh, when they get into it, it's racist to say that about, and I'm

1232
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:49,960
like, how is that in a way that it should be done? A racist is not a bad word, by the way,

1233
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,440
it just become a bad word, like anarchists and all this other stuff. It doesn't say anything.

1234
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:02,020
When you say you're racist, you know, the real races are man and woman, you know? So all men

1235
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:06,980
of any race, quote unquote, will be more similar than any women of any race within the race. Right.

1236
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,860
So if you separate, if you had a group of people, some people don't like calling people black or

1237
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:18,680
Negro or what a dark skin or African-American, whatever. Um, uh, they don't like that. And so

1238
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,580
just use the term that's accepted. If you take a white males, black males, Asian males, uh,

1239
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:30,180
native American ESCO, put them in one side, they'll get, and he'd take the same in women,

1240
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,640
black women, white women, Inuit, Asian women, put them on the other side. They will get along

1241
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:41,780
those two separate one mixed race, female group, one mixed race, male group. Those groups will get

1242
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:49,180
along better than if you had them all mixed together, male and female. That's a Carlos

1243
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,860
Castaneda thing I've picked up by. It's one thing that I, I liked where he says the rate,

1244
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,860
the real races are man and woman, male and female. That's the real race in two races

1245
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,080
and the most evident by the way. So there you go.
