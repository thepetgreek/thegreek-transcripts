1
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,400
Sonic event number four of Ocelli in the Greek rated Y and you know here's a

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,060
good why question I guess or maybe it's a why question maybe it's a why not

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,460
question. Greek, are things just fine the way they are anyway? I mean a lot of

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,140
people want to ascend, separate themselves, improve the quality of things

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,760
but maybe things are just fine the way they are. I'd say they are the way they

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
are because they're fine. How about that way? Okay. It's kind of it's kind of like

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,460
wash your brain instead of brainwashing. Mm-hmm. So you know all these things

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,820
turned around a little bit. I would say give a little cosmic history. What if

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,120
there is an overarching being in a society of beings whether it's social or

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,660
familial that control everything that we consider to be the universe, right? And

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,200
remember what we consider to be the universe you know scientists if you

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,600
follow them they they've told us the earth is aging at two and a half million

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,360
years per year which sounds bizarre you know and hundred years ago they said the

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,760
universe was a half a million years old and then in the 20s it was a million by

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,380
the 50s it was 500 million by the 80s it's billion now it's 15 billion so if

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,720
you divide it it's about two we're aging at about two and a half million years

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,920
per year it sounds kind of ridiculous but that's what they're telling us right?

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,360
Well and again does it really matter? Does it really matter? Because right you

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,680
know after all look you're only going to be here for this short period of time no

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,200
matter how you reckon it no matter how you lawfully count it or not there is a

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,100
finite amount of time that you're going to be in this experience seems like so

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,300
what is the point of even knowing the context of that experience I mean is it a

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,220
literal nanosecond are we talking about you know I mean look I guess that's

24
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,120
relevant because somebody might want to know what their contribution is their

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,860
context is in this experience but are things okay the way they are I mean as

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,340
strange as that might sound like I said yeah somebody wishes to seek a little

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,480
bit better quality I mean you and I've talked about it many times why not

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,520
improve the quality of the food the water the shelter the clothing while

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,020
you're here sure for yourself yes but what about the status quo I mean is it

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,040
not there for a reason so I don't know I leave it to you yeah well here's the

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,760
thing let's say it's an absolute that there are overarching beings more

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,320
powerful than us that have full control of everything we perceive as being the

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,180
universe and if you hearken back to religion aspects they say well the good

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,500
will be rewarded in the poor and the bad will be punished right well why would you

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,280
set it up that way unless you're a real sadist right to deliberately set people

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,360
up so you could torture them which is which actually happens by the way in this

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,860
society even though it's not well publicized it is known so what I'm

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,180
suggesting here is that there is a mechanism in place that no matter how

39
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,540
evil corrupt or bad the status quo is it's just fine and the reason why it's

40
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,380
just fine is because anything that is inefficient or quote-unquote bad or

41
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,340
contrary to any law whether it's natural law overall cosmic law or man's law or

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,520
the laws of any law contrary will not necessarily be punished directly but

43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,800
it'll just wear out like an engine that doesn't have enough oil and it's

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,500
overheating you're on your way to wherever you want to go it's been

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,820
reliable for five years but guess what right now it's going to give it up and

46
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,700
it's going to break down you see mm-hmm so the entropy will catch up yeah well

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,180
is that more of the natural order of things anyway or is that something that

48
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,779
is just look everything is meant to be finite see I brought up that idea

49
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,200
already where look everything has a lifespan so to speak everything has a

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,500
time period before its obsolescence becomes obvious and inevitable so the

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,340
system the construct the organizational principles all of these things are meant

52
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,980
to what fail at some point are they not both in other words there are two

53
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,740
natural systems the the real natural system and the one we called to be the

54
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,280
natural system that we lean on that's where the the issue of your perception

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,320
and your confidence comes in and I want to I want to wrestle with that for a

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,920
minute sure we did a let's say a little bit of an introduction to it on the last

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,440
one right we perceive certain things as knowledge or things we should know and

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,660
then once we grasp them or receive them as such we become confident in it

59
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,180
and then any information contrary you know cognitive dissonance or

60
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,700
argumentedness all this other stuff before we get into that I want to pull

61
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,640
up this I think this is like old philosophical stuff I'm just kind of

62
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,180
distilled it I want to read something real quick this is like in the vein of

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,860
the old philosophers of the 20th century the guys from the Carpathian Mountains

64
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,520
like Kripke and those guys so think about this for a moment because we I

65
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
mentioned you mentioned the status quo and I said it's basically corrupt and

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,340
evil it always has been if you go back to the times of ancient times as well

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
let's say within the five to six thousand year history that we're aware

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,140
of and it's not going to be punished directly as we see in the religiosity

69
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,440
and in the biblical mistranslations but it's just going to wear out and if you

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,940
understand in context for example it's just for a second talk about the

71
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,100
biblical context it's not punished directly because a lot of the concepts

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,380
of hell and all that don't exist right it might just be one word but we attach

73
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,900
it to what we see from the Vatican and from Hollywood what happens is it says

74
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,320
it's no more the same as your car that you've been relying on breaks down

75
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,500
because it didn't have any oil in it you didn't check you didn't maintain it

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,020
right so this is what's going to happen it's just a matter of being patient

77
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,860
watching it happen you know basically this universe will be or this society

78
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,300
will be left on the side of the road kind of thing so I want to go back to what

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,240
the philosophy this is a distilled philosophical thing about truth so if we

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,940
look at truth there are truths that are absolute independent of any individual

81
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,520
mind and therefore universal meaning if even if no one's heard of it it's still

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,100
true it's still the truth does it matter if you know about it or not let's say

83
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,320
purely objective then you have the concept of where you go into the way

84
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,920
that we have our human dynamic the way our minds work and I'm saying this very

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,800
strictly in a sense that if we really found out how our minds work you ready

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
for this we would know everything about the past the present and everything

87
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,100
about the future because they all exist at the same time just like the parade

88
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,040
exists and the person up in the helicopter can see the whole parade where

89
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,900
you're on the street right that analogy right okay so these next three concepts

90
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,800
are from what we consider to be the way our mind works now because again if we

91
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,520
knew everything let's just say about the future what would we think about our

92
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,000
knowledge base it would be infinite right so we don't have that so again when

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm going to mention these other aspects this is from as we stand right

94
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,460
now and when I say as we stand right now even an NPC one of these hollow husks of

95
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,060
a human is able to do this but there but their programming doesn't allow them to

96
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,480
okay okay so the first part about the conventional minds that we exercise now

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,680
let's say the concept of knowledge right orgnosis right it's possible with the

98
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,140
mindset that we have now is to gain objective knowledge of some of the truth

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,700
that we just mentioned earlier that is universal okay let's say not all of it

100
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,919
but some of it and I've gone over how we have infinite memory capability but I'm

101
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,580
keeping it in the sum so it is possible to gain objective knowledge of these

102
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,740
objective truths in the next one would be the reasoning behind it the reason is

103
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,020
the best way for reasoning is the best way to achieve and justify this

104
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,300
knowledge which is logic and reason again from the religious part you hear

105
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,460
the logos and they translate that as the word right and it's actually the word

106
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:13,640
logical or reasoning so by logic and reason you have to include the aspect of

107
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,940
time if you hear a new concept you might want to ask when you're initiated to

108
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,660
this concept how long has it been that way when did we first discover it you

109
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,760
see when you know when was this notion you know how did I miss out on it right

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,400
so the concept of time and history so one of the ways to bring up reason and

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,100
logic is to find out the history of the thing I think I've said this on vintage

112
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,220
Greek speak to know the history of the thing you know the thing I once was

113
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,400
around some very young twins very intelligent and they're always in front

114
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,500
of the TV and the parents didn't want me around anymore because I told them

115
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,620
don't let the TV raise your children and they took it as an affront but the

116
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,380
children asked me I basically said you know the TV is a recent invention they

117
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,700
didn't know that right so when they had the dinosaur book they thought the TV

118
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,000
might have been just after the dinosaurs right they have no idea until I let them

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,340
know about the history so this is part of logic and reason in other words you

120
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,340
can infer is a process that you could bring forward when you're bringing

121
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,800
forward an idea especially to the status quo as you said that you know might be

122
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,720
rejected but don't hold that don't be confident that it'll be rejected but you

123
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,280
the possibility is there like ninety percent in your statement include some

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,040
history historicity of it okay okay okay the next thing is the concept of

125
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,360
progress I don't like to use the word evolution but moving forward what would

126
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,060
be another word for progress evolving right or going to the next level yeah to

127
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,980
evolve makes sense but you know there is a difference between discovery and

128
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,380
existence right because that's something that just stuck with me when

129
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,460
you're talking about this just because it has not been discovered doesn't mean

130
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,900
it wasn't true but at the same time if it hasn't been communicated then it's

131
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,020
not part of the again it's not part of the status quo's base of knowledge it's

132
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,220
not part of anybody's base of knowledge even having been discovered so yeah but

133
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,540
even the discovery okay again we'll get into a little more the concept of the

134
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,440
atom is total bullshit right it's not a they say it's atomic I say it's a

135
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,240
compound because it's a combination of elements known as electrons protons and

136
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,360
neutrons in different orders so that we're still being lied to about

137
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,860
electrons and all that and what things we couldn't see let's say or we still

138
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,920
can't see but they well the virus thing it's all it's all artist animation right

139
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,200
right and people take it as hard so that's this is part of this car that

140
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,540
doesn't have enough oil is gonna burn up on the side of the road right you

141
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,220
just don't want to be a passenger in it spiritually well when it happens right

142
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,900
because you're gonna end up walking so when you are in a situation like that

143
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,180
make sure you got good walking shoes and some bus fare okay so the progress and

144
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,860
the evolution part is as you let's say the human mind as we consider it now can

145
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:26,260
improve progress evolve right move forward by using rational reasoning to

146
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,360
this objective knowledge but only to the objective knowledge in other words

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,640
the rational reasoning like let's say you're from again confronted with

148
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,420
something new get a little history in there either explain it or ask for it and

149
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:46,620
that will start to set up that reason and logic right okay in time but what we

150
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,060
see here in other words for humans to to better their position is to act

151
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,960
rationally in response of being confronted or made aware of this

152
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,640
objective knowledge that's the real scientific method let's say right and

153
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,600
all this but what's going on right now is it the knowledge is not objective

154
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,920
it's social right it's social acceptance confidence so I just want to bring up

155
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,440
those philosophical points because what I mean by philosophical meaning that if

156
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,320
you are really looking you know for the word what it means also philosophy you

157
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,800
have to distill things down where you take yourself out of it but can still use

158
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,860
it you know so taking your subjectiveness out now when we when I

159
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,620
brought up the concepts of the confidence you know the you ever heard of you fell

160
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,740
for a con man you know the con man is a negative thing right of course well the

161
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,100
con man is short for confidence right that's where it comes from so the so

162
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,740
somehow someone approached you with some information but their their deal was not

163
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,880
to give objective information their right their deal was to project a sense of

164
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,960
confidence and you latch on to that feeling and you take on some of what

165
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,560
they said because remember Gustav Le Bon the essence of the crowd is you cannot

166
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,580
give them direct information you simplify it and most of the time the

167
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,740
information because becomes so simplified that it no longer represents

168
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,580
the initial idea okay so that's where you have all these theories around

169
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,460
there's no conclusion people say what about this theory that there is it look

170
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,060
there's millions of theories out there when you start garnering conclusions for

171
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,780
these I'd like to know what the conclusions are and you never get that

172
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,820
right because it's all presumptive so back to the con man and I'm mentioning

173
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,740
the the the confidence and their perception the way that everything is

174
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,640
being steered here apparently is by con men in other words you become confident

175
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,280
in the method of their delivery and the contents are ignored right and when the

176
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,140
contents the actual objectifying of the content contents are brought up and are

177
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,260
at the point of being revealed the person becomes it becomes a personal

178
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,500
battle for them like for example they want to debate you and it's not what to

179
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,880
debate to bring forward anything of merit but it's so they can win the

180
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,320
debate so the whole thing goes away from the subject again just like when you're

181
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,440
dealing with the state and the legal stuff it'll you'll see like most people

182
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,540
in federal prison are in there with very obscure charges right like false

183
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,480
information or conspiracy right you know it's just like really obscure stuff you

184
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,780
see because the the definitions of the things that they did being applied in

185
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:35,640
their law is not being done so you have this concept of the confidence being

186
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,780
instilled in the being now we're not going to get into the different types of

187
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,320
humans here but just say overall society and accepted because of the

188
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,640
confidence now very often I'm not going to mention any names like cliff high or

189
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,360
other people like that but people say you gotta listen to this guy and I said

190
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,960
he's really smart Greek and I'm like okay well there's a big difference

191
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:03,100
between people who are smart and people who sound smart yes big difference

192
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,840
difference in fact yes right so he's a guy that sounds smart and he's a pure

193
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,420
materialist he's always talking about absorbing nutrients I'm like okay right

194
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,180
there right well you can be a little forgiving he just doesn't know but when

195
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,140
he hammers on this stuff like whatever you know schizophrenia is genetic right

196
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,500
and all this other stuff I'm like okay I've these like five people have

197
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,920
recommended him to me in a year and I might I give the same answer because I

198
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,960
go back and check maybe the guy has turned around and evolved and he hasn't

199
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,220
and there's many people like that the Jason Breshears guy is another example

200
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,740
of someone who is extremely confident and when he brings up stuff not

201
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,060
everything most a lot of the stuff he brings up is valid not all of it he's so

202
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,460
confident that the people just grab onto it because he's

203
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,460
confident right okay and you could prove this by looking at the cliff high in the

204
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,140
in the archaic comments you'll see all these comments and what are the comments

205
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:07,220
oh I love you Jason great work oh this is so great oh he's a burning hunk of

206
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:15,380
love oh but it's like wow wow talk about like disposable mindset right so so this

207
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,800
confidence thing has not necessarily ruined society because it's always been

208
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,859
around since ancient times it is a factor so what's going to happen is if

209
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,040
you have listened to Greek speak or anything like that

210
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,980
haha saying that sarcastically if you've listened to Greek speak let's say

211
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,440
which I believe stands alone and you start approaching people in your

212
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,640
proximity regardless of relation you will meet 90% of the time you will meet

213
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,960
friction some some sort of disbelief there's a variety of responses right

214
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,400
right now I have a question about this okay because here is the difficulty for

215
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,920
me personally I'm gonna go personal because I can I can explain this pretty

216
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,740
well and maybe you can help me because I guarantee I'm not alone what I find the

217
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,540
problem to be is that establishing a communication with somebody where you

218
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,040
have look we can accept this both you and I accept a particular concept an

219
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,820
idea a truth if you will let us begin there right I had a problem recently

220
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,600
with this whole thing why are you against you know the vaccination wrote

221
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,580
it up okay well I said look let's establish that this is what is written

222
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,960
by the drug company who made it right couldn't even get somebody to agree to

223
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,860
that even though I can demonstrate it I can give him a copy of it I can show him

224
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,560
they can go get their own I couldn't even get him to do that because there is

225
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,740
this refusal to share right to objectively observe this is something

226
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,820
that's written in that document I'm not saying it's true or not I'm simply

227
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,620
saying this is what we can both observe let's begin from that point there is

228
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,140
difficulty lately it seems to me in getting anybody to do that whether it's

229
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,280
about politics or it's about a situation whatever where it's like look

230
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,780
go outside look up at the sky tell me that what you see is it not the same

231
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,460
thing I see and you can't get an agreement there even to begin with right

232
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,340
so everything skews off from that and becomes a problem with communication

233
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,700
because you can't objectively establish things like this so problems with trying

234
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,660
to explain you know like like you're talking about very much in these

235
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,540
previous sonics this concept of look if you take a look at a tire you know you

236
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,220
dissect it you do a cross-section you look at it you have this you know

237
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,680
enclosed thing now you take a look at the human body it does that too where we

238
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,840
have an enclosure okay there's no absorption again you try and do that

239
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,080
they absolutely refuse to even do the objective look to say oh but it would

240
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,080
be it would be this yeah it would be the same as the VAX or the body or this or

241
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,800
the chemtrail or this or that or that because it's not the subject matter well

242
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,080
but there it is but you can't even establish the objective right because

243
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:37,160
yes okay let's get into a more and we'll see how we can well my experiences but

244
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,560
you know we're gonna view each thing from our own our own container yeah fine

245
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,500
of course but I just wanted to get into this because I think this is a common

246
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,920
issue where oh yeah you can't we will we will as we started in other words we've

247
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,960
already gotten into it I think you jump forward which is fine because this is

248
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,100
the you know in other words don't give me the history like it's like if I ask

249
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,720
you what time it is don't tell me how to build a watch right right I'm just asking

250
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,840
you what time it is basically the whole thing is it's all personal okay so you

251
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,000
know like for example the VAX is an easy one and depending on who you're

252
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,500
speaking to you have to be able to switch really quickly right you know so

253
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,920
like an old person who can't hear a guy works on Wall Street or four-year-old

254
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,760
baby if you're gonna address them at the same time your message is about 20%

255
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,160
clear but if you address each one of them you're gonna have to speak real loud

256
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,960
to the guy who can't hear the Wall Street guy and the four-year-old a

257
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,740
little different okay so you have to be able to do that quickly make these

258
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,340
adjustments but that's a personal thing but what I'm saying is it's all personal

259
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,280
in other words the reason I read that philosophical stuff there is because

260
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,960
that is something that you could write in stone as a marker and a reference on

261
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,420
how someone with a mind any mind can operate but what I'm saying is the

262
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,300
concept of the con man and the confidence has nothing to do with the

263
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,220
information that they're caught they're supposedly confident that they're

264
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,000
confident that if they say this that are accepted in whatever group or even

265
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,180
personally if you'll personally stable so let's do the Vax very very simple

266
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,660
like for example someone who was logical and I said I you understand there's

267
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,300
something called logic or whatever you know they'll be like yeah I said you

268
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,480
know because they called me a Vax denier right and I said well in logic you

269
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,980
cannot deny something that doesn't exist you can only deny something that

270
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,580
exists so because vaccines don't exist as they're advertised I'm not denying

271
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,460
Vax vaccines because they don't exist there's no such thing as a vaccine if

272
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:47,520
you call it inoculation right if you call it an injection well the injection

273
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,080
exists but an injection as a vaccine does not exist you see right that's why

274
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,060
I often call it a medication because I think it is a medication it is an

275
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,400
injection in a strictest term it is yeah but but you shouldn't have to what

276
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,900
okay we just established they are actually telling you that you have to

277
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,860
put it under the skin subdermal intravenously somehow because nothing

278
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,360
gets through the body is that interesting right okay maybe by the time

279
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,680
we're in with the sonic I'm going to throw out some more stuff about what what

280
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,740
the body is doing but this is all personal for example if you speak to

281
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,500
someone about chemtrails and they say that's conspiracy theory stuff you type

282
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,720
in chemtrails in a browser on a search the first thing that comes up is it's

283
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,580
conspiracy theory stuff right but if you type in a search stratospheric aerosol

284
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,260
injection what do you get all these patents and methods and companies

285
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,540
offering it for a fee same stuff because when you go to images for the chemtrails

286
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,520
that are all marked as conspiracy stuff you see the images and you go to

287
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,560
stratospheric aerosol injection you have the same images how is that possible or

288
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,860
similar right that's not conspiracy theory so the legal aspect of the words

289
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,500
changing makes a big difference so when you're approaching someone with this

290
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:17,600
information I would suggest trying that the methodology of pure reason and even

291
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,920
a dopey child has pure reason we would be like you can't watch any TV unless

292
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,380
you do your homework well that's reason and logic in other words in logic well I

293
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,240
have to do homework first and then TV comes second because if homework becomes

294
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,340
zero TV becomes zero you see the logic even a little child right so that basic

295
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,880
childlike essence works in the logic you know nothing that includes more than one

296
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,580
or two concepts at a time so when you provide this knowledge base whether it's

297
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,560
the thing you brought up the vaccine maybe the sky stuff I think when you

298
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,500
said sky you didn't say chemtrails I'm saying chemtrails right right okay but

299
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,020
I've done this before people look up and they just don't know if they if here's

300
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,020
one of the things that is interesting you know how I've always said the opposite

301
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,260
of love is not hate it's apathy right because it's the same amount of passion

302
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:16,140
to love and to hate apathy removal of any passion removal of energy okay when

303
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,340
you when I was out in the parking lot years ago and I point up what are those

304
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,940
clouds right half the people didn't even bother looking they were completely

305
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,560
apathetic they didn't even want to look up or acknowledge even the kind of glance

306
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,580
that I was pointing up and they didn't even engage me at all zero right and the

307
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,260
ones that did engage me said well there's no way that the government would

308
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,080
allow that right there's no way that you know how come you're the only person

309
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,260
that's ever told me this right or all this plausible tonight it's very

310
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,900
personal right and one person so yeah I know they're chemtrails go online and I

311
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,060
said yeah I know if they're online thanks man right okay so there is the

312
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,760
best thing you can experience with this by the way is apathy so when you bring

313
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,000
up the vaccine to someone or they do and they don't want to engage you at all on

314
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,480
it I know the opposite of love is not what we're here for right we're here for

315
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,760
love it's it's apathy and when you get that apathy it's the op you feel that

316
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,800
sinking feeling I've just been ignored right but I'm telling you would you

317
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,280
rather invest a whole bunch of you know energy and you know when it's not going

318
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,960
to go anywhere as people do most of the time personally I have much success with

319
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,980
all types and the reason why is because I understand that they know jack shit

320
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,040
about anything right and I'm not talking about that you know how it

321
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,240
pretty much say it's a society of morons and most people think yes of course

322
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,580
because I go out in the street and I see how the population is I'm not when I say

323
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,360
that I'm not talking about the general population I'm talking about the

324
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,480
professionals the people the specialists I don't even consider the general

325
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,320
population at all in my in my dialogue very very rarely so when I say society of

326
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,800
morons means your doctors your lawyers your judges your rabbis your imams your

327
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,820
engineers that's who the more you right the rest don't count at all so when I

328
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,160
say that people don't know jack shit in other words I'm talking to about like

329
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,800
you mentioned the human body right just now that the look at the car tire in

330
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,600
this time what I have a car when I bring up an example of a conversation on that

331
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,780
it's never with someone in the population and I stated it's with a

332
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,540
medical person someone who's trained with a doctorate degree in medicine or

333
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,960
whatever biology right so when I bring up energy systems and I talked to

334
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,320
someone it's because I'm spoken speaking to a physicist or an engineer not

335
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,680
because some common person on the street now I do have some examples where yes

336
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,700
you know but being out in the parking lot of Home Depot and pointing up right

337
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,940
most people ignore but when I bring up a specific topic especially with the legal

338
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,540
when I say they don't know the law it's I'm specifically talking about attorneys

339
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,920
does this make it worse yes it makes the situation that humans are in much worse

340
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,580
because most people would say well if he's talking about everyone's a moron is

341
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,640
talking about the population not my uncle who or my dad who was an attorney

342
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,860
and my mom who was a doctor no way right I'm talking about them though okay so

343
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,480
what that does it does two things one thing I've stated before is all fields

344
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,720
are wide open because the professionals and those that are leading you the

345
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,080
educators and authorities or whatever are idiotic and moronic what does that

346
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,740
mean you're not going to get anything logical and reasonable reasonable or even

347
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,780
true from them so what does that mean okay well it means you're in piss poor

348
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,000
shape right you're looking up and you're giving them lots of quote-unquote

349
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,760
credits to get basically very little or next to nothing or false stuff okay

350
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,600
that's the negative part the positive part is this and I've always said this

351
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,700
and I've never really gotten much feedback on it this is the positive side

352
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,000
of these professionals being morons what that what it does is these professionals

353
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,720
are supposedly masters of individual fields okay specific fields if they're

354
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,800
all moronic as a general whole a few exception the positive side is that it

355
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:10,740
leaves all those fields of study wide open leaves them wide open for you to

356
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,780
progress with it you see so for example when we do the medical thing you look at

357
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,380
the car tire the structure is designed to be completely enclosed and sealed from

358
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,360
the outer environment all right same with the human body when you develop a

359
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,540
science on that let's say we were the first humans and we just became

360
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,620
conscious we build our science on that right we'll be very advanced in a very

361
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,620
short period of time not just alone but you need a collective of people to be

362
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:45,180
working on it right and what will happen is the choice of this matter versus the

363
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,460
choice of the matter of going with the established medicine you don't have to

364
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,760
go you don't have to see them as competition at all like the horse race

365
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,260
you just run it like a horse race you ever see the Hort people racing on a

366
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,440
horse track are they looking at the guy next to him say hey how did you get

367
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,440
ahead of me or right never they're always looking straight ahead even the

368
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,760
guy in last place is whipping his horse just as much as the guy in first place

369
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,060
you ever noticed that yes okay in a horse race you don't care what the guy

370
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,040
you're not really it's you and the horse to get to the line regardless of what

371
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,000
position you're in the same with let's say the field of medical study if

372
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,640
enough people come together and we start developing a knowledge base and a

373
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,900
practice meaning practice as in practical application don't even consider

374
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,720
the existing medical community what will happen the word will get out and you'll

375
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,940
start and then it'll the choice will be obvious right it'll be obvious you don't

376
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,240
have to say we're going against these guys or bad-mouthing these guys right

377
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,340
because again you go on the alternative media whatever you'll find all these

378
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,000
people and videos or whatever bad-mouthing the current establishment

379
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,600
but do they know really how the body works no no right so that's not

380
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,320
necessary everything is like that completely even history and studying of

381
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,380
ancient texts okay so when you're getting into a relationship regarding

382
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,140
exchange of information it is not that at all I don't know how else I could

383
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,900
drive that home it is personal how many times do you hear people have a

384
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,040
conversation don't take this personal I can only take it personal what's

385
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:28,260
important is in my person in my mind do I have the subdivision that when we're

386
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,340
speaking about knowledge truth logic and reason to come to an objective truth

387
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,960
a real truth I need to keep myself down you know I can't be angry I can't be

388
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,720
jealous I can't be too excited right I can't be defensive you see we talked

389
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,060
about the lack of emotion right with the Vulcans not necessarily to that point

390
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,660
but setting all of the things outside all the negative attributes that we hear

391
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,260
con men instilling in people see because the con man is totally cool he's like a

392
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,740
con man or like mr. Magoo remember the cartoon he walks through all these

393
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,460
things where he should be killed hit by a car you know something piano dropping

394
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,020
but he always evades it right yeah seemingly oblivious but continues yeah

395
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,900
of course and that's right so yeah a good con man would be oblivious to the

396
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,080
con right well oblivious to the con and oblivious to anything that contradicts it

397
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,000
or impedes it and just simply navigates mm-hmm without it out yeah mm-hmm so

398
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,920
here's the the thing because this has been coming up often well for more than

399
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,100
about two decades now I've been doing Greek speak I started doing public

400
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:45,400
speaking here in Tucson around 2004 it comes up often oh my wife doesn't want

401
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,060
to hear my husband's want to hear my children think I'm crazy the I'd lost my

402
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,560
job is it well you're not doing it right obviously in other words if that's the

403
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,500
outcome you want you're doing it right right well here's one way that that I

404
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,700
project it for example I know that the they're already going to be they it when

405
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,720
you're dealing with the masses or even the professionals most likely the

406
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,040
professionals that is I have I approach on these subjects at length for example

407
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:21,420
at length could be 30 seconds to three minutes okay what I do is I bring in some

408
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:29,620
historicity first you know I remind them of the the medical society that they're

409
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:36,700
in how old it is right I remind them that we're somehow don't have any money

410
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,640
to pay for anything there's many ways to do that right so people say why is the

411
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,700
medical you know how can when you're using fiat currency how are you going to

412
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,580
get real education with fiat currency it has to be fiat education you know right

413
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,040
just make it so all right the other thing I remind them is that we are in a

414
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,740
temporal local temporal geographic zone known as the earth however whether you

415
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,560
think it's round and a ball or flat and round or whatever it doesn't matter so

416
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,139
what I do is I inject enough sarcasm in a British humor kind of way which it's

417
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,860
accepted if you I think most people have been exposed to it right where I inject

418
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,860
a level of sarcasm where you're not sure if it's supposed to be funny and make

419
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:31,840
them laugh but it usually does right and one of those things is anybody who's

420
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,780
just came who's been on earth for more than 15 minutes has figured this out now

421
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,860
they that gets into their mind like what do you mean you've only need to be on

422
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,760
this planet for 15 minutes to figure out what he's saying what what what I'm I

423
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,020
missed out on something right this for a third of a second that's what goes

424
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,060
through their mind but then the other two-thirds of the second it's like oh is

425
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,580
he trying to be funny and sarcastic oh okay so he's not really challenging me

426
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:05,120
because we tell someone a joke by the way you're including them into a social

427
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,720
event whether you're on stage speaking to a hundred people are telling your one

428
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,460
person a joke you're not the joke is not really there's a difference in laughing

429
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,840
with them or at them but either way a joke is a friendly kind of amicable way

430
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:25,500
to relate you must bring humor you into the situation right right how many times

431
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,320
have you heard it was really bad but we all left smiling okay so I've noticed

432
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,340
very often a quote-unquote truthers in person or online when they go out in the

433
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,460
street or even interviews or whatever they have their demeanor changes and they

434
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,540
become very stoic and very almost affrontive with before they even start

435
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:51,700
speaking so I would suggest that bringing in satire humor even some

436
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,720
sarcasm is the way to do it the way I do it is not the way that others would do

437
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,900
it and by the way I always tell people don't do what I would do right and it's

438
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,800
not because you shouldn't do what I'm doing it's just that if you're gonna do

439
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,120
anything or say anything that I'm saying make sure that you have your own you

440
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,840
know I've give everyone license right if people go out and speak and say things

441
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,260
verbatim but they don't have to say they got it from the Greek I'm just glad

442
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:23,080
it's getting out there now but when it softens it softens things to with a joke

443
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,300
you sort of you relax people right when you're doing a presentation it's a very

444
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,460
common thing to do it doesn't matter what the presentation is about actually

445
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,280
if you bring them in on a joke kind of relaxes the audience a bit whether it's

446
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,760
an audience of one or a hundred like you said so yeah commonly yes yeah so all

447
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,500
this communication believe it or not okay the the crux of this the subject

448
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,800
matter on the sonic so far has been what happens when you talk you know do

449
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,200
greek-speak with other people they you know right 90% of time they okay so it's

450
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,000
not just greek-speak when you're having any cop any communication or interaction

451
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,860
with people it's about them from their point of view as they see themselves as

452
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,580
they think you see them also right and then there's the way that everyone sees

453
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,940
them you know what social group are you Democrat Republican are you black white

454
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,040
right all that other stuff so they're very very concerned on a personal level

455
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,260
of what's going on again if all of this information let's go back to the Vax

456
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,740
thing you know it's all calm right okay it's actually by the way let's just

457
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,480
just scratch the last five seconds of what I said if you keep watching the

458
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,680
media whether it's mainstream or alternative you're going to see from now

459
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,220
actually it started already so the next year it'll be parallel to the weapons of

460
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,420
mass destruction thing there's no weapons of mass destruction here right

461
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,360
right so right they told everyone that was the reason for and they themselves

462
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,960
admitted it was not okay so why go through all of that when it's already

463
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,860
very well established that there's no such thing as a vaccine by the way if you

464
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,840
go and look at newspapers from the 1800s they were very much against vaccines

465
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,820
they were killing people by the droves then also so there you know it's one of

466
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,980
these medical fictions okay so if you look at something like the even the Vax

467
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,740
or whatever the humor that you can bring on that is there's a multitude of humor

468
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,340
that you could bring into that the other thing is if you know for example and

469
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,400
here's the thing that I that I charge people with you must learn a lot you

470
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,320
must know a lot you must have a good memory and also good communication

471
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,380
skills otherwise just go be like everyone else okay right it's not much

472
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,280
hard it's not difficult to do but if you can't communicate it and it seems like a

473
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,520
personal front it's it's not going to work when you communicate with people so

474
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,860
you must know so for example I'll give an example again with the Vax at the

475
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,380
height of this someone there I went into a shop and I wasn't wearing a face

476
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,700
diaper and he offered me one and I said I don't know if this is isn't going to

477
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,920
work if this is going to work for me because I don't have an immune system

478
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,280
am I lying no one has an immune system right they call you know this this this

479
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,120
biological function of the body's ability to wipe up the quote-unquote bad

480
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,740
cells or dead cells and get rid of them right and protect the body from them

481
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,200
that lingering they call that an immune system but it's not an immune system

482
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,540
what's the organ for the immune system there is none what that is it's the

483
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,040
elimination system the eliminative system right right right so if you

484
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,160
understand that it's a medical fiction it's just a term right if I say there's

485
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,740
no such I don't have an immune system am I it's a hundred percent true based on

486
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,300
the knowledge base that I have but to them they've heard of the boy in the

487
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:00,020
plastic bubble remember that oh yeah yeah yeah you didn't have well you didn't

488
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,380
have an immune system so they have to be shielded they live their whole life

489
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,100
in a in a sterile chamber right and why is he in a sterile chamber because he

490
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,820
doesn't have an immune system as if it really existed so they they pick up

491
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,920
somewhere that it is possible for someone not to have an immune system

492
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,600
right right so this corrupt world in these common are actually telling you

493
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,840
the truth but they're not saying it applies to everyone just John Travolta in

494
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,020
the set right okay so now this guy thinks without me saying it that I'm

495
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,000
John the guy at the boy in the plastic bubble it happens to be walking into

496
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Sprouts market holy shit I'm privileged you know I'm a special needs person

497
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,220
suddenly right here's somebody who's so damaged that you're lacking this thing

498
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,300
which is commonly supposed to be with everybody right and he doesn't know that

499
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,760
he doesn't have one either but he's been conned into thinking that he does right

500
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,640
correct think about that for a minute okay so now what are you doing you know

501
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,100
he this guy's serious as a heart attack the store assistant manager he's

502
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:07,140
walking me through play I don't have the mascot right right okay so he clears the

503
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,060
aisle because I'm coming down people messes get out I want to come you want

504
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,580
to go down this aisle make sure he clears the whole aisle for me shit man

505
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:20,180
I'm like Ivanka Trump right I mean think of a celebrity going to supermarket

506
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:26,000
clear the aisle for him and I'm walking around and now here's the thing what he's

507
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,140
picking up on from my intuitively just like a you know if you have somewhat two

508
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,280
people approach a dog and one was a dog lover and the other ones afraid of dogs

509
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,040
neither of them say anything which one is the dog in a bite the one that's

510
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,140
afraid yeah he didn't say anything to do anything to the dog no the dog picks up

511
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,840
on it right exactly what's happening here I don't

512
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,340
have an immune system this guy is overly sympathetic he didn't have to do

513
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:01,120
that I am full of internally I am full of humor and honesty right now I'm not

514
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,360
assessing well this guy's poor SAP doesn't know it no you know you put me on

515
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,640
a lie detector test or whatever telepath you know scanned my brain right I'd be

516
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,420
telling the truth I have no immune system so he's picked up on that from

517
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,540
that I have a good good energy emanating from me and he got overly

518
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,680
sympathetic on his cause on his end based on he's confident that he heard

519
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,640
that people that are immune without an immune system are so special they

520
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,100
actually got John Travolta to play one okay right so what happened now is I

521
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,320
became privileged okay instead of what I'm not wearing that master's fire

522
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,480
whatever whatever what do you think would happen to that guy that guy gets

523
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,080
argued with we got you got to leave I'm gonna call the cops blah blah yeah yeah

524
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,660
okay so the when you put out this it just like the dog right the person

525
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,120
afraid of dog gets bit even though he hasn't done anything the dog picks up on

526
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,300
it I mean we're more evolved supposedly higher order than a dog let's say not to

527
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:08,720
put down dogs how much more do we do that so there's this essence of it also

528
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
so in essence if you start learning and this is the thing I charge people I

529
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,260
charge means you should do this you have to do it it's not a matter of choice so

530
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,160
you have to integrate it in your life is to study right and learn about things

531
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,640
using logic and reason anything that's new that you come about any information

532
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,700
that is new regardless when did it come into existence when did people find out

533
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,320
about what's the history you must know the history of it and guess what how

534
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,920
many people out there that are Provax know the history of vaccines next to

535
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,580
none next to not I know anything about anything right and and we're talking

536
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:54,240
about the medical community now okay so once you attach okay an easy way to do

537
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,520
it is if you're learning how to ride a bike the easiest way to learn how to

538
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,440
ride a bike pretty much if you don't have training wheels is to have both of

539
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,460
your feet not on the ground and you're not pedaling but you're coasting okay so

540
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,100
way of learning how to coast and I'm talking about this is all about

541
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:16,060
interacting with others on let's say Greek speak is stick to the history of a

542
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,520
thing and believe it or not those that have made the world so corrupt and evil

543
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,860
and bad and put out the con men and the cons that the population follows which

544
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,740
is false guess what those are publishing companies information societies you know

545
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,640
digital or whatever University libraries those are the same people that put out

546
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,520
the truth of the matter aren't they mm-hmm true mm-hmm right like for

547
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,180
example you do your JFK research how much valuable information can you get if

548
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:52,240
you looked at CIA files a lot right a lot yes even though people resist it and

549
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,900
say well you know look they're only gonna put out lies there I'm like no you

550
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,540
don't understand this then right because it's not that that's not the case at all

551
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,840
especially when you find something that's a report and it's actually dated

552
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,100
before the event happened right that's even better when you look at it and

553
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,200
that's the other thing is the timing of the thing is just as important as the

554
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,000
information in it because you can see when it came into existence versus when

555
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,540
a real-world event was supposed to be occurring and this is very important

556
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,680
yes well the FAA report on the flight path of the planes that supposedly hit

557
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,020
the World Trade Center that took off around 8 ish in the morning well that

558
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,000
entire flight plan was constructed and compiled at 530 in the morning of that

559
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,760
day three hours before they took off yeah wait a second okay I mean right but

560
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,220
it doesn't matter because from on a personal that information now becomes

561
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,240
personal I chose to believe that so if you want to challenge their information

562
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,840
which I know nothing about or care to you're challenging me and I will

563
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,140
challenge you to debate and I'm gonna make sure I win the debate information

564
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:04,300
doesn't mean anything okay so this is okay let's go back to the dog if you're

565
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,460
thinking like the person who is afraid of dogs the dogs gonna bite right and if

566
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:15,940
you're a dog lover dogs not gonna bite okay so the same way when you start

567
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,040
people start engaging with you or anyone that is bringing information forward and

568
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,680
you see it's going to go south it's believe it or not you what is it there

569
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,520
is no second chance to a first impression is there right so if they're

570
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,060
going south with the argument or it's going south and emotional and the

571
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,680
information doesn't matter it's just going into ad hominem stuff now like

572
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,300
you're a nutcase or whatever you were your shoes are dirty or whatever or okay

573
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,200
if it goes into that it's because of that first impression and you usually

574
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,480
don't have a second chance at that you can't recover on that so this is why

575
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,100
maybe I was I said let's do this sonic because I've got to get this out there

576
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,700
because I feel it you know in the ether that there's this is something that's

577
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:09,720
been coming up for a long time so what I've mixed here isn't is I did not get

578
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,640
in earlier in the first impression how important it is but this is a mixed bag

579
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,040
nothing that we're saying in the sonic should be done in any order you just

580
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,640
take it how you want but it's really that first impression again the dog

581
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,600
meeting someone who's afraid of dogs first impression if that person says in

582
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,340
their mind I love you doggy that's not gonna work okay if someone says don't be

583
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:35,320
afraid of dogs he's fine it's too late dog already got it okay so this is a

584
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:42,640
part of preparation of going out into the world I mean even if you're you smoke

585
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,600
a joint before when you wake up in the morning before your feet even touch the

586
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,080
ground out of bed you can still do what I'm saying it your state of mind is

587
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,900
your personal state of mind your personal habits are not as important as

588
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,360
the way that you organize the things that I'm saying that makes any sense well

589
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,040
I'm thinking that what's really important is what you project as opposed

590
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:14,360
to what the actual argument is because by projecting honesty and humor even

591
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,420
though you're not articulating that you change the circumstances

592
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,400
automatically you change the way the whole interaction goes that's what I'm

593
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,460
picking up on but I mean maybe I'm yeah well if you meditate think about the

594
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,460
higher order of things you ever see people that are go to war like in the

595
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,820
crusades right and it's because of their religion no matter what they do and no

596
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,200
matter how good the situation goes for them or how bad and they become let's say

597
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,920
martyred it doesn't diminish the cause you know how they feel about their

598
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,520
religion so they're asking God to protect them and they get slaughtered by

599
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,980
all the Muslims even when they're dying breath are still giving God thanks right

600
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:01,600
it's not dependent on if the situation goes well or poorly they are so deeply

601
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,600
entrenched in their quote-unquote faith so that's why I brought up is there

602
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,500
anything higher than an absolute truth even if independent of the individual

603
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,470
mind nothing there is nothing cannot be anything higher than that right so and

604
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,200
and the the highest individuals will try to get that knowledge you probably won't

605
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,620
get all of it but at least start by bit by bit bite by bite or chunks it right

606
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:34,000
and the way you get that knowledge is by reason and logic and the easiest way to

607
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,560
start reasoning it is how long has this been going on when did this come into

608
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,220
existence right and and by the way it's forever is not an acceptable answer

609
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,860
always is not an acceptable answer it should be accepted you know even in

610
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,860
mathematics when you're doing calculus square root of negative to know that you

611
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,040
do have the infinity you do use infinity right to send things to that end of the

612
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,220
line but it's not really fully acceptable but it's it's good enough so

613
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,340
within this and then also how are we going to get better and progress if we

614
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,920
don't have this objective knowledge that we've gotten through logic and

615
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,760
reason not from a con man right because a con man if he's giving you objective

616
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:23,520
truth and knowledge is he really a con man no no not at all confidence is not a

617
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:29,440
requisite for something to be true even if you don't believe it it does not mean

618
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,720
that it's necessarily untrue right but on the other side if you're giving

619
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,240
objective knowledge and also imbuing it with a confident tone of confidence now

620
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,900
you're more like the the dog lover that approaches the dog the dog will will be

621
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:53,340
great in your company right okay so are you confident in the knowledge

622
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:58,020
information that you're giving or yourself actually more in the information

623
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,680
take yourself out of it and this is what you learn from the religious zealots by

624
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,300
the way like the guys at the crusades you see it in the movies they all get

625
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:17,240
slaughtered but they're still thanking God right right so excellent well what

626
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,400
is it that we could do from here with this well okay I guess I guess I'm going

627
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,460
to ask you to repeat something here because all right we've talked about the

628
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:34,220
objective truth the highest truth the absolute truth and how this is relevant

629
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,260
and how it is presented but presentation is very important because even if you

630
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:46,180
have the absolute truth in hand if you cannot adequately communicate it it it's

631
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,480
not it's not really relevant it doesn't get communicated so it doesn't do

632
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,900
anything other than exist right so where are we at with this when you're

633
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:02,380
presenting easy good yeah easy easy on that so you figure out that something

634
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,840
works here the real scientific method it works for you it works over there

635
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,960
works in China works in Antarctica works for everywhere okay that's the real

636
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,800
scientific method it's repeatable right okay so no pun intended but if something

637
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,900
is repeatable it means that there was some form of communication even if the

638
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,880
people are local but typically you would communicate it in the letter on Skype or

639
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,320
you know somehow you know write a book and the person buys it on the other side

640
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:32,600
of the world it's all communication okay once that communication is successful

641
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,480
and the people report back by communication that there's consistency

642
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,560
now you have a group you have more than one person that could work and when you

643
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,320
have more than one person that could work on something you get what's called

644
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,540
development by the way in the business world when you hear development it means

645
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:57,800
raising money okay yeah so or wherewithal okay so once you get to that

646
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,460
point where you have people working on something let's not even call it a new

647
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,620
way of doing things because for example back to the medical once you get enough

648
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:11,160
people that figure out that nothing that the body works by induction nothing

649
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,740
passes through directly you have enough people working on that and you start

650
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,680
putting out you know your own version of bandage your own tonics your own

651
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:26,480
whatever you know devices and methods you don't have to accept you don't have

652
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,280
to accept the other system at all it doesn't even exist you you don't go

653
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,060
after it with hate and animosity the existing system you use apathy you don't

654
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:42,200
exist like look who's talking right now I in the real world you're gonna they're

655
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,400
gonna get the the attorneys after you right and I'll give you an example

656
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:51,900
recently I messaged someone about but someone wanted to buy a product I said

657
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,140
oh that's Illuminati stuff and I say I can't just say that's Illuminati stuff I

658
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,800
have to explain right so you have these products that come out like Bose

659
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,300
speakers right right everybody gets it right that's that's not an organic system

660
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,380
in other words that's not real free marketing the other one would be Dyson

661
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,240
vacuum cleaners you know if the vacuum cleaner was a dead market for I don't

662
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,020
know my whole life and then Dyson comes along suddenly Dyson vacuum cleaners are

663
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,200
exciting again right what he's like the only one right so you got all these

664
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,160
products and he got the Couric the little little coffee grinder cup that

665
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,160
the shirts shoot shoot steam through right right by these little things ends

666
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,160
up being like three dollars right for a little thing right anyway okay so what I

667
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,780
want to say about that people got the point when I brought up these companies

668
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:42,440
or organizations I have first-hand it well second-hand experience first-hand

669
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,540
experience knowing someone he wanted to start a particular business that was

670
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,800
part of a very large market and it looked like he went and got a patent all

671
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,380
this other thing and he had some you know he got his family money together

672
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,580
almost a million bucks and they started working right on this right and

673
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:03,780
advertising and that really good stuff all right what happens the bankers send

674
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,460
their middlemen the IRS after him audit after audit after audit after audit they

675
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,420
send the EPA because he had a gum wrapper on the floor that had some toxic

676
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,980
soy ink on it okay okay so you got the IRS you got the EPA then he gets the

677
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,840
building department the outlets should be at 42 at the switches should be 42

678
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,920
inches from the floor yours are 41 and 3 quarters inch it's out of code I'm

679
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
shutting down the place you get the point here mm-hmm you see where I'm

680
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:39,120
going with this okay so these guys Bose Dyson Keurig all these other things you

681
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,220
know you think they tell you look at the story with these wealthy people right

682
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,360
don't know bill pick pick your lot right you hear of them Soros Bill Gates

683
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,900
both bozos of Amazon right whatever yeah yeah okay so they give you their story

684
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,620
at least you always started off blah blah blah they're selling lemonade and

685
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,060
then move to this number if you follow the story doesn't make any sense it

686
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,420
doesn't do you think these people are set up and put forward you know I

687
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,440
personally have been around very wealthy people and I asked in their history and

688
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,960
they just shrug their shoulders they say honestly you know I know I know what

689
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,240
I've done I got I went to art school got into commodities and now you know I

690
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,560
control 70% of the helium in America which is actually 80% of the helium in

691
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,360
the world billionaire so I really don't know how it happened

692
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,340
Elon Musk to you know his story is weird oh my gosh yeah so all of this is

693
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:33,520
predetermined and pre put out and the easiest one to see that is glaringly out

694
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,480
there that most people miss is the vacuum cleaner guy I mean come on right

695
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,920
you got more play on vacuum cleaners than like new movie trailers that were

696
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:48,340
coming out so it's not natural guys it's not you know so this aspect yes you do

697
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,840
live in a controlled environment and that mechanism that apparatus that

698
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,280
structure that puts these guys with that makes vacuum cleaners more exciting than

699
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,320
whatever these guys will come after you so you have to be prepared but here's

700
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:09,580
the thing if the timing is right it won't it won't be as bad it'll still be

701
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,580
pretty bad how many times have you heard of people being you know things that are

702
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,380
accepted in society today but the inventors were like pretty much hung

703
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,260
from a lamppost for doing it right but now it's accepted so this is the part so

704
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:26,880
let's say you develop a medical system around that the body is a sealed

705
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,900
biological vacuum it's slightly minus pressure than the exterior environment

706
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,840
regardless of the creature whether it's a plant bird animal insect or whatever

707
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,980
human once you start moving forward there's going to be a lot of casualties

708
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:47,660
right so but maybe the purpose of saying this at least you don't you don't want to

709
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,060
be a casualty you know a lot of people say you got to stand up for your rights

710
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,780
right you hear that all the time I say that's great but if you know they're

711
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,580
fixing on smashing heads maybe you should take a seat for that day
