1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,080
Sonic Event 40, Ocelli in the Greek, Rated Y, and here we go.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,040
We were just talking before I pressed record about how, well, it looks like the majority

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,760
of things that you see out there that are distributed en masse are what?

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,780
And we all know this, don't we, Greek?

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,520
What are they?

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,440
Well, what do you want to call them?

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,840
Hmm, scripted, artificial, there's a lot of adjectives we could put on them.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,160
Are those accurate, those scripted and artificial, would that be accurate?

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,520
Yeah, it follows cycles.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,180
You know, people, people, you know, they say history repeats itself.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,880
It really doesn't.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,220
It's cyclical, and each cycle is slightly different, kind of like the wash.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,060
Things, certain things come out, certain things stay in.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,360
You know, for sure, any more than 100,000 people, it's all scripted.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,420
You know, audience, just like a company over 100 million has somebody in there that's directing

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,600
it that you wouldn't know of.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,920
And make no mistake, I mean, they create these things because they know there's a waiting

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,820
audience for it.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,980
I mean, nobody produces stuff like that, you know, with big budgets and mass scale to give

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,620
it to nobody.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,380
They know who they're delivering to already.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,100
I mean, yeah, you know, it's like pushing cattle on a ranch.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,260
A lot of, you know, when you want to sell a really good quality beef to others, you

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,500
don't push cattle on a ranch with quads.

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,340
It makes them nervous.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,280
The meat gets tough.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,440
You still use horses.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,340
Yeah.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,360
So anyway, if you could figure that analogy out.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:35,940
I got you.

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,380
And a new generation of cattle doesn't mean that the techniques actually change.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,800
Right.

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,980
Well, some of them, they use quads and they do make them, you know, traumatized.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Well, yeah, I mean, the the the local whatever Save Mart, you know, knockoff grocery store

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
allegedly has to get their meat from somewhere.

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,960
And if they can do it cheaper and more efficiently, regardless of the quality, well, again, there's

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
a waiting audience for it.

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,300
So anyway, Greek, what is on your mind this week, though, as far as because, I mean, I

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,860
can ask you questions about current events, but I doubt you're paying attention to most

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,140
of them.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,100
Although I found it interesting, the current scripts, you mean the current script.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,580
But there was an interesting glitch in the script recently, and I want to get your thoughts

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,440
on it real fast.

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
And then I'm sure you can roll into many other things.

45
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,500
OK, so alien disclosure, you know, like the whole time you and I are similar age whole

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,360
time we've been alive.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,240
There's been this push and pull and all they're trying to hide things and disclosure.

48
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,680
And we're going to invade Area 51 even a couple of years ago.

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:37,860
Right.

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,700
I mean, all this stuff going on.

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,820
Guess what?

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,960
A guy went in front of Congress and said directly, I'm a whistleblower.

53
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,860
I know that the federal government is hiding alien bodies.

54
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,700
I know they're hiding alien technology, that they're reverse engineering.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Now, I'm not talking about a TV show per se.

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,680
One of the things that is up front, they tell you it's scripted.

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
I mean, this was in Congress, in public.

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,560
A guy said this.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,340
We've had aliens here.

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
We have alien bodies.

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,540
We have alien technology and we're trying to reverse engineer it.

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,560
And I'm here to tell you that the government's hiding it.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,580
And a guy told that to Congress.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Now, did that make better headlines around the world?

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,700
It did not.

66
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,720
But it did happen.

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,420
Sorry.

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:21,940
Well, the language.

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,120
Well, let's say you're let's say you what you just said is verbatim and let's say you're

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,580
paraphrasing either way, it depends on what your definition of is, is all right.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,220
So if he's a whistleblower from the military, anything that's not, quote unquote, part of

72
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,420
that branch of the military is alien or or what do you call it when it's military approved

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,780
when something is, you know, they have that stamp on it.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,200
It's not mil spec.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,080
You know, what are they?

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,800
There's a term for it in the military that, you know, the the clothing, the stuff has has

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,380
to be approved.

78
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,720
Right.

79
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,120
Yeah.

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,260
It's government issue.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,400
Right.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,680
Right.

84
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,300
So government issued language.

85
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,400
If it's not within any of the departments of the military and those concerning them,

86
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,120
it's alien.

87
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,480
Right.

88
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
So it could be from another country.

89
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,620
The other thing is, well, we can get into that.

90
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,360
But reverse engineering is another thing.

91
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,420
It's just like the legal language.

92
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,420
The other thing is they're putting this out as misdirection.

93
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,100
Everything is misdirection, even though the actual happenings of the event is right in

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,340
front of you and more than plausible.

95
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,580
9-11 is a good example.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,100
All the religions are good examples of Kennedy assassination, economic crashes.

97
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,900
Those are all things that are real.

98
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,000
But but the narrative that's put in front is completely false, but it also serves another

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,400
reason.

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,780
Well, like you said, when when they tell you that, you know, it's been a terrorist attack,

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,460
it was a drill.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,960
When they tell you it was a drill, it's a terrorist attack.

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,500
There are oppositional languages that are put out to immediately quell anybody taking

104
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,120
a serious interest in something for it being the thing that it actually is.

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,160
I'm going to quickly actually share an article with you in the when I get a chance here,

106
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,120
you know, just to have you take a look at it, if you like, because it was printed in

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,660
The Guardian, just so you know about this.

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,940
But the funny thing to me, again, is that we didn't see this blasted everywhere, because

109
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,120
again, when you and I were kids, OK, there were certainly plenty of people out there

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,320
saying, you know, the truth is being hidden.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,260
The X-Files was produced.

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,040
You know, we had Leonard Nimoy doing in search of when we were much younger, so on and so

113
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,060
forth, where people were saying, well, the moment the government admits this, this will

114
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,180
be a big problem and so on and so forth.

115
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,620
And now it seems like the event occurred and well, sorry, I want to interject.

116
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,560
There is no government. There is no government in law.

117
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,940
We don't have a lawful or even legal government anymore.

118
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
It's it's in receivership.

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,540
You know what I mean?

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,700
It's like, let's say Ben and Jerry's got bought out by a shoe company and the whole

121
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
thing was reduced down to whatever.

122
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,360
And, you know, frozen pops made with sugar, water and milk.

123
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,380
They could still use the label Ben and Jerry's because they actually bought the legal

124
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,140
rights. But it's not Ben and Jerry's.

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,120
OK, so the people under the government label have made rights, have allowed this

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,980
presentation to occur from a guy who is allegedly a former part of that.

127
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,300
You know, in the article, it says he was part of military organizations and

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,600
agencies. Anything that's not part of the departments is alien.

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,540
Yes. It could even be civilian if it's civilian deemed.

130
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,120
It's the civilians are typically not deemed aliens, but they can be given that

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,920
category like the Japanese were.

132
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,640
Remember, they put them in and the Italians and Germans.

133
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,800
Right. Right. That would have been even though the Japanese were born here, they were

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,560
put in internment camps and they were classed.

135
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,120
Their citizenship was pulled.

136
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,320
By the way, your citizenship means absolutely nothing.

137
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,360
That's a privilege that could be pulled any time.

138
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,180
Of course. So, OK, so now we just just repeat rehashed from the Guardian, even if

139
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,820
you're paraphrasing, just brings up again the emphasis on what I stated.

140
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,640
Well, if you want, I can read to you the bullet points so that you don't you don't

141
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,860
have to suffer it. And then no, no, you don't have to.

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,680
I've seen it. This has been coming for a long time, by the way, and it's going to get

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,180
worse. What they want is to get you looking up when things are really going down.

144
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,820
And then when the thing when the people find out that everything's going underground,

145
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,940
then the stuff in the sky appears.

146
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,780
So it's basically trauma.

147
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,860
Yes. So the purpose of the public showing then is just distraction as far as you're

148
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,360
concerned. It's to keep you looking at this circus so that you don't pay attention to

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,840
what the actual clowns are doing.

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
Yeah, well, they're more than clowns.

151
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,020
But what they are is imagine you have someone who just hates dogs, just totally

152
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,300
reviles dogs. And you put him in charge of the largest dog kennel.

153
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,140
How do you think. Right.

154
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,640
How do you think it's going to be run?

155
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,560
And what do you think he's going to do on his private time when he's at the kennel?

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,940
Well, it's going to be a noisy as hell kennel, first of all, because they're going to

157
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,240
bark at him nonstop.

158
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,280
And the other thing is, if he can find a way that he's not under surveillance, he's

159
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,720
probably going to sit there and try and secretly kick the dogs and then tell his boss

160
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,840
he doesn't know why they're getting more and more hostile.

161
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,580
Yeah. So that's what that's what we you know, it's it's it's such a run of fiction.

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,580
You know, the fiction, you know, both fiction and truth have a bearing on reality

163
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,380
because if you pick fiction like most people do, you could run your everything

164
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,420
happening is real.

165
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,040
But if you pick the truth, let's say, you know, then still everything is real.

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
So you can create your reality from fiction or you could create it from the truth.

167
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,500
Right. So both are correct.

168
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,520
I get that. You know, the only thing that I see as a negative is when people start to

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,280
identify every single thing absolutely is unreal, because then they miss real things

170
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,640
that occur and they decide to pay attention to nothing.

171
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,220
It seems like, oh, did I just describe most of humanity or.

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,220
Well, here's the thing.

173
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,160
There's a difference for people not to be confused.

174
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,040
If you have two people coming with two distinct, different accounts or narratives or

175
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,900
stories and they both say they have the truth, it can't be true.

176
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,760
Only one of them is true or both of them are false.

177
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,740
But in the structure of reality, in other words, what impulses people rely on.

178
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,120
You can your reality could base be based on pure fiction.

179
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,120
Look at attorneys and doctors.

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,420
Right. Their reality is based on pure fiction.

181
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,380
And there any success they have, let's say, in the medical is a testament to the

182
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,000
robustness of the human body, able to resolve such abuse.

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,420
Same with the legal.

184
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200
So really cooperate in fiction.

185
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,040
Yeah. Coincidental as opposed to causal is what you're saying.

186
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,820
Like the fact that somebody got healed is really because their body healed

187
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,400
themselves. They didn't actually take care of the problem with their ridiculous

188
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,460
nonsense. No, they actually thwarted the healing process.

189
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,500
So if they didn't have that, it would if they would have recovered much faster.

190
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah. But this is the way so that people could take that fictional route.

191
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,500
Right. And still make it part of the reality.

192
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,100
Like if someone says, I'm in debt, why are you in debt?

193
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,580
Because I have three credit cards and I can't make the payments.

194
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,040
And that is their reality.

195
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,160
And they're stressed from it.

196
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,160
And material things around them change because of it.

197
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,780
And I'm telling you, that's all fiction.

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Right. There is no debt.

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,020
It can't be right.

200
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,320
And it's a it's a law.

201
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,220
It's a legal and lawful impossibility.

202
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,420
That's why when people go to court over credit card debt or any other debt,

203
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,200
it's not whether they were lent any money.

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
It's whether they agreed to do something.

205
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,040
You see, you've got to be so it preempts that, you know,

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,520
the one thing that I'm going to be getting into is

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,580
the process of things, because that's one thing that's missing out there.

208
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,720
Well, I think anything we talk about is is because it's missing.

209
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,140
It's like, oh, the the world is full of square holes.

210
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,920
And it seems like we're the only ones that have the square pegs in most subjects.

211
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,580
It really sucks. You know that, right?

212
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,420
Oh, absolutely.

213
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,820
Because you can't go out and consume information

214
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,920
because you just too many questions.

215
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,020
And I mean, I'm saying that humbly, by the way.

216
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
But but here there's a process to everything.

217
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,460
You know, like there's the the secret Coke recipe, right?

218
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,200
So if you get the recipe, don't mean, Jack,

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,340
the recipe could be a paragraph long with bullet points.

220
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,040
But the process manual is 200 pages long,

221
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,480
meaning when do you add each and each ingredient?

222
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
What temperature does each ingredient have to be at?

223
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,940
How long do you stir given ingredients and then add the next ingredients?

224
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,680
You see? Yeah, it's a process.

225
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,680
That was something I recognized even as a child when somebody said, look,

226
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,760
as long as you have the recipe, you can do this or that.

227
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,080
And I said, no, that's not true, because here's the thing.

228
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,040
I mean, look, everything pretty much that you have a recipe for

229
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,120
that was ever shown to me had water. Right.

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,440
So I would say and of course, water is one of your focuses

231
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,560
because it is one of the essential elements to everything.

232
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,020
Here's the deal.

233
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,980
How about what temperature should that water be at?

234
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,400
How about, you know, not only how much of it, because I'll tell you,

235
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,840
well, look, it says three cups of water.

236
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,720
And I'm like, yeah, but hot water, cold water, this changes things.

237
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,820
Well, the process. Yeah, it's a process.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,140
And there's processes that are always being negated.

239
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,000
So back to the alien disclosure, whatever Congress should show.

240
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,580
By the way, if you are a competent observer,

241
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,080
how this country was set up with the branches of government and all that.

242
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,520
And this was very well covered, by the way, in federalist papers

243
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,760
and other commentaries back in the day in the in the United States of America

244
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,640
is that the way that it's set up makes it really easy,

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,940
gives so much wiggle room to turn this into a completely tyrannical shithole.

246
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,340
Right. It does. Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,340
So basically, you know, everyone focuses on the president,

248
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,640
but it's really the Congress that enacts things right.

249
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,100
President cannot enact anything.

250
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,640
He can just sign a bill.

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,540
Well, that kills me.

252
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,580
That always kills me because literally it says that they are the ones

253
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,520
who legislate right.

254
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,900
They're the ones who actually create the legal structure.

255
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,400
Well, in actual. Yeah.

256
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah. Like if you go to, you know, like all of these alphabet

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
agencies are completely unlawful.

258
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
None of them are lawful.

259
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
And they only have to deal with the executive.

260
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,140
They're all functions of the executive.

261
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,560
Right. So they should only be dealing with the employees of the executive

262
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,180
and the other branches,

263
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,920
because the other branches supposedly get their check signed from that.

264
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,760
So the interesting part here is, like, for example, to pick up

265
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,020
one of these strong arm agency known as the IRS.

266
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,920
If you go to the IRS, why are you doing all this unlawful stuff?

267
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,740
They'll say, well, it's because Congress talked to Congress.

268
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,620
They enacted us.

269
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,200
And if you go to any of the congressmen that are competent, they'll say,

270
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,840
well, they threaten our lives and they threaten the lives of our children.

271
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,200
So why would you suscept the whole nation to what is it?

272
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,320
Four hundred, five hundred people in the Senate and the House of Representatives.

273
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,720
Why would you subject all of the people to the vulnerability?

274
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,200
You know, so all you got to do basically is threaten the lives of 600 men

275
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,880
in Congress, you know, both both houses and their children.

276
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,560
And they'll do anything. Oh, my gosh, that's a flawed system.

277
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,300
That's a very flawed system.

278
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,440
Very easy to leverage.

279
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,400
You can control the fate of 300 million people by taking control

280
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,480
or getting leverage over at the very least.

281
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,100
Just, you know, what? Half a thousand people, 500, a little

282
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,500
a little more than half a half could vote.

283
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,720
Right. You only 40, 51 percent.

284
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,260
I think it's more than 51 percent has to vote to enact something.

285
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,200
But it depends.

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,900
Like you have you have some things that can be done with 51 percent of the

287
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,640
you know, the majority, whatever they deem to be a majority.

288
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,740
But, you know, back to the the alien thing is there's a process here.

289
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,400
Everyone's looking at the formula and the recipe, right?

290
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,760
OK, very basic.

291
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,740
But there's a process to all of this.

292
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,800
And that process started.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,100
Guess when? 1940s, 1950s.

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,660
And here, well, mainly out of Hollywood.

295
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,100
But it really started in the 18 late 1800s.

296
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,920
Right. With the science fiction. Right.

297
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,120
Right. That's when I started creating the legend that captured the imagination

298
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,960
and things like comic books, in a way, were sort of generated

299
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,340
to to do that, to bring people to other sorts of realities,

300
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
alternate realities and alternate constructs.

301
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,280
So really, you first see aliens being introduced to people in literature

302
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,440
because that was the most easily distributed aliens.

303
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah. Extraterrestrial aliens.

304
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,020
Correct. Off world things were introduced in that literature first. Right.

305
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,840
I mean, going back to H.G.

306
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,160
Wells, going back to many, many lesser famous people.

307
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,860
This is what they did.

308
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,480
They created a whole huge universe of legend around it. Right.

309
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,020
Mm hmm. OK.

310
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,960
And you notice they never focus or give too much on the serpent, the reptilian.

311
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,120
By the way, I'm just going to throw this in here.

312
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,420
The earliest, oldest beings in this, quote unquote, known reality are not human.

313
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,540
They're reptiles, Soren.

314
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,180
You want to call them Soren? That's fine.

315
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,180
OK. You want to call them draconian reptiles?

316
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,860
Anyway, that's another discussion, isn't it?

317
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,980
It kind of is.

318
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,740
I mean, it does go along with this.

319
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,180
But, you know, it's funny because a lot of people will immediately leap

320
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,680
to the Nephilim and the, you know, and that forms are hybrids.

321
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,980
Right. Say, yeah.

322
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,660
Again, I would defer to you got to get the chronography and chronology together.

323
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,820
I would defer to Jason Breshears at Archaics for chronology on that.

324
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
When all that stuff.

325
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,980
I mean, I consumed most of his stuff on the chronology.

326
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,240
He'll do long videos on stuff sometimes.

327
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
And I just got to I'm like, all right, all right.

328
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,700
Just just just stick with the chronology chronology.

329
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
You know, it's just stick with that because the rest of the stuff,

330
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,400
you're really falling flat on your face.

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,020
But so so everyone has got a piece of the puzzle.

332
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,580
You've heard of that. Of course. Yeah.

333
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,740
But you can't you can't whittle the you can't cut the piece to fit.

334
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,240
Right. Either fits or it doesn't out of the box. Right.

335
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,819
Right. So I would go on the chronography on that,

336
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,640
which is very close to what I've been saying.

337
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,440
But I wasn't aware of so many repeat disasters as they are.

338
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,200
You know, I was aware of maybe a dozen of them

339
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
or half a dozen of them that have been covered up,

340
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,119
especially in the past two millennia.

341
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,000
Like most people, you know, you've heard of the Black Plague and all that stuff.

342
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,680
There were several of them.

343
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,800
And also people, the world did almost come to an end around the seventh

344
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,000
between the sixth and the seventh centuries.

345
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,260
So, I mean, physically, I mean, it was just horrible.

346
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,860
And that's been covered up.

347
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,460
It's called the Dark Ages, right?

348
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,400
Well, it's dark. Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,520
So, yeah, you have that recurring.

350
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,340
And then also you have things that are also repeated like the flood.

351
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,540
Now, I do believe that we can see archaeologically

352
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,220
that there were several floods in various places.

353
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,680
But it's not just about the physical reality of that.

354
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,440
It's about the stories that spread and became part of the canon

355
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,620
in religions, in legends, in everything. Right.

356
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,100
There's a flood story that goes on.

357
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Yeah. Science pretty much tells us it's all been happy dory going back

358
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,560
for two hundred thousand years and all this other crap is total bullshit.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,820
But by the way, the biggest flood known was the one that happened

360
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,320
in Genesis chapter one, verse two, where the earth became dark,

361
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,140
weltered and wasted.

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,280
And then about sixteen hundred, eighteen hundred years later is Noah's flood.

363
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,040
So when you say the big flood, most people refer to the one that,

364
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,800
you know, hearkens back to Noah.

365
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,220
But the one before that, before Adam and Eve, let's say in the story,

366
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,620
that was the biggest, worst flood that destroyed the surface and all that.

367
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,280
So those are those are your two floods, by the way.

368
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,920
The one in where the earth became wasted, weltered and wasted.

369
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Tohoho, Tohoho, right? Right.

370
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,700
So, yeah. Yeah.

371
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,560
So there's two major floods in the Bible.

372
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,680
And the first one, which is not viewed as a flood,

373
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,100
it's in the second verse of Genesis, was the worst possible thing.

374
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,460
And then the other one, which was local,

375
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,220
pretty much was the Noah's flood.

376
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,260
But yeah. So, yeah, all of these things.

377
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,360
But back to the process idea. Right.

378
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,220
I'll give an example of a process.

379
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,600
OK, so let's think of a process.

380
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,540
Let's let's say something called respiration, right?

381
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,520
Breathing. Well, the process on that is in many parts.

382
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
You have inhalation, right?

383
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,360
Then you hold the breath and then you have exhalation.

384
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,580
So just by saying respiration,

385
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,520
you get the idea that has to do with breathing.

386
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,200
You know, it's it's a technical term, right?

387
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,340
Respirator. Right. On all this other stuff.

388
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,940
Yeah. Coming from the Greek roots.

389
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Actually, there's a Greek root for the formation of that word.

390
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,980
Yeah. Yeah.

391
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,960
Might be actually a Latin respirator or respite, but might be Greek as well.

392
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,620
But anyway, you see that now the process on that is inhale,

393
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,880
exhale basically than the holding time in between. Right.

394
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,120
And then we have what rate of inhale and what rate of exhale.

395
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,660
Right. Are you standing still or are you going around jogging around the block?

396
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,160
You see? So the process of it is very rarely discussed.

397
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,300
So basically, they're talking about respiration, but they're not telling you

398
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,940
about the how the aliens inhale or exhale. Right.

399
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,360
So how did they get it? Who are you?

400
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,940
You know, you're a whistleblower.

401
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,480
Did they get given a cogent history, like in other words, a history

402
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,520
that seems tangible?

403
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,540
Oh, no, probably not.

404
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,100
You know, anybody, you know, so the whole thing is a shit show

405
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
and it's going to get worse.

406
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
And here's the you know what you know what the worst part is.

407
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,240
It's going to get religious soon.

408
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,640
It's going to get the God is the G.O.D.

409
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,320
or D.O.G., however you want to spell it.

410
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,740
Sure. Is is going to be brought into the picture

411
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,880
like it never has in recent history.

412
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,380
And then it's going to get really, really rough.

413
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,680
So I said something that stopped a whole panel of people

414
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,840
from chattering back and forth needlessly on one of these.

415
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
You know, let's invite you into a group discussion shows recently.

416
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,600
And how did I do it?

417
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,060
Because I said that, you know, the fascinating thing

418
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,100
about the alien construct and all that is that by most people's

419
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,680
estimations, their idea of God is an alien to begin with

420
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,220
and isn't actually on this planet at the moment, huh?

421
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,380
And it literally stopped all this chattering that was going.

422
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,180
Well, here's another if you want to go.

423
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,540
That's like second, third grade.

424
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
When you get to the fourth grade, fifth grade.

425
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,020
Yeah. And you start studying all the old documents.

426
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,740
I'm not I'm not disparaging you.

427
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,900
There's a second or third grade.

428
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm just saying that's what the way most people want to handle it.

429
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah, it's years ago on the private Skype groups.

430
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,380
And maybe you and I, maybe not.

431
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,980
The gods are human.

432
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,920
Sorry. Sorry, people.

433
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,520
Well, they just happen to be humans with extraordinary abilities.

434
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,880
Right. So just remember that.

435
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,040
Oh, no. You and I, you and I were on.

436
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,800
We didn't do a lot of the private Skype, you and I.

437
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,880
But the few that we were on, I remember that.

438
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,400
And I remember saying something about, yeah.

439
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,180
Well, where do you think they got the idea in the Bible?

440
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,100
Yeah. Where do you think they got the idea for Superman from? Right.

441
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,160
You know. And well, yeah, that gets complicated.

442
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,500
Yeah, that's that. Definitely.

443
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,720
Yeah, it's the see a culture always wants to define itself

444
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,500
somehow, and the easiest way to define itself is to create a myth

445
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,040
that structured a certain way that produces a certain narrative.

446
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,360
And then you associate with the character or that narrative of that myth.

447
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,700
All right. And when you talk about.

448
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah, no, I was just going to say when I brought up before and I said the flood,

449
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,580
I didn't mean the singular flood, by the way.

450
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,140
I meant the flood, which is constantly mentioned

451
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,620
and seems to be universally the same thing, when quite honestly,

452
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,540
a lot of these people are writing about things that happen to them locally.

453
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,940
Remember, we didn't quite have television back then or whatever.

454
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,440
So if something happened in Asia, they might not have witnessed it

455
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
and what they call Italy today.

456
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,040
So but the thing is that that story would carry

457
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,580
and it would become universal over time.

458
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,320
And in some cases, you have the flood as there's this one thing

459
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,840
that's represented in the literature that's not necessarily the same thing.

460
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,940
But what you're talking about in the scripture.

461
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,260
Yes, that's exactly how it goes.

462
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,760
But what I'm saying is you could have, you know, a seemingly world

463
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,140
ending event that occurred just in this valley that the majority

464
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,620
of the inhabitants would never leave during their entire lifetimes.

465
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
But they would think the world ended because the whole world was not.

466
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,300
It did world world is basically a society.

467
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,740
So, you know, you have different worlds without the let's see, attachments

468
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,180
that could be created with airlines and ships and communications.

469
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,180
Yeah. Most people, their world was whatever it was,

470
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,400
meaning their everyday function and even even their thought, you know,

471
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,020
well, far flung mobility is a fairly recent event in this current,

472
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,680
you know, timeline as far as our history goes.

473
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah, there was a time after the Dark Ages where there was worldwide travel

474
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,700
using aviation.

475
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,760
The Vamanas, you'll find in the Hindu society

476
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,020
still writings on that.

477
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,680
They were revived going back.

478
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,580
OK, Bob Lazar, the area 51 whistle, but whatever guy that guy element 115,

479
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,100
that guy, if you look at his stuff, there's hundreds of hours,

480
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,920
let's say 100 hours of his stuff for for a minute and a half out of those 100 hours.

481
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,120
This is what I got out of it. That was worth it.

482
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,360
So where did they find this stuff?

483
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,620
And he says, archaeological dig.

484
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,980
But no, you could talk to a thousand people that are into Bob Lazar.

485
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,380
And you'll ask, well, where did they find the flying saucers?

486
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,480
And they all shrug their shoulders.

487
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,320
I don't know, but he does mention it was found in what?

488
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,580
An archaeological dig deep underground.

489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500
So that's all you got to know.

490
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,020
Well, another fascinating thing is I was recently explaining to somebody that,

491
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,760
you know, when do you think rocket technology and,

492
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,120
you know, other technologies of flight occurred?

493
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,500
And they go, well, it must have been the early 1900s

494
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,960
because of the Wright brothers, blah, blah.

495
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,180
Or maybe it was as far back as Da Vinci, you know, whatever, because airplanes.

496
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,640
Right. Or maybe it was Da Vinci because Da Vinci had designs,

497
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,800
but he didn't realize them.

498
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
And some of those things look very weird that he's got, you know,

499
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,600
but rockets are stupid, by the way, they might be stupid.

500
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,800
But you do realize they had these schematics for this stuff.

501
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
There's manuscripts out there showing schematics for this,

502
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,020
going back to like the 1300s.

503
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,160
Well, the culture that developed the the propulsion method,

504
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,920
you know, the high speed chemistry that's used in rockets

505
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,380
never thought of putting people on that.

506
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,520
Now, that was the in Asia.

507
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,300
They've had it for more than 2000 years,

508
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,400
you know, gunpowder and all that stuff.

509
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,660
Right. High speed chemistry reactions.

510
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,840
No one in the ancient world ever thought of putting only the twisted

511
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,120
meat eater minds of the Americans in part, part, part of the the Nazis.

512
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
Right. Revived it.

513
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,200
No, they they had it set up in this 1300s manuscript

514
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,480
that somebody discovered only a few years ago, according to what I read.

515
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,560
You know, they were transporting things, not people,

516
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,680
but they would actually be able to safely send things over long distances

517
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,260
with that high speed chemistry as far back as that.

518
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,500
You know, I mean, look, maybe. Yeah.

519
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,960
But it's it's a dumb idea.

520
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,440
Listen, I'm not saying it's smart.

521
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm just saying that it existed.

522
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,360
A lot of people think it started with, you know, the Nazis,

523
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,660
Wernher von Braun, blah, blah, blah.

524
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,920
And I'm like, no, these ideas were around

525
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,060
and people actually were trying to execute them much earlier in history.

526
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,780
The airplane didn't start with the Wright brothers either.

527
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,500
You know, et cetera, et cetera.

528
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,780
So I'm just saying that this concept of here's your innovator,

529
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,820
here's the guy who created radio, here's the guy who created wireless

530
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,480
and whatnot, usually is very ill-informed official.

531
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,580
Well, it's usually tied to an official story, which is

532
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,640
which is the worst possible source or worst possible.

533
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,980
That's why it's reinforced as such. Right.

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,380
I think you go on a YouTube or something and you look up moon landings

535
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,900
and they'll plug a Wikipedia, like a blue highlighted box

536
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,800
underneath. Here is your real information to go along with this thing.

537
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,880
It was dumb enough to go when they first started doing that years ago.

538
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,240
I was trying to click on it to try to get rid of it.

539
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,560
I found that it became a feature. Right.

540
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,880
So, yeah, there's a lot of features.

541
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,240
Yeah, they did that to me.

542
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,860
There was like 300 of my videos where I discussed aspects of the JFK assassination,

543
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,140
not always discussing conspiracy laden aspects either.

544
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,120
In some cases, forensic science or, you know, here's how the ballistics worked

545
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,540
or here's how, you know, this this person with this science

546
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,340
explained and examined this or whatever, very basic and academic, you would think.

547
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,640
And in some cases, there would be one of those little disclaimers

548
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,320
under there with a Wikipedia entry.

549
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,320
Go look at this and you go there. And what is it?

550
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,680
Lee Harvey Oswald is most likely the guy who shot Kennedy on.

551
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Yeah, well, it's pretty blatant.

552
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,520
They had already set up a kill zone.

553
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,460
It was very specific and very highly agreed on.

554
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,760
Right. Because of the speed of the vehicle and the location.

555
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,420
And I believe that it was overtly known by many people by, you know,

556
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,840
who and how it was done and witnesses. Right.

557
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,640
But it just never got out.

558
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,620
Another example, it ties very nicely to the JFK is 9-11.

559
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,440
Like, for example, that's not a terrorism.

560
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,900
It was sabotage.

561
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,240
In other words, the nuclear demolition feature,

562
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,820
it was installed into those buildings via tunnels

563
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,000
way before even the the the the building permit was issued. Right.

564
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,540
So in other words, if you have a nuke in a in a urban environment,

565
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,480
it could it needs to be maintained.

566
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,280
But if you want to set it off, you need what's called a trigger mechanism.

567
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,560
Right. And that trigger mechanism is held by the Department of Energy.

568
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,980
And once the Department of Energy approves it, they call up the OST,

569
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,420
which is a part of the Secret Service.

570
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,120
The OST stands for Office of Special Transportation,

571
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,560
and they physically pick up the trigger from the DOE

572
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,260
and physically deliver it on site where there are DOT and OST and FEMA

573
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,320
and every the companies, EG and G, that do monitoring.

574
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,980
OK, so I can go on and on and on.

575
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,480
Yeah. Yeah. You're describing these people are talking.

576
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,900
Yeah. No, you're describing literally a part of this process.

577
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,920
There is a whole part of that process there where there's special

578
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,100
transportation units.

579
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,300
People might not be aware of this, but that'll handle special technologies

580
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,020
that handle particular types of people.

581
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,380
And a lot of these agencies are not, you know, things that you know of right away,

582
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,520
but they are, you know, branches of, say, the Secret Service.

583
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,460
The military has special transportation groups for certain things.

584
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,280
Beyond transportation.

585
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,460
I just went through a litany of groups and agencies,

586
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,220
and there's got to be more than two people in each one of these agencies

587
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,180
that knows about it.

588
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,920
How come they're not speaking?

589
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,360
And where are the witnesses?

590
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,460
Because they go home.

591
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,500
Let's say they have a wife or a dog or a cat or children or relatives.

592
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,620
Aren't they going to say anything?

593
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,840
They're going to say something.

594
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,260
Where are those people?

595
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,380
How come no one's speaking?

596
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,620
Right. There could have been there could have been 50 or.

597
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,060
Well, here's I'll stake my life on it.

598
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,300
There are at least 50 people that witness where the gunshots came from

599
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,320
and even saw the shooter that we never heard of.

600
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,640
You know, meaning witnesses that never got a chance to go public. Right.

601
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,240
And not immediately. No.

602
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,680
And some of them, people like me had to dig up later and get stories where,

603
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,640
you know, we had skittish people that maybe wanted to go on the record,

604
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,900
maybe didn't, et cetera.

605
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,180
So it was it was a weird situation, actually, with those people.

606
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,740
And this is what I say to those people and all people.

607
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,860
If you do if you don't do it, look, if they dislike you enough,

608
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,180
they'll blow your head off or find an excuse to kill you.

609
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,300
But don't you want to kick them in the shins at least once

610
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,480
because you're going to go anyway?

611
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,160
Yeah, do it. I really wish that I could have convinced.

612
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,540
As a matter of fact, there was a lady.

613
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,660
I'll tell you a quick little strange anecdote.

614
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,620
Just real fast.

615
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,540
There was a lady that took, let's say, photographs.

616
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,280
Let's say photographic evidence.

617
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,700
She had taken herself, you know, very much like some of the other people

618
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,520
who filmed the events there.

619
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,100
And when she brought it to go, develop it like a normal person would.

620
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,980
The film didn't come back to her.

621
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,160
And she had a a person from the government waiting at her house

622
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,720
when she went home after not, you know, sorry, your pictures didn't come out

623
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,860
to tell her that.

624
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,940
Yeah, she was definitely not going to get those pictures to come out.

625
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,340
And if she goes back and checks, they will have lost her film with good reason.

626
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,760
And it's interesting how the tracking, you know, everyone's concerned

627
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,560
about tracking today with technology.

628
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,540
So it seemed to have existed pretty robustly back then.

629
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,780
Yeah, they seem to know where everybody went.

630
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,120
And I mean, that's not I'm not talking about the sheriff's department

631
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,780
or because I've been through their documents, all that I'm talking about

632
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,880
in black type stuff.

633
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,420
Yeah. An agency that is not really named.

634
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,500
Some people say, oh, that must be the FBI.

635
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,680
But that's not the kind of badge they flashed.

636
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,440
The alphabet agencies are in your face blatant.

637
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,180
We're going to strong arm you using these alphabet agencies.

638
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,000
But there's a lot.

639
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,460
There's an entire society or group that is brought up from childhood

640
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,680
and within their culture to hate humanity, even though they're humans themselves.

641
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,120
And that's who's running all of that.

642
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,380
And everyone is under that system and being observed by them

643
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,500
at various times, especially if you're near a significant person or event.

644
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Right. So I've had someone I know that I worked with in some capacity

645
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
in a business capacity.

646
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,100
She would be in places and she'd be calling me and she says,

647
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,220
I'm at Hunter Biden's house.

648
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm like, don't call me from that.

649
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,240
You know what? Don't call me.

650
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,500
I think when we were doing what Charlie and the Greek, I told you about her.

651
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,060
I said, she's visiting the vice president's son and he's really horrible person.

652
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,720
And I don't know if you remember that back in 2015, 2016.

653
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,720
Yes. Well, 2015 before.

654
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,100
Right. And I was like, oh, and I was like, don't call me because you know what?

655
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,360
Happens if you try to make right.

656
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
They get all you get everybody. Right.

657
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,520
Yeah. Well, that's the thing is you get swept up in the we talked about that

658
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,040
surveillance off air, actually.

659
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah. We weren't recording at the time.

660
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,240
We were just we used to just have these conversations.

661
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,440
Yeah. I think I gave you the dirt on Hunter Biden before even anyone who he's

662
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,260
who even cared about.

663
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah. I didn't even know that he had.

664
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,740
I didn't know that.

665
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,380
Bob, I see. I knew about Bo Biden, but I didn't know about his brother.

666
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,480
That was the Bo Bo died.

667
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,200
And it wasn't he killed in one of the wars, Iraq or something.

668
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
I think he died of cancer.

669
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,400
He actually died of cancer.

670
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,720
Yeah. Right. From one of the burning pits or something.

671
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,380
Right. In the burning pit. Right.

672
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,620
All the chemical exposed, which is a real thing.

673
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,660
People were exposed to a lot of nasty.

674
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,060
Yeah. Yeah. And it's all I mean, it's just so bizarre.

675
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,680
You know, by the way, anyone who's got three brain cells together,

676
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,120
you just need two. But the third one is like a spare.

677
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,120
Yeah. It's been in any military knows that it's all bogus,

678
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,820
unless you're in like the French Foreign Legion or something. Right.

679
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,300
It's all bogus.

680
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,180
So the only movie that I've ever liked about that was Jarhead,

681
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,060
where the sergeant is telling them, remember,

682
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,120
you signed a car when they told him to do something and they were hesitant.

683
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,000
He'd say, you signed a contract.

684
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,560
Remember? Oh, yeah. Contract. It's all business. It's all.

685
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,340
Yeah. Humans are morons and people in the military are weaponized morons.

686
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,699
So what are you going to do? Right.

687
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,440
Not much.

688
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,100
But I still stick with when I start talking to people

689
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,320
and I see there's a hint that they're going to fade off.

690
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,620
I say, have you been on this planet more than 15 minutes?

691
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,500
You've been more than 15 minutes on planet Earth.

692
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,159
I kind of repeat it like that

693
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,080
just so they make sure that they heard me right.

694
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,020
And they're like, yeah, of course.

695
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,400
Now they're not going to glaze away.

696
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,800
And after two minutes of Greek speak at a hardware store,

697
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,520
they're like, by the way, have you heard this before? No.

698
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,940
Have you run into anyone that said stuff like this before? No.

699
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,460
I said, yeah, you know what? You probably won't ever again.

700
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,460
So anyway, yeah, it's really sad here anyway.

701
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,060
But you have to make the best of it.

702
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,480
Remember, you live in this is an amoral society.

703
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,620
Amoral means there's no right and wrong. Right.

704
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,780
You're encouraged to follow your dreams. Right.

705
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,320
Or follow. Right. Whatever you want to do.

706
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,620
That's encouraged. Right.

707
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,700
You notice that's encouraged first before being good

708
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,340
or being lawful or anything like that.

709
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,700
So that makes it an immoral society.

710
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,340
When you tell children in a society at large

711
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,460
that follow your dreams and do what you want to do.

712
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm not talking Alistair Crowley stuff now.

713
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Just generally first first before doing the right thing or being lawful.

714
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,920
That's an amoral society branded. Right.

715
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,820
You see. So. Yeah.

716
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,580
But, you know, the only difference there is when somebody says, you know,

717
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,740
you should do what's right or you should act,

718
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,160
which, again, is the definition of first, though.

719
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,040
First is follow your dreams and do what you want. Right.

720
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,700
First, I think of how many.

721
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,200
Well, statistically, if you look at it, you'll hear follow your dreams

722
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,940
and do what you want to do more than do the right thing

723
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,720
or more than be good or more than be lawful. Right.

724
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,320
A lot more. Yeah.

725
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,780
Well, that's why, you know, quite frankly, again,

726
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,900
even though Alistair Crowley was a Crowley, excuse me, was a plagiarist,

727
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,400
he did state the truth when he said, you know, do what thou wilt

728
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,060
shall be the whole of the law.

729
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,920
Well, that's in this situation to a certain degree.

730
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,700
Yep. To a certain degree.

731
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,400
But there's a lot of there's a lot of conditions that are left out.

732
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,380
So he was a you know, he's a well was well known, well established.

733
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,160
He was a foreign agent. Right.

734
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,640
Oh, well, a multiply useful to multiple agencies

735
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,400
at the very least.

736
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,260
And anybody who became his consort of one type or another also. Right.

737
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,000
I mean, blatantly with the Michael Aquino's of the world and all that, too.

738
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,020
Yeah, that goes into the the parallel society and all that leaking over.

739
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,220
Just like if there was a more advanced parallel society,

740
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,300
they would get lackeys or people from here that work as slaves.

741
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,780
There are those that come from another society that lives in the underworld.

742
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,680
It could be on the surface, but be considered the underworld

743
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,600
that leak into this society and get notoriety. Right.

744
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,080
Like the ones you mentioned. Oh, yeah. Sounds to me like.

745
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,200
But they're the lackeys, though.

746
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,720
They're not the high functioning ones.

747
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah, but it sounds to me like, you know, you know, the phrase

748
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,620
as above and so shall it be the same below.

749
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,700
However, they say it.

750
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,980
It's kind of interesting to me, because it seems like that's actually the way

751
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,980
the ethereal or spiritual or whatever else.

752
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,220
That's exactly how that works.

753
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,780
Well, we're in the middle.

754
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,740
There's it depends.

755
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,300
You know, you could say as above, so below, meaning of the sky or as above.

756
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,380
So below, meaning on the surface underground.

757
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,720
Of course, it goes.

758
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,860
You see, you know how they say there's two sides to a coin,

759
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,520
but everyone leaves out the reeded edge, the edge of the coin,

760
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,660
the third side, which determines its value.

761
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,180
So all of these things have ratios that are unacknowledged.

762
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,720
That need to be looked at.

763
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,560
Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,340
And that's what Greek speak does really.

765
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Sad to say.

766
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,740
Sad because it's a.

767
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,540
It's kind of like a place where the onus is on the Greek

768
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,560
to come up with this stuff to a certain degree and and make

769
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,980
and find it, make it a working knowledge.

770
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,060
You know, not talking about things that aren't pertinent

771
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,340
and not useful. Right.

772
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,300
That's the hard part.

773
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,420
You know, actually, you always want to make it working knowledge.

774
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,680
Well, the difficulty level should be described

775
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,700
thusly, given the metaphor you just laid out, which is this.

776
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,800
You know, you flip a coin, right?

777
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,700
What do they tell you to call heads or tails?

778
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,880
But occasionally, ever so occasionally,

779
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,620
it can land on that beaded edge.

780
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
There is another option.

781
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,880
But the rarity of that is just about the rarity of the truth or reality.

782
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,680
Yeah. When it comes to this world.

783
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,760
So there you go.

784
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,820
That's that's the rarity of actual morality.

785
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,300
That's the rarity of actual, you know, knowledge,

786
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,360
as opposed to all the noise and nonsense, isn't it?

787
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,060
Sure is. Hey, how about we jump into the chat just for a moment?

788
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,360
Oh, absolutely.

789
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,700
I was thinking that we were almost at the end here.

790
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,500
But let's go to the chat. Go ahead.

791
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,780
We are a question keeps being brought up about the silver,

792
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,160
the silver and the water.

793
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,540
And one of the things that just rang out, I have gone over it loosely.

794
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,260
Maybe I'll try to tighten it up.

795
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,000
Why do you need electricity?

796
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,460
Actually, you don't.

797
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,580
But electricity is the most convenient way to do it.

798
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,680
It's regarding the aqua sargentum.

799
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
This is not colloidal silver, by the way.

800
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,020
Colloidal silver is toxic.

801
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,920
And I believe it's toxic in any amount.

802
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,860
Right. Because if you understand how the body works with induction,

803
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,380
it will create instead of using the energy of the silver,

804
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,780
it will try to create the metallic silver, which is toxic in the body.

805
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,900
You want the the quality of the silver without the quantity. Right.

806
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,300
So the reason why electricity

807
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,320
is preferred to be used is because of the push.

808
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,220
How do you the silver metal, whether I'm not going to say coin form,

809
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,940
but pure silver metal, if you want to get the quality,

810
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,560
the bacteriostatic, fungicidal

811
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,760
and other qualities of silver into the water

812
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,620
because the water is the most biocompatible agent.

813
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,240
How do you take that field or that effect,

814
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,940
nonmaterial effect that silver has and get it into the water?

815
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,440
Imagine the silver material itself is like a dolly or a trolley

816
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
or a truck or a box.

817
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,960
And the field is in that box.

818
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,700
How do you get it to go into the water?

819
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,840
You have to push it or dump it out. Right. OK.

820
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,700
And electricity is what pushes just the field.

821
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,380
If you just use the right subtle amount of electricity,

822
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,300
it will push the quality and leave the material behind

823
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,020
and push that quality and imbue that quality into the water.

824
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,780
In view, I always like that word.

825
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,180
I wonder if it's a French word.

826
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,560
And then the so the silver

827
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,420
positive qualities that we are looking for, no pun intended,

828
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,720
you know, positive and negative electricity.

829
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,160
So once those qualities are imbued in the water,

830
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,900
then the water being the most appropriate by a lot

831
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,760
biocompatible agent will then imbue it and transfer it to the body.

832
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,740
I am open to other ways of doing it.

833
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,960
Wilhelm Reich mechanical movement creates some energy build up,

834
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,660
which then creates an energy discharge.

835
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,460
Mm hmm. That's why this is the years ago.

836
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,120
Those that had silverware, real silverware,

837
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,560
were not as prone to things inducing things,

838
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,040
diseases and contagions like others did.

839
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:02,140
So, yes, drinking from a silver goblet using a silver spoon is beneficial.

840
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,540
But still, if you understand how friction works on a most finite level,

841
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,980
if you're using a silver spoon for years and years and years,

842
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,280
especially if it's plated or a goblet, you'll notice that

843
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,800
after years and years and years of use and wear, some of the silver is gone,

844
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,160
whereas material is gone, isn't it? Mm hmm.

845
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,840
So you're taking the silver again.

846
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,400
So the best way to determine how to push that field off

847
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,240
is a slight electrical push, because everything in the world

848
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,380
works on pressure mediation, the things where a higher pressure

849
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,180
will always go to a lower pressure to what find equilibrium.

850
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,600
Yeah, so that's basically it.

851
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,820
Also, just a reminder, I am nearly done with a standard

852
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,520
aqueous Argentum kit.

853
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,600
OK, I'm not I'm not really offering these,

854
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,120
but I did offer one one request from someone I value.

855
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,540
That is also a sub I've known for a while and it will be on their way.

856
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,100
And why not?

857
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,320
When I'm making one, I can make two and I can make another one for myself.

858
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,120
I offered to do a giveaway.

859
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,740
So I just wanted to put that out again.

860
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,260
There will be a giveaway based on all of the subs on Rated Y

861
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,120
that Chuck will pick at random.

862
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,640
All right. So and I've been going through actually doing a bit of a audit

863
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,020
just to make sure about who's on the list,

864
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,880
make sure that there are duplicates and everything to prepare that

865
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,340
for a random selection.

866
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,320
And really quickly, I just while you were talking, I figured I'll go look

867
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,620
because I love etymology dot com. OK.

868
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,240
It's really a valuable tool.

869
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,180
And early 15th century, this is a verb in view

870
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:45,720
to keep wet, to soak, to saturate, also figuratively to cause, to absorb.

871
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,660
OK. And the it says that

872
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,140
it has a Latin and a French origin, but it's somewhat uncertain

873
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,920
from possibly from the Latin in vibrate, in vibrate.

874
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,940
I am B. I. B. E. R. E.

875
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,480
Which I believe is in beavery.

876
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,160
But anyway, drink in, soak in is in quotes next to it.

877
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,480
And it also says to see him vibe.

878
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,940
So it might have also been influenced by the English word for for that as well.

879
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,120
So there you go. It's a it's sort of a loosely.

880
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,940
Yeah. From Latin and French.

881
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,640
All right. So we don't have a misunderstanding.

882
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,660
Remember George Bush, the junior, the small bush?

883
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,080
Yeah. He said the reason why French

884
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,520
aren't good at business is because they don't have a word for entrepreneur.

885
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,900
I love that.

886
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,420
Yeah. You know, that's the kind of stock you have.

887
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,500
That's what they think about.

888
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,040
You know, when they are really stupid leaders,

889
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,820
which they all are at this point and have been.

890
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,520
That's those that are in control, trying to show you what they think of you.

891
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,480
Yeah. I mean, my favorite from him will always be, though, the whole,

892
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,000
you know, fool me once,

893
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,240
fool me twice.

894
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
You can't get fooled again.

895
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,100
Yeah. Like you couldn't even keep that very simple.

896
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,620
You know, I think

897
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,820
he couldn't do the fool me once.

898
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,940
Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me.

899
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,900
He couldn't do it.

900
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,600
He just that's why I've always said if you vote at elections, you get what you deserve,

901
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,640
you know, because the voting does not elect the electors elect.

902
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,340
Then they tell you that the Electoral College does.

903
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,200
So if you vote, you get what you deserve.

904
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,400
Voting just means that you are giving your endorsement to the process

905
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,620
that whoever is an elector is going to do the right thing for you.

906
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,940
This is how ridiculous it is.

907
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,340
So it's really it's really for you to select the elect,

908
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,940
which was another word for the elite, by the way.

909
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,620
And I guess if they called it that nowadays, people might see it as a conspiracy.

910
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,220
And indeed, guess what? It is a conspiracy.

911
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,060
So the elite, excuse me, the elite, by the way,

912
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,460
they just happen to be in the position they are.

913
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,620
And they just happen to hate humans or hate people.

914
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,700
Yeah. And that's the if you understand that deeply,

915
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,900
you'll understand the condition that we're in.

916
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,080
And yeah, so.

917
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,060
But there was there was a class concept called the elect, though.

918
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,320
I mean, there really was.

919
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,920
That was a proper way to describe people that were what in an elevated position

920
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,700
in society, they were the elite, so to speak.

921
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,060
So, yeah, you could actually and I always find that fascinating.

922
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,620
And just as fascinating as the people go, they stole the election.

923
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,280
Who did they steal it from?

924
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,540
It wasn't you because you didn't own it in the first place.

925
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,940
And that's right. You're not an elector.

926
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,800
Yeah. Show up at a voting booth, say you were here not to be a voter,

927
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,880
but you want to elect.

928
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,200
I had someone do that once in Arizona and they had him stand over here

929
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,780
and they had him sit there for like two hours

930
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,560
until a bunch of men in black type people came.

931
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,240
They had to call them up and they came and they started asking personal questions.

932
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,380
So this was a long time ago, maybe 2008 or something like that.

933
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,460
So, you know, in other words, what they asked was not illegal or unlawful.

934
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,340
They just wondered where the hell he came from.

935
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,720
And I said, you should have just told him you're just visiting this planet, you know?

936
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,600
Yeah. But, you know, people are afraid about being confined, you know.

937
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,280
And back then it was a little more common, I think.

938
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,540
I think it still happens today.

939
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,340
But, you know, they do have these ways of what was that

940
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,960
that term they use for a little bit of rendition, right?

941
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,620
Where they rendition you, which I always found hilarious

942
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,120
because it's a rendition is to, you know, you do a rendition,

943
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,540
you're doing a version of something and they're taking you, they're snatching you.

944
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,100
How is that a rendition?

945
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,200
I guess, right.

946
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,940
You rendition is usually a reduction of something.

947
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,200
Not what the way they're using it.

948
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,820
But anyway, I just want to go back to the silver real quick, Chuck, because

949
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,960
people are going to be I noticed for years, people will be wrestling with ideas

950
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,120
that drive things home very simply,

951
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,120
especially when they it's not that they're disregarding ideas.

952
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,420
It's that everything that's put out is so contrary.

953
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,420
In other words, the convention that the body absorbs things. Right.

954
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,800
And if this is good this way, more of it is better, you know, or whatever.

955
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,340
The the thing is to make knowledge as functional as possible.

956
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,860
Like, what do you see?

957
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,540
Want to get into also in the future about how to look at things,

958
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,560
you know, when someone hands you something or when someone points into a direction

959
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,200
and says, do you see that?

960
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,440
It's like, how do how do you actually look at things?

961
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,960
Right. You know, basically on a construction site,

962
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,620
you ever see a carpenter to hold up a board and look a certain way,

963
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,840
see if it has a bow in it or where the crown is. Right.

964
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,800
You know, things like that. How to look at things.

965
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,400
I've noticed that most people don't have that skill

966
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,980
or how to make it, let's say, work between the senses, between the ears

967
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,400
and then what comes out of their mouth to communicate.

968
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,680
So all of these things.

969
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,380
What I would suggest, though, is that once you understand induction,

970
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,820
where there is no material aspect to the process, it's all energetic

971
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,660
and you can pick another word.

972
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,160
That's why I lean on saying the body works by induction

973
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,980
instead of just saying energy. Right.

974
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,520
Because that word energy has been abused. Yes.

975
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,520
And then you understand that the food or the intake or whatever,

976
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,300
let's say a remedy has to comport to that.

977
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,680
It cannot be wholly material. Right.

978
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,840
So again, and the other thing is pressure mediation.

979
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,020
That's what makes anything fly or move. Right.

980
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,080
The high pressure goes to a low pressure to make equilibrium.

981
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,540
The one thing I'll get into in the future is also what equilibrium

982
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,360
in the body really is and why there is no such thing as health.

983
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,800
Health should always be a consideration on what you what condition you want to be.

984
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,580
And I think we've briefly covered that where someone says, what's healthy?

985
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,480
I said, there's no such thing. Are you healthy for what?

986
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,420
Do you want to climb Mount Everest next week

987
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,080
or are you going to be sitting at an office job?

988
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,420
There is no such thing as good health.

989
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,200
It's what condition you want to be in.

990
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,600
Are you running a marathon? Right. What are you doing?

991
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,620
Are you a single mom with five children?

992
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,560
All those things require different health conditions and fitness.

993
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,160
The word instead of health should be fitness.

994
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,380
What level of fitness are you looking for?

995
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:28,730
So all of these things that make a functional knowledge. Absolutely.
