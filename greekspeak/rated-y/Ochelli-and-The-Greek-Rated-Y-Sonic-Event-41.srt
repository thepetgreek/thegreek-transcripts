1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,710
Everybody's different. Yeah, that's why relationships that well, go ahead start. I'll talk about it a little bit

2
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,810
Rated Y sonic event

3
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,190
Ocelli in the Greek. There you go. I marked it. I said it and here we are

4
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,610
Greek, how you doing? Oh, I'm not annoyed. That's good. That's a good thing

5
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,230
I think I define that by the way, just everybody a personal note. That's

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,550
That's my termination point when I say that's annoying. It doesn't get any worse than that

7
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,090
It's you know, a lot of people, you know, you ran my dog over with a car or you're an asshole or whatever for me

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,290
It's like I just can't take things that are annoying

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,310
And everybody's got their own personal preference, but here's the thing I've

10
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,730
Earmarked that word as a very serious condition

11
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,130
So when everybody's different, you know people keep birds in cages as pets, but what happens when you put a cardinal or a blue jay?

12
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,230
Certain birds like that to cage. They just drop dead after a few days, right no matter what you could do for him, right?

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,590
They have to be in the wild. There are aviaries that have them but they're large aviaries

14
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,130
Discussed every animal changes in captivity. I mean we've talked about how certain animals cannot breed in cacti captivity and

15
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,030
Indeed the fact that pigs are kept in captivity. This is what makes them crazy. And this is what makes them

16
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,690
Very dirty. In fact, a wild pig is a cleaner animal than they then a kept one in a pen, right?

17
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,390
We talked about that. Well because they were set up to always be moving. Yeah, no, you put them somewhere where they right

18
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,750
Go against I mean and a bird in a cage by definition a flying bird in a cage, but this is not a good idea

19
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,950
I don't I never understood that because well, they could be bred just like people right before we're talking about relationships and it's like

20
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,190
it's very difficult to talk about it because that is so cultural and tradition and

21
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,210
Whatever you call that culture and tradition the way you're raised

22
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,130
Intensive when you hear people talking about what they like to eat

23
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,550
Relationships and like that that is ninety nine point nine nine nine percent their upbringing and what culture they're in strict strictly

24
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,550
There's very little cause of natural. Well, of course, you know within let's just say relationships

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,510
You've got different aspects right companionship the sexual part the whatever whatever whatever goes on and on and on all that

26
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,610
I'm telling you that what you people will think is personal preference comes directly from your culture

27
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,610
You have their people don't know what they prefer. Some people do and guess what?

28
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,770
That's called kinky. You have proclivities or what do you call it fetishes, right? You hear that? Yeah again again, that's part of the culture

29
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,350
Well, see here's difficult to say, but but here's the thing in my mind

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,830
Okay, there is your natural design if you were not guided by your culture

31
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,450
Wouldn't you follow your natural design if your culture didn't warp it in the first place?

32
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,410
I mean not a human not a human. No. No human is all external input. They know downloads

33
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,970
You don't come with any downloads you come with the equipment to receive downloads in process, but no

34
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,090
Yeah, so if you receive no cultural information

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,270
If that's just not part of the cultures program

36
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,870
You'll pick it up from whatever

37
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,190
Here's the most interesting study and that would be to raise someone alone, which would not be possible. The baby would die, right?

38
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,430
It would just around plants and no animals and no humans, yeah, that's not possible

39
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,310
Physiologically, well, they will die. Yeah, they won't make it

40
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,230
Yeah, and I mean like a Truman Show type thing where you have a little trapdoor where they get food and stuff like that

41
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,390
They never have any human and animal contact. Yeah, but that's around plants

42
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,750
But that's no good because we've already seen studies where people's lifespans are significantly short shortened

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,970
I wouldn't say it's no good. There's plenty of people to experiment with. Come on

44
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:14,010
Listen but what I'm saying is that what I've seen is data that shows that if you don't have personal interaction

45
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,450
It shortens your lifespan. It does it at the end of life

46
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,390
It doesn't in the beginning of life a lot of infants can die without that's why they pick up babies

47
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,350
Even if they're abandoned they keep picking them up not just to change them

48
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,310
No, no, I know but what I'm saying is what most people think they're observing as part of their choice

49
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,110
Mechanism and decision mechanism or let's say choice present choices are not decisions, right?

50
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,890
Their decision make it mechanism is completely based on how they were raised and where they were raised

51
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,710
So when you talk about something like relationships, right?

52
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,150
It's what's acceptable within the culture, you know, and how you were raised and again people think they're like, oh, yeah

53
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,150
You know, I'm real whatever because I have a fetish of this or percolating for that

54
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,890
That's still you borrowed that from someone else very little. Yeah, right. So here him. Let me just cut to the chase

55
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,950
Let's say with relationships the ultimate

56
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,530
Ultimate perspective on it. Like when you have man and a woman they would only have sex to procreate period period

57
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,150
That's it. Okay, it doesn't mean they can't be intimate, right?

58
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,430
So the concept of having an orgasm and all that stuff directly with all that is strictly for having children, right?

59
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,750
The rest of it. Okay is if you you want to go to the okay here

60
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,530
See but that's culture to me that's culture because here's the thing from a purely

61
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,550
Reactive standpoint right the fact that it just feels good to do it

62
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,890
Might also be a cause isn't that something at well? Gee, I

63
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,570
Feels good. So I do it. I mean, that's just the reaction of any

64
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:53,410
Organism if it is positive stimulus if they enjoy it if there is something good that comes from it, right?

65
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,250
to do with having sex though or you know, the

66
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,030
Cover your ears the fucking fart right? That is cultural. You can be very intimate

67
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,090
With someone you naked and all that right? This is rated Y not rated X, but yeah

68
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:17,250
Yeah, so without the type of quote-unquote sex that but here's an example, you know

69
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,870
One of the experiments they're trying to get those pandas which are not bears by the way pandas are their own species

70
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,190
To have to mate they actually showed them human porn right to maybe to give him the idea

71
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,670
but he was never able to

72
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,410
He was never successful

73
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,250
Because they pulled out when anyway, you know, so right

74
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,110
Yeah, but the whole thing about

75
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,750
Relationships again is custom tailored for you

76
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,670
Right from the beginning

77
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,650
From the beginning meaning where when you when you were brought up and where and how you were brought up

78
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,510
You know

79
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,110
Fetishism look fetishism to one degree or another you could say that there is a

80
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,730
fetishistic aspect almost to any

81
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,750
even the most really standard sexuality that we know of the people expressed because

82
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,290
Let's let's be frank. Like why is it that a man is fascinated with with a woman's breasts for instance again?

83
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:24,250
That's taught but okay, that's taught but it seems odd because that serves no practical function

84
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,030
Except no, no, but Chuck. Hold on. Hold on. Okay within that man's life

85
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,290
He's going to hear about something like that and he has a choice whether to go to make the decision of that's what you say

86
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,970
They would never be seen that way. There's a story with

87
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,390
Jack fresco, they went to an island to educate the the natives and they were always topless the girls, right?

88
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,170
I was curious. I think about fresco, by the way, but go ahead. Yeah

89
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,570
Yeah, so they gave him t-shirts to cover up and they got the t-shirts and they cut holes to let their breasts hang out

90
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,870
Okay, so it defeated the purpose

91
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,170
you know, it's this purpose is to everything, you know, I don't know you hear about the

92
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,490
Explosion at the cheese factory in France

93
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,970
It was there was debris everywhere

94
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,930
And

95
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:18,630
Yeah, okay, so it's kind of like that the joke in other words when people are persistent about something they see being normal

96
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,050
Right when you try to change that they're gonna try to normalize which right?

97
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,050
So it's normal for this culture for the women to expose their breasts just like it was an ancient creed

98
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,450
By the way, the Minoan society ancient times when women really got dressed up

99
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,690
The entire body was covered except their breasts and you could go look at the artwork from Minoan, you know

100
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,809
25 3,000 years ago, right?

101
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,890
So much of it. I mean look I've never thought that much of it

102
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:51,050
I always thought it's strange that we have this cultural need to cover that part. Like why is that it's it's here

103
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,850
Here's the thing

104
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,230
When something is normal, hmm, and you try to change it people want to go back to I wasn't normal

105
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,090
So, okay. So in this case, they're topless, right?

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,210
So they they get the point that they should be covered but they found a little loophole

107
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,230
So let's cut holes so the breasts don't hang out anyway, because that's normal for us

108
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,270
But whoever saw that who would have provided the t-shirt so they'd be covered. Well, I'm sure it was like, oh my gosh

109
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,170
They're not normal

110
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:23,130
You see so this normal thing is very rare here. Let's just cut to the chase on this topic. Mm-hmm. Okay

111
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,750
People have gurus either call them

112
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:33,190
What did I call him ascended masters a very special humans geniuses, whatever, whatever, whatever that people aspire to

113
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,870
Sure. Yeah

114
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,610
There's a whole bunch of them right

115
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,870
Prophets or whatever that do special things and people aspire to the achievements of these people, right?

116
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,230
That is still part of the culture that is still part of their culture is they're not doing any

117
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,230
They they're doing things that are special because it seems different to the norm

118
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,810
What if you went to a culture where everybody walked on water? Wait a second. That's called Iceland

119
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,770
Anyway, you see

120
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:09,150
Okay, maybe it was Greenland that was actually I see a nice green. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, there are no trees in Iceland

121
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,710
No, I heard really. I never heard that. Okay. Yeah, but anyway, so you see what I mean?

122
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,770
It's a struggle back and forth. So that's why I always said I'm the stuff wouldn't be covered relationships

123
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:26,730
Uh, almost three quarters of decades ago on the original OMG and I said look just pick someone it doesn't matter

124
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,750
Don't you know TV Hollywood thing, whatever, you know, they and start working with them and build it up

125
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,170
But guess what? Guess how are you gonna build it? Let's say you build a

126
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,830
Structure you're gonna build it according to the architecture that's accepted in your culture, right?

127
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,610
If I show you a picture of Chinese architecture, how long does it take you to figure out though?

128
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,070
That's in China mostly like a second, right?

129
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,550
Yeah, but you're gonna need a lot of contingent parts that share commonality

130
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,630
See, that's the thing about if you're gonna build a structure

131
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,030
Look, you're not going to do it with one piece of wood one piece of plastic, you know one piece, etc

132
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,750
Etc. Are you know, you're going to come up with a bunch of contingent pieces that have some common

133
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,410
Properties so this is the way that you would build something even if it is foundationally

134
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,610
Something you got to start from scratch. Yeah, we did get into it

135
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,670
Law form and law is not people you say well

136
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,110
That's like tax and traffic lights and stuff like another law form covers it your entire operating system and your entire program

137
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,750
So right because there are similar law form then you're good. Well as we talked about and plainly, all right, look if

138
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,350
Okay, if one of us was a female

139
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,550
It is just what we'll do one of us was a female and we were trying to come together on this

140
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,110
We would sit down talk about it and say okay. Look I eat certain things. Do you eat these things?

141
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,670
you know and I mean we'd have to eat similar foods we'd have to agree that a a

142
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,030
Housing is particularly acceptable or not. We'd have to agree

143
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:58,070
Okay, no, I gotta stop you there. Okay. I'll show you how fine this is. All right, it's not what I eat

144
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,770
It's what I ate now. What are you going to eat in the future?

145
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,630
You see you have to put the tenses together

146
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,290
well

147
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,470
what I eat is what is currently happening because what I ate in the past is almost irrelevant because I

148
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,370
Last meal you once you have a conversation like that

149
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:14,610
Yeah

150
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,310
You are willing willing to work together the last meal you had is the last meal you had

151
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,330
Based on what you're going to do now

152
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,690
Well, I always thought that's why when people dated this is why one of the dating rituals was to go to eat together

153
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,130
So this way you could learn

154
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,610
Whether you know you were compatible in some way. I thought that was a common sort of thing, right?

155
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,410
Isn't that why you engage in certain forms of entertainment to see?

156
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,810
Okay. Look, are you a movie person? Are you somebody who likes to go see music?

157
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,930
whatever and you might find common entertainment so that you can pass some of your

158
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:53,890
You know downtime together a little more culture East Coast culture American culture Western culture. Yeah

159
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,130
It's nothing

160
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,690
It's nothing

161
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,950
Here this goes

162
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,530
Depends on how simplistic you want to keep it. You know, someone says what's your favorite food?

163
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,610
What's savory sweet? I never have a good answer for that. What is your favorite food? It's like well, it depends

164
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:19,630
Well, I can't be but there's so many tastes in in the palate that you can't lump them all together and say there's one

165
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,950
Food that covers all the taste. Well, right like today

166
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,230
I might really want a sandwich Greek and that could be my favorite food for today. It doesn't mean that next week

167
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,790
I'm not sitting here wanting to eat a

168
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,170
God help me. I don't eat chicken anymore because it's all disgusting

169
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:38,710
I can't find a decent piece of chicken, but I used to enjoy chicken. I used to enjoy a good piece of beef

170
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,030
When I can get a hold of something that is of decent quality

171
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,110
I still do enjoy it

172
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,490
But I mean, you know there might have been a time where I ate a lot of cheese

173
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,270
There might have been a time where I was all right, but that was all the time

174
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:56,930
Yeah, but you mentioning the foods, but I'm suggesting that they go into a category regarding the palate. So you have a palate that has various

175
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:04,470
receptors and sensibilities and sensitivities and every subject can be taken that way, right? Sure. What's your favorite color?

176
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,990
Well for what but right it depends are you talking about my clothing or are you talking about what it what color I like my

177
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,150
House to be because I I don't I like wearing black clothing. I don't want my house painted black, you know

178
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,850
Good I found a study that was done in the 80s and it was one of these Ivy Leagues and they found out by

179
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,250
Testing people not muscle testing, you know, that's more

180
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,950
Whatever, but I found that if you put

181
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,670
People in a pink room for more than four hours their actual muscular strength decreases

182
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,490
You know what they could lift or prefer, you know perform on a maximum level goes down very interesting, right?

183
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,910
So the paint the prisons pink, let's say right. Okay, kind of it shouldn't be any prisons by the way

184
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,710
There's no, you know, that's unlawful by the way to put someone in a cage

185
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,210
Of course and the colors on the interior walls of things do affect the inhabitants if you're constantly exposed to it

186
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,990
If you're constantly exposed to different colors that affects you that's another discussion for another day. Actually, I think

187
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,350
By the way, no pun intended when you have a grouping of colors with color palette. Yeah, right

188
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:15,650
Yeah, so again, it's a matter of variety. By the way, I think on this sonic maybe I want to go back and do some

189
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,710
scrubbing on the rubbing and scrubbing and leaning on the chat because

190
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,610
We do these sonics. We refer to the chat and there's a couple of things that have gone

191
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,470
Right before we started recording I said, you know, some of these questions are a sonic in their own, right?

192
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,790
Right soon covered some degree before right? Okay

193
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:41,290
Yeah, you know the silver coin thing. I think you brought up, but I think we covered that for people that understand

194
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:48,010
Silver has been used historically for its attributes. It's more than just for health attributes, by the way, right?

195
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,590
That's it's the master metal if anyone that works with the metal crafts knows that you can pretty much break

196
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,350
He's not well, but attach any two pieces of metal using silver in between, right?

197
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,390
It's a go-between you almost all things except for aluminum and bismuth and things with a low melting point

198
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,510
Where you couldn't do it. Otherwise, so

199
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,550
That's why I'm fine fine frame building

200
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,290
They use you know for automobiles or bicycles and motorcycles that back in the day

201
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,470
They did silver brazing instead of brass brazing is lower temperature blah blah

202
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,570
but the silver thing is this to get energy if you're chasing the energy of the silver see the

203
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,150
Current scientists will tell you if there's no presence of matte material there. There's no effect, right?

204
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,010
So that's a wrap but the people use silver historically against

205
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,890
Let's say on utensils against their body and in jewelry, right? Yes

206
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,690
And it's been very here's an example how when you go for the materials very dirty

207
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,170
I don't remember people wore silver rings and earrings. I left the tarnish on the skin, right?

208
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:52,010
It's not very sanitary looking and it's not very sanitary either. So the whole idea with the aqueous Argentum

209
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,130
It's not colloidal silver because there shouldn't be any kool-aid just means very small particle, right?

210
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,250
You know, but you know when you see dust, you know

211
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,690
We turn on a bright light like it's a a film projector back in the day or a projector and you see little particles

212
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,030
In the beam of light. Yes. Those are called kool-aids. Yeah, they they say right I always thought of it as dust

213
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:14,430
But yeah, yeah, it's almost in a colloidal state actually what keeps those fibers some some fibers look pretty big actually

214
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,010
It's electrostatics the same way spiders cross the Atlantic Ocean

215
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,130
Well, that's likely a bunch of small things that are pulled together into a clot or a you know clump, right?

216
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:30,090
Yeah, or dust a really small dust bunny will stay up because of electrostatics. Yeah, you know spider wet spiders back in the day

217
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,690
I don't know because

218
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:37,650
There's a lot of things have changed is they they jump off a tree and while they're jumping they shoot a long thread out

219
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,410
that

220
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,630
Web material where we were called spider silk and once it got electrostatic

221
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,290
Up about a thousand feet into the air if they're in New York or Jersey within about a week or so

222
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,730
They ended up in Paris, France

223
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,470
Yeah, interesting. Yeah, they kind of like flew it was electrostatically. Yeah electrical charge

224
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,830
Yeah, it's a fascinating fascinating thing. Usually not covered in your average biology book, by the way. Yeah, there's no material aspect

225
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,810
No material electrons. Sometimes I'll see a videos or we know electrons have mass. I'm like what?

226
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,830
What so what scale did you put them on I don't get that yeah, it's just the brainwashing and the convention is ridiculous

227
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,730
Really out of place even to say that but that's what they accept. So again with the energy with the silver

228
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,570
There's an energy that's being emitted from the silver. How do you push it? It's gonna stay with the silver, right?

229
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,830
That's what it does and in water. So it's going to the energy

230
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,570
Anybody's guess a really sensitive person a really good dowser that can speak

231
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,430
Arithmetically with measurement and metrics can tell you. Oh, yeah

232
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,410
the fielder on that silver coin in the water is half an inch or an inch or it goes to the top of the bottle some

233
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,830
Sensitive people could pick up on that, right?

234
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,350
Well, how do you get it off the field the field energetically into the water? You need to give it a little push

235
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,530
Right. So a little bit of electricity biological amount DC very tiny amount

236
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,190
Will agitate the silver enough and satisfy the surface of the silver

237
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,030
To release the field into the water you see. Hey, you know what?

238
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,630
This sounds like this sounds like if you took a electronics technology class on how a magnetic tape head works

239
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,090
You know if you run magnetic cassette tape or VHS or whatever does

240
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,530
Yeah, if you run it by let's say you open up the VCR or the tape deck and you start turning everything by hand

241
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,250
Moving and all that are you recording or playing anything? No, because guess what?

242
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,810
There's no plugged in no electricity. Yeah, you have to be plugged in for it to work, right?

243
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:46,730
So, you know again do that experiment what we're talking about is is already been accepted in a different field known as

244
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,090
Magnetic actually, wait a second aren't hard drives magnetic. Also. They are aren't they?

245
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,230
Yeah

246
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,710
So

247
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,770
It's exactly like so let's say you put the cassette tape in the cassette deck and you start

248
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:06,150
Turning the spools or anything by hand. There's no music. There's no sound if you try to record. There's no recording, right?

249
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,750
What happens that electricity allows a train energetic transfer? There's no materials. No electrons, but right? Okay, right

250
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,510
So this is what we're doing with the aqueous urgentum. I think it's freaking brilliant. Why?

251
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,730
Because you're not using any of the material which has the side effects, you know

252
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,290
In other words once, you know, the body works under induction nothing goes to your intestines and the body reproduces it

253
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:33,230
So think about this if you're taking colloidal silver that actually has the particles in it and your body wants to reproduce it

254
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,410
It's gonna have to reproduce physical metal inside the body. Do you know how much energy it takes to do that?

255
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,290
Well a lot right a lot. Yeah, so think about it just needs to reproduce the field. Well, that's great

256
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,850
That's what we do here. Anyway, it says right and it produces the field like crazy

257
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,870
Could you be using it just a little bit though

258
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,910
I mean in such a minuscule amount that it's barely noticeable and therefore it's acceptable

259
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,350
Couldn't that be a possibility or or is it?

260
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,830
No, you mean the colloidal or the aqueous urgentum the aqueous urgentum to where it's such a yes or no. Yes

261
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,410
No, that's in the advanced discussion there. The preparation like homeopathics is very important

262
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,750
There's some videos and how homeopathics are prepared to go through a certain process. It's not material

263
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,630
It's like they whack the bottle with a paddle that's got rubber then they whack it with something else

264
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,870
and they store it a certain way they right right so there's a

265
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,410
Preparation and I would be lying if I said I know how to make a more advanced preparation without it

266
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,390
You know advancing the the skill without me experimenting with it and then having a way to measure it

267
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,610
But I what I have measured and I do know is that it is far superior in every way

268
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,570
For the application of silver to biological or body then the colloidal silver

269
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:52,850
Right, so again, I think the if anyone questions is the easiest analogy is a magnetic magnetic transfer of information

270
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,470
Hard drives magnetic tapes

271
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,590
videotapes

272
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,530
Exactly the same way. I actually like exactly the same way in every way

273
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,310
You know, imagine you make colloidal silver and you start hearing the Beatles white album or Metallica, right? I'm not saying that

274
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:15,510
Right or or watching a porn or whatever, right so it's energetic transfer look it's energetic transfer

275
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,450
It allows it allows, you know, again, it's it involves when it comes to the videotape. It involves light, too

276
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,470
But you know, yeah, the energy is in other words

277
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,790
You could play those tapes they will physically wear but as long as you're getting the information off of it

278
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:34,090
There's nothing material there, right and the same thing with the aqua sargentum

279
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,330
You don't want any material as such

280
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,710
Present and

281
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,590
Yeah

282
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,250
Okay, we'll talk about that soon. I think maybe not tonight or maybe in the next week or so

283
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,610
we'll do the

284
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,470
Giveaway, we'll have someone picked out that gets one of the finalized kits the standard kit, right?

285
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,410
I'm just taking a lot of work for me to do but it's worth doing and I'm just sorting

286
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,650
I'm just sorting a way to absolutely randomize the selection. So

287
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,410
Yeah, that's all I'm doing yeah, I've gathered everything and run enough experiments to be pretty happy

288
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,650
with something that

289
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:17,610
You know, we can keep making it and it'll be the best possible way to make aqua sargentum and it's called silver made easy

290
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,570
It's a USB connection

291
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:27,450
Okay, so you don't need bat, right? You don't need batteries or transformers and USB I think is more prevalent than anything else

292
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,210
You're right. You go to Starbucks it at the counter. Guess what? They have a USB outlet right there, right?

293
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,210
Oh, yeah, actually, I bought a lamp recently brand-new lamp. It's got a USB port in it. It's just a regular lamp

294
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,930
Yeah, so wherever you go, you get it. You'll probably find more USB ports in your travels then

295
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,690
You know if you're in a car, it's 12-volt this if you're in a house, it's mains whatever they are

296
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,790
But you know, hi, you know, so yeah

297
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,450
You don't need batteries this way and and it's done a certain way that it filters out anything

298
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,730
Because you know to get the power of USB

299
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,310
The computer runs on DC and that creates an AC

300
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:10,330
Current which is then dumped down inverted back down to DC. So you get these crazy waveforms in there. It's called ripple

301
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,570
So I've managed to design and set up a wire that eliminates that as a matter of fact

302
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,430
I think he's a sub

303
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,990
Someone I got some of my speakers more than a year ago

304
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,810
And I then after that I sent him some wires that I made

305
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,110
And so what do you think of the wires and he says oh as soon as I put him in there?

306
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,390
Everything sounded louder and clearer, you know at the same volume, right? So the wires do make a difference

307
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,770
Actually, they act as filters antennas

308
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,890
That's why if you're into audio

309
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:41,710
You want to avoid six foot length wires and it's funny when you go to buy speaker wires or they offer it in six foot three

310
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,010
foot

311
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,170
Planks, that's the worst because they pick up radio waves

312
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:51,970
At six feet you you want a little less or a little more stay away from the six feet or the denominations of six

313
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,050
You know in half or a quarter of six. No used to crack me up

314
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,630
I always knew when somebody had a cheap patch cord like if I was playing in a band somewhere because inevitably

315
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,770
on stage you'd hear all of a sudden a radio station coming through their amp because they were using an unshielded wire and it was

316
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,550
Like right and the wrong way if it's unshielded you could shield it by tying a few knots on the negative

317
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,590
Yeah on the ground, but

318
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:19,110
Yeah, so I just want to you know, this will keep coming up and here's the thing

319
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,490
This is the aqueous Argentum thing is a quality of life increase, by the way

320
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,350
It's not just about being a fungicide or a bactericide, right? It's invigorating

321
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,230
Right and at the same time if you're around people who are pretty clueless

322
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,170
which I'm sure mostly everyone is around people that are completely clueless and they just

323
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:43,090
Especially understand that this is something that could be administered in a spray bottle, you know, the last thing I discovered

324
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,550
I don't know if I brought it up if you got

325
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,790
Work clothes athletic clothes or towels wherever that have BO after they come out of the washing you have a clothes dryer

326
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:58,730
Throw everything in the dryer right right before you hit the close the door spray the aqueous Argentum over it lightly and watch what happens

327
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,830
It's amazing how it works, right?

328
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:09,030
So and it's so cheap because the silver will never deplete and right so well just a quick thought here

329
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,190
I don't know why I'm thinking this but you know

330
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,710
Some people use the colloidal silver the bottled stuff and they put it into like, you know

331
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,550
What do they call that a vaporizer machine, right and then they breathe in the vapor, that's fine

332
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,670
Well, that's fine because the vapor will leave the silver behind hopefully well

333
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,570
But that's the thing is I'm thinking to myself if you take it in. Okay, you're not absorbing anything in your lungs, right?

334
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:38,070
No, it'll it'll induce through the lungs. Of course. It will it'll induce but that's not absorption. I said absorb

335
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,630
No, there's no absorption on anything biological ever anywhere. There's a slight permeability

336
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,050
Okay, right, but when the skin gets soaked, right

337
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:54,970
Yeah, but that's because it actually has it's permeable. Yeah slightly but it is hydrophobic as a matter of fact

338
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,750
You know if something's hydrophobic when water goes on it it beads, right when it's not what it's hydrophilic

339
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,450
It just lays on top of the object like a full sheet of water

340
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,610
Anybody comes out of the water and they stand there for a minute that the water starts beating on their skin, right?

341
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,210
Yeah, of course. Yeah, so their skin is hydrophobic, but it is permeable

342
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,270
Permeable means able to pass to a certain extent

343
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:23,610
But if you look anything biological anything that's alive that is experiencing absorption ain't got long to be alive

344
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,250
It'll be dead pretty soon guaranteed

345
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,390
So and this is the thing. Let's go to the next thing

346
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,410
We I think you brought this up also and I caught it when you said it caught my the heart attack

347
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,670
What would cause right? Yeah, I think yeah, what is it?

348
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:42,050
Well, the question I that jumped out of me is what is a heart attack then because we were talking about the organs a few

349
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,150
Sonics, well many Sonics ago now

350
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:49,150
Yeah, go ahead. I comprehend the function of the heart. But what is a heart attack?

351
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,890
Clearly happens, but what is true cause and how could it be avoided? Okay, that's a sonic and it's on

352
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,130
I think I brought this up in piecemeal

353
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,930
Well, there's a lot of solo sonic

354
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,830
Isn't there a lot of answers to that though?

355
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,330
Because you have look you have an intake in an outtake

356
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,210
I mean there are chambers that take things in and chambers that take things out and if you have a

357
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,110
An imbalance in one, you know

358
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,270
One's not taking in enough or taking in too much or the other way around or it's you know

359
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,650
And not pulling it all out and some of it ends up sitting there. This is the problem, right? This is a

360
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:28,570
Bad pump. No, no, it's not a problem. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not mechanical, but it is mechanical outcome

361
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,710
Okay, it is a mechanical outcome

362
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,450
What's going on is the heart and simple is a breaking mechanism?

363
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:42,250
You that's why you'll never ever ever ever gonna hear about you hear about Chinese medicine and Vedic medicine

364
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,550
You're from the Hindu culture that you never hear about Greek medicine

365
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,770
Why because the Greeks said that the blood flows in a wave across the body up and down, right?

366
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,910
What and guess what when you translate the ancient Greek texts and you find out what they're really talking about

367
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,750
What they called the heart

368
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,590
Is actually the spleen

369
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,190
Hmm. Oh my gosh

370
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,670
Right, just like in ancient astrology

371
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,890
Venus was mercury and mercury was Venus. Oh my gosh, that's gonna throw you off a little bit, right?

372
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,970
Yeah, so once you sort that out, you can kind of make sure but they've done the same thing in the antithesis

373
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,630
They're calling the spirit and the soul the same thing. They say what's the spirit? It's the soul. What's the soul?

374
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,550
It's the spirit. I mean, come on. What kind of Mickey Mouse crap is that?

375
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,270
So this has been going on, all right, so the heart is a breaking mechanism because

376
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:42,030
The natural pulse just like nitrogen. Our air is mostly nitrogen, right and they tell you it's pretty it's not a noble gas

377
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,910
But it just sits there

378
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,870
but it doesn't if you evacuate a vacuum tube and put slightly pressurized nitrogen in there with a

379
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,710
You've got even a super high voltage. You'll see it starts to pulse

380
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,130
Right nitrogen is a pulsing gas when it's energized slightly with either temperature or electricity

381
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,990
Now now here's the thing

382
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,330
Frank Chester's got a lot of good old videos about that were some of his old grainy videos

383
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,070
He shows that they say the heart's a pump and I made a pump like he had a 2x4 with a weight on it swing

384
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,670
On a hinge and hit and hit something that hit a hose with a plunger to push

385
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,590
You know something that was like blood down a hose. It wouldn't move more than four or five feet

386
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:27,330
Right, and I've done analysis with someone over Skype when Skype first came out

387
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,050
They had access to like a console FE analysis computer

388
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,910
You know where they were the it's a finite element analysis where they design bridges and engines and stuff

389
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,310
Okay, and we put in the blood is about 50 percent solids at ninety eight point six, right?

390
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,390
437

391
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,750
Celsius and and then we put in average 2,000 miles of blood vessels at point

392
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,250
Seven millimeter average or point three millimeter average. Yes, you do have that much blood vessel

393
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,950
Even the big fat arteries if you average them out, they the average length diameter is 0.3 or 0.5 or 0.7

394
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:08,190
Anyway, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, they said to pump through that to pump that you need a pump with 1,200 horsepower

395
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,150
It's only gonna go about 200 miles, which is one tenth before you have cavitation. Oh my gosh

396
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,770
1,200 horsepower whose heart is 1,200 horsepower and does one tip

397
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,730
Oh, this is told the biology, you know

398
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,890
I don't use that too much because all their stuff is stupid, right?

399
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,510
And the worst part is when you have people that sound smart that say stupid things

400
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,390
they're all over the internet and most of them are

401
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,950
Mainstream, but you have a lot of them in the alternative, right? I'm not gonna mention anyone like cliff high or anything like that

402
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,490
but but

403
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,430
I'm nothing against these people, but it's just like oh my gosh. Oh my god. Just shut the F up

404
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:51,750
But keep going because actually he's what they're doing is accommodating a certain audience that is looking for that crap

405
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,730
So they're stuck in the loop a job dog chasing its tail not to BC

406
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,170
It'd be smirch a dog chasing its tail, which I think is a lot smarter than most people listen to him

407
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:05,210
But anyway, so I got nothing against him. I don't know the guy but jeez Louise

408
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,250
People stop telling me to go listen to cliff high. I mean, oh my gosh

409
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,430
I got better things to like the picking my nose. Actually, it's even better than I'll pick my neighbor's nose. That's even better

410
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:21,650
At least picking your nose. Oh, you know serve a purpose. Yeah, and speaking of picking you need to pick a better video. Okay?

411
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:30,350
So so what's happening is the body is in this pulsation mode and the capillaries are doing all the work when I say average

412
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,970
average

413
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:38,350
Vessel diameter is less than a millimeter. Does that sound like an artery? No, does it sound like a vein? No

414
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,830
Does it sound like a capillary? Yes

415
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:48,750
So guess what's moving all the blood right through induction, okay, and I've gone over this I'm confused of whether we've done

416
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,630
Okay, what happens is when there's an energetic transfer between the fluids and tissues to the capillary?

417
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,290
meaning materials becoming

418
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:03,530
Liquid and then gas and then energy going through the capillary to the other side or what I just said in reverse

419
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,770
If it's not in the capillary, it's energetic. It's material

420
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:14,810
It goes to a liquid the gas very quickly to energy and then it appears again inside the blood right in reverse

421
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,310
Okay, so when these processes happen, it creates a pulsing action based on we are not oxygen breathers

422
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:26,930
Sorry, if you think we are they people say we're oxygen breathers because we have an oxygen requirement. It seems right

423
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,150
We're actually nitrogen breathers because most of the air is nitrogen

424
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,490
Nitrogen and what I would just go over nitrogen is what it's a pulsing gas when it's what slightly energized

425
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,850
All this works so well together, you know

426
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,610
Just on a side note

427
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:49,910
We could show up at any medical convention University and just tear the pants off of anyone teaching anything

428
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:57,190
Regarding how the body works in like five minutes using their own stuff, you know that right? Mm-hmm. It's just crap. Okay

429
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,070
Well, what you just pointed out right there is just very simple. Yeah, so let's let's get back to what's hard

430
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,350
You can't have people raised

431
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:10,030
Like okay, what would happen if the culture of developed thousands of years instead of being developed around fire?

432
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,730
It was developed around magnetism. You'd have a very different culture. Absolutely

433
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,969
Okay, what if you have a culture where everyone understands how the body works that the things material things?

434
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,350
dematerialize and rematerialize on the other side of a membrane a

435
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,630
Non-permeable membrane

436
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,310
My gosh, yeah, so that means that we can do anything

437
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:39,989
Right, so you can't have that in this condition that the earth is in and the human society's in so what is a heart attack?

438
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,150
Yeah, all right. So it breaking let's go

439
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:47,469
Let's we'll address and now we address basically an overview of how the body moves the blood by the way

440
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:51,610
Yes, by the way, if you go study how platelets appear

441
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:57,590
Yes, they don't come from it they're stimulated depending on the conditions appear

442
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:04,010
You know when someone is they say when there's a wound platelets will develop they say they appear actually use the correct term

443
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,730
Well, and here's the thing about that. It's it's easily demonstrable because

444
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,830
Look, you donate blood or somebody draws a bunch of blood out of you the body replaces it

445
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,970
But I'm saying let's say there's a wound you look at bodily functions. I'm gonna be just continue this thought

446
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,570
Okay, I mean you will eventually nope. I'm just joking

447
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:30,030
What I mean is what they say when platelets appear in the blood vessel what happens to the blood vessel that dilates before it happens

448
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,050
Right because it has to move out of the way for these

449
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,690
Okay

450
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,170
So what I mean by this is look you ever watch Star Trek where they beam me up Scotty sure

451
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,950
Yeah, you ever see the transporters

452
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,870
They have all kinds of junk and stuff thrown in there or are they always clear because when they beam someone up they want them

453
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,490
To be beamed up on a clear platform, right? They need lots of room sometimes, right?

454
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,430
Okay, so when when platelets appear in a blood vessel, they have dilation

455
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,970
It doesn't say that they dilate so the platelets could come through the vessels dilate

456
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,850
Expand and then the platelets. What do they do?

457
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:10,170
They appear when you prepare 7-eleven or anything like you prepare a space like in the beaming

458
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,950
Explanation you prepare a space. Yeah, and then look yeah, right

459
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,910
So these things they're they're actually if you look at the language, it's trying to hint into you

460
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,870
You know, like, you know 9-eleven ground zero get it ground zero means atomic event

461
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:28,510
Anyway, it's the same thing. They use just a few terms that actually should be taken technically, right?

462
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,690
alright, so

463
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,130
The heart is a breaking let's just go so we discuss how things move in

464
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,950
Induction and blood vessels. It's the capillaries that I'd say are mostly responsible mostly

465
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,590
Blood flow, right? It makes most sense to right so

466
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,070
Now let's let's switch over to the heart being a break

467
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:53,810
Okay, anyone that has any kind of a brake mechanism bicycle stroller golf cart car

468
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,590
What do we know about that in order for the brakes to work?

469
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,810
They have a friction coefficient in other words when they're designed and made they have the optimum conditions

470
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:09,150
Usually let's say a car or bicycle the brakes are tested. They're made to work in what in the dry

471
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,650
What happens when you're in the rain?

472
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,810
They don't work as well

473
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,590
Friction goes down, right? Mm-hmm

474
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,730
Right. So friction goes down you slam on the brakes remember the old cars before ABS

475
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,310
They don't have any brakes, especially, you know big old car that was slightly worn, right?

476
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,390
Yes, that would happen a lot and with a bicycle

477
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:32,350
It's real simple because the you can see the two little rubber things clamp onto the onto the metal part of the tire

478
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,870
Well, if it's wet, it doesn't it doesn't grab it as well friction. Yeah

479
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:44,330
Okay, so how are what are ways to increase let's say you're always gonna be wet always okay because the inside of the heart, right

480
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,010
Always wet. Sure. Yeah, you know never said you have a dry heart

481
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,470
They always say you have a hard heart or whatever, but it's not on but never a dry heart

482
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,830
It might be a new thing colloquialism, but okay. Okay, so your hearts always wet

483
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,990
So then what's what's the other thing that determines?

484
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,470
Friction is the thickness of the blood thicker the blood you can have more friction like motor oil, right?

485
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,410
Okay, a lot in other words when a car manufacturer is being

486
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,270
Feels like they need to increase the MPG a little bit. What do they do?

487
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,710
They spec a lighter motor oil less friction, right?

488
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,830
That's a typical thing based on viscosity how viscous it is, right?

489
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,730
Okay. So what happens when you eat spicy food? It thins out the blood, right?

490
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,110
So you eat enough spicy food and you have other conditions that kick in

491
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,070
When that thin blood goes to the heart and the heart needs to act like a break

492
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:39,370
Is it going to be efficient or is a lot of blood going to slip through a lot of blood's gonna be less efficient

493
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,070
Because less efficient, right?

494
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:48,370
So what happens when you're not efficient with something it starts to go and there are intelligent systems in the body

495
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,850
That are checking back and forth and are like there's too much blood moving, right?

496
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,130
So you're you might feel agitated a lot of people before they have a heart attack. They have dizziness

497
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:03,150
They can't think clearly right muscle pains things like that. Yeah a bunch of warning signs, right, right

498
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:11,610
So essentially a blood that is too thin caused by eating spicy food. Yes. Spicy food is the number one in most cultures

499
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:17,930
Combined with other things emotional stresses and other changes in environment when the blood cannot be

500
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,490
Efficiently handled because that's what brakes do they handle the vehicle?

501
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,410
The

502
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,070
Heart can go into palpitation. It tries various things people just have a heart attack. They goes through various stages

503
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,210
It'll be a pain. They call it angina, right?

504
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:38,810
you'll have odd heartbeat and it'll normalize before you get a lot of signs a pain a pressure a

505
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,210
Flutter this kind of thing all these things happen

506
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:46,790
Yeah, you can trigger a heart attack with someone it won't be detected by a coronary if you use methylene chloride

507
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:53,170
By the way, that's a typical thing in prison by the by women have totally different warning signs from men

508
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,850
You know, yes, okay good because there are different species. They are. Yes. Yeah

509
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,950
within the same

510
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:06,610
Species, I wouldn't say subspecies. It would be superior in many ways sub and some other ways

511
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,970
It just goes back and forth right but men and women are complimentary species

512
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,530
Yeah, complimentary. In other words, we're cosmically we're on a scale equal

513
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,650
Certain things like if I needed a group of people that had

514
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,950
Strengthened their legs. I would pick mostly women

515
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,510
You'd be better off if I needed if I needed people with upper body strength

516
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,850
I would pick men to come for the task right like women more efficiently use water

517
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:40,270
Utilize water and and seem to have better hydration than men do in general until their water breaks

518
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,650
Yes, anyway

519
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,950
All right, so

520
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,070
So

521
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,450
So here's the thing here

522
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,210
What else thins out blood actually believe it or not?

523
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:58,130
Blood thinners is a calling for a lot of pharmaceutical drugs years ago. They used to call them blood

524
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,070
You need a blood thinner. You ever hear that? Yes all the time. Yes. I used to hear all the time. Yeah, okay, so a

525
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,530
Blood quality that is thinner than normal. I'm still this is not about addressing the

526
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,610
Energetic

527
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,590
This is just the physical quality of it

528
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:19,330
Which is caused by and food the energy from the foods also and what you intake there are chemicals that will do that

529
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,890
Is in a prison when they want to take out someone they died of a heart attack

530
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,990
And that doesn't show up in the court. They just put a little methylene chloride in the food. Where do you get methylene chloride?

531
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,930
Right, very simple. It's a very easy ingredient to find

532
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,530
And and it's tasteless odorless and small amounts. You don't don't need much

533
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,350
Yeah, so anyway

534
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,110
Yeah, don't want to get into more but anyway, I gave up the whole thing

535
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:49,810
So so this is what's going on with the heart attack simply. It's a break that doesn't stop

536
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,870
Now essentially I would steer everyone to directly to Frank Chester watch as much of his stuff about the heart

537
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:03,830
He does do about the chat the seven-sided figure that is lawful. He talks about that, but

538
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,750
It's a breaking mechanism

539
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:12,510
He also he was inspired to get into a deeply the geometry of an all of the heart from Steiner's work Rudolf Steiner

540
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,310
You have to say Rudolf Steiner Steiner. Yeah, so

541
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,910
You could look at that. I would highly recommend that

542
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,470
Also, you know the heart has it's more about mixing

543
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:30,170
It doesn't go in and out one-third of the blood stays within the volume of the heart to mix it, right?

544
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,570
Okay, and it goes back I never goes through the all the volume

545
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:39,630
It always keeps only two-thirds goes through at a time the hearts over empty in other words. Yeah your heart you have an empty heart

546
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,970
No one has an empty heart in this case. Yeah, at least two-thirds always one-third full

547
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,170
or two-thirds empty, so

548
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,010
So this is basically the mechanism like for example

549
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:57,430
If you look at Westerners Americans or whatever that adopt the diet, I like eating spicy food

550
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:03,250
Right if you look at their ear the bottom lobe of their ear just the very bottom part the cut

551
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,830
It's a part that's typically pierced for an earring

552
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,010
What's that doesn't it droop more?

553
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,110
Well, it only droops. It has a very sharp dimple in it

554
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,610
Like a cleft when that develops if you're around someone on a regular basis

555
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:23,810
Yeah, and you start noticing a very deep cleft developing in the bottom lobe of the ear. That's heart attack

556
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:29,610
Signal in other words, your heart is being taxed taxed taxed taxed and and it's interesting is

557
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:36,510
Right before the heart attack. It is really really prominent and after the heart attack it goes away. It's really if they survive it

558
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,410
So look for that as a sign

559
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,230
Another one is the tip of the nose turning red

560
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:50,630
By the way, that's almost like when you draw caricatures of alcoholics. They typically yeah, well because that does happen

561
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,910
Alcohol is a blood thinner all among Caucasians, especially you you will see a you know

562
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,550
That red or pink tip nose, you know, and sometimes the whole nose turns

563
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,570
Oh, you don't know black people black people blush and the tip of their nose turn they do tan in the dark

564
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,650
What do you mean Caucasians everybody knows my bliss? I'm just joking

565
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:14,590
I'm just telling you what I see is that I can't see on on on on people with more melanin

566
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,050
Okay, or whatever the hell is I cannot see it

567
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,710
Never get that right. I call some people black and say oh you call me black as a real Negro you call

568
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,250
I'm any girl. So anyway, I stick I don't know what to say

569
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,370
Melanated is probably better, but someone someone won't like that. Yeah, of course

570
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:34,250
I guess I guarantee somebody if I played this for everybody somebody would get pissed exactly

571
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,250
But no the red nose thing is common among alcoholics, and I think it's good

572
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,870
if you know someone

573
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,930
Physical emotional stress can cause that but if you see it reoccurring way, it's not part of their normal condition

574
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:54,150
Constitution. So again, or if you're just Irish, I mean in that case, of course, Irish drunk. Okay, so I'm sorry

575
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,670
If you're Irish, you got a lot more problems than that, but I'm just joking. No that too

576
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,650
But I mean Irish and drunk. I mean that's like saying, you know, that's a cliche

577
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,750
Yeah, well the word Greek is French for taking it up that you know, what we had this discussion

578
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,550
Okay, so I'm sorry I had to do it good

579
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,850
Well and the thing with the New York accent you 30 third and third, you know, I always I told listen

580
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:24,870
If you have a New York accent, no matter how smart you are, you can sound dumb. So stop it, right?

581
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,390
You know a real heavy accent, you know

582
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,650
Anyway, I try and pull back the the the Northeastern Jersey, New York

583
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,890
Sound in my voice a lot when I'm when I'm trying to do things where I'm explaining, you know

584
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,810
Things I was hired. Yeah, I hate that

585
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:46,550
See the connection to culture you see it's the culture. Yeah, you never grew up saying I want to sound like a New Yorker

586
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,870
No, not at all. But and the thing is I don't notice it

587
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,370
I end up going to other places and they go. Oh my god

588
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,890
Listen to you like they're sitting there laughing at me in Indiana because of the way I say coffee

589
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:02,690
Like I was coffee. It's coffee. I'm like what I didn't say like that. That's what they hear

590
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,470
I say coffee, you know, I was coffee coffee

591
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:15,130
It's not it's not and it's something that's beyond like I was once in the South and Jimmy John if he had a

592
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:21,370
Pickup truck with a rifle rack and two dogs in the back. It's not a it's sound just like the cliche

593
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:26,250
Yeah, and he says Greek you got to stay in the truck because I got to go talk Southern to them folks

594
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,650
Okay. Yeah. All right. That's no problem. You know, no matter what I do there was a giveaway, right?

595
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,630
So you see there's extreme conditions, right?

596
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,290
it's crazy because you know you and I hear that as if you and I sit in a

597
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,590
Frankly if you and I sit among some of those guys

598
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,950
You'll just hear stuff like he has getting off and going over down to town to boom, right?

599
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,150
And I guarantee you I just said something there, but you don't know what I said. No, I got it. I got

600
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,410
Jamaican is another Jamaican sounds like a completely foreign language

601
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:02,070
At least that sounds musical, you know, at least that's that's a gotta gotta, you know

602
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,910
It's got a bit of a melody to it. But I mean that Southern stuff. Oh my goodness

603
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,750
and and they think that we sound crazy because it's like

604
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:13,050
Anyway, and there you go culture again. It's all culture

605
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,570
Big so so anyway

606
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,930
The heart is a break

607
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:27,010
Let's just like we did a little dissertation on colloidal silver in the magnetic devices the magnetic tapes and hard drives same

608
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,690
Analogy same analogy here part is a breaking mechanism

609
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,970
Part is a breaking mechanism and guess what? The heart is also a breaking mechanism

610
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,450
Can that be can you consider it as a breaking mechanism because it is a breaking mechanism

611
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,110
They say the heart is a breaking mechanism. You certainly did

612
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,090
You know the last the last thing they hear though

613
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,510
I just want to ask you real quick and you're probably gonna scoff at me, but let's do it

614
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:53,450
Anyway, you know, I've studied a lot of these death certificates, right where they have these explanations of why it is

615
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,370
Someone has passed away and they they give a cause of death

616
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:04,010
I always I look every time I see, you know cardiac arrest as the cause of death. I look at it and I go

617
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,110
Okay, so this is somebody who was either lazy or didn't know what they were doing

618
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:13,970
Because that is never in my mind the actual cause of death

619
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,090
Because by the way when they use the word arrest, you know

620
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,450
If a cop stops you just to ask you what time it is if any any official

621
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,130
quote-unquote municipal government without

622
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:32,610
Claiming the government is too much but stops from your normal path or travel is considered an arrest

623
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:37,010
Yeah, when something is look a very simple arrested development. We've all heard this term

624
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,630
Well, that simply means you were on a normal trajectory

625
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,390
You were in motion in development or you're supposed to be in motion in development

626
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,530
And therefore it was arrested which means guess what a stop. Yeah

627
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,750
It's for any reason but here's the thing the the coroner used to be a very respected in high position now

628
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,930
It's just trashed through the street like everything else, right? Yeah in a lot of places in a lot of places

629
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,910
I mean as I know you don't you know hold much faith in doctors

630
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,850
But at the very least if the coroner was a doctor you might have a chance that they might understand

631
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,670
You know to be able to identify the organs anyways

632
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,450
Doctors you do have to have faith because it is a religion

633
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,190
Fair enough, but the thing is I mean at least they might have a chance at knowing what went wrong in the body

634
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:25,530
Maybe sort of you know, okay. No, they don't have a chance because they they were how did they how did they get their medical?

635
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,490
knowledge

636
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:33,010
Listen, it's pretty easy to understand that if the head was separated from the body that might be the cause of death

637
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,930
Okay, it's not hard

638
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:40,190
I'm just saying but when I see this laziness of cardiac arrest or heart attack basically being three

639
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:46,630
I always think to myself heart attack car accidents and what else but it's but it's nonsense because here's well

640
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:51,170
Here's the question. I have for you. Isn't a heart attack. Generally not the cause of death

641
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,950
Isn't that the thing that actually results from something else having gone wrong?

642
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:02,830
Like in other words, the heart attack is a symptom not the thing that did it usually I mean, isn't that the case or?

643
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,910
Yes, it is, but it could be accepted as a cause of death

644
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,890
I could see how it could be because you it's not a card attack

645
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,570
It's more like you killed your heart and the heart didn't do its job and it's breaking now. That's fine

646
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,330
That's fine

647
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,710
But what I'm saying is that the majority of the time and yes indeed there could be instances where that is the cause of death

648
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:27,170
I understand that but what I'm saying is the majority of the time how often I've seen that on death certificates

649
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:33,410
How often that is there as it's like listen idiot at any point in time you could list that

650
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,890
Okay, though it has nothing to do with the gunshot to his head. That's what did his heart stop?

651
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,090
No, I guess it's overused like the word virus

652
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:44,410
Doctor and they don't know they can't diagnose you real quick. So you have an unknown virus

653
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,310
You have an unknown virus, which is great because I literally just told you it's unknown

654
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,650
Which means I don't know what it is, but it's a virus. How do you know that?

655
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,330
Good question complete

656
00:50:54,570 --> 00:51:00,190
Ridiculous. So I think we're gonna get into the next part here on how the heart is a breaking mechanism

657
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,770
No, we did that, okay

658
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:09,310
Why am I why am I? Yeah, it's very important to consider it as such don't be fooled by the rest now

659
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,750
What is moving the blood is the pulsing action of what being a nitrogen breather?

660
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,550
We're not nitrogen breathers. Well oxygen breathers

661
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,070
Oh, really go look at the ratios and not when the majority of what it is

662
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,070
Look, if you agree that you're taking air into that area of your body, which is called the lung

663
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,890
What are you taking in if you look at the concentration far as I understand?

664
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,090
Maybe the measurements are wrong

665
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:35,050
But everybody seems to keep coming up with the same percentages and it seems to me like more of it is nitrogen than anything else

666
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,290
Is that right or wrong?

667
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,950
Yes, so we're nitrogen breathers, which is a pulsing gas

668
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:46,650
We have an oxygen requirement as a catalyst to get the nitrogen to become oxygen in the body in the in the lung tissue

669
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:53,270
So the the pulsing action of the natural pulsing action of the soul in the metabolism

670
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,390
Is regulated by the heart now, hold on. Let's go back to the brakes

671
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,770
I think we did mention

672
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,350
The heart is a braking mechanism, right? Yeah, we okay brakes

673
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:10,050
We mentioned the friction part only but you know, you're here's a the brakes didn't work because the brake lines were cut

674
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,250
Right for if electric. Okay. The other thing there is

675
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,990
Okay, there's a communication electrical impulse

676
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,030
It's secondary by the way that happens from other parts of the body

677
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:25,210
You know why a lot of dead people are found dead on the toilet old people

678
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:30,350
So they say dead people are fun a lot of very old people seniors that live alone are found dead on the toilet

679
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,390
Okay, there is a nervous

680
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:39,190
Nerve path and a pulsing electrical path that runs around the rectum goes back to the heart

681
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,110
Okay. Yeah interesting, right?

682
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:49,150
so a heart attack or a failure for the heart to do its job as a breaking minute mechanism can be

683
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:53,930
Induced electrically and electromechanically. Oh, by the way defibrillators, right?

684
00:52:55,030 --> 00:53:01,090
Can't say that words right now, but right when they try to revive someone know you said defibrillator. That was correct. Yeah

685
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,650
Yeah, okay. I didn't didn't feel like I said it right you did though

686
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:10,990
Okay, so you see maybe they should put one of the pads on the on their ass and the other pad on there

687
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:16,250
Anyway, oh wait and most people the pad on their ass would be right on their head or where would you put?

688
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,270
Oh, no. Anyway, sorry

689
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:24,930
Yeah interchangeable there now you're a part of the accuracy which one of these probes goes in your butt which one goes yeah

690
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:29,010
So there is a nervous impulse, you know electrocution

691
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,190
Electrocution stops the heart right that it does

692
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:38,210
Okay. So again, my brake lines are cut. Did we mention the heart is a breaking mechanism? We did mention I think so

693
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,750
okay, remember that and

694
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,250
everything in

695
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:50,590
The uncommon sense realm of reality because sense is uncommon right not common just any sense

696
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,110
Everything shows that the heart is a breaking mechanism
