1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,480
Gonna give the Greek a call and get a rated Y going here.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,680
That's what I'm planning on doing.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,780
Let's see what happens here.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,540
Bring up my Skype.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,300
Okay.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,540
And here we go.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,610
Holy crap, the ringer is loud. How you doing, man?

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,210
Yeah.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,050
Okay, let me see here.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,470
How do I sound?

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,070
This is the...

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,770
It's definitely the phone. I can tell.

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,870
You can tell?

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,970
We'll keep it. Keep it, right?

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,650
Yeah, it's not bad. Not bad.

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,810
All right. All right.

17
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,450
A little better. A little warmer.

18
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,530
I got up from a nap, too. I'm exhausted.

19
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,070
Gotcha.

20
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,350
I'm not exhausted. I'm just tired.

21
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,250
No worries. It's a little warmer than the...

22
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,870
The computer is a little warmer sound, a little more natural sound, but it's not a big difference.

23
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,430
It's okay.

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,690
All right. Let's see. I can rotate the mic.

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,070
This is a...

26
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,130
Oh, there you go. You just lifted up the quality a bit.

27
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,070
It's a post...

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,010
It's a...

29
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,670
I did a microsurgery.

30
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,130
And...

31
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,110
All right.

32
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,870
Let me see if I can get this thing rotated.

33
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,210
I'm usually more impeccable about getting stuff together.

34
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,530
All right. How's that?

35
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,290
Sounds good.

36
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,190
Okay.

37
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,910
Yeah. Improvement from before.

38
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,570
All right.

39
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,670
Yeah. Yeah. It was pointing towards the shirt.

40
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,370
It's a little tiny microphone hanging from the wire, which I surgically grafted.

41
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,090
Oh.

42
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,010
From another set that I like the microphone better.

43
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,550
It's better anyway.

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,570
Yeah. Excellent.

45
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,250
Maybe we'll do stuff.

46
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,010
All right.

47
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,370
All right.

48
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,090
Hey. Rated Y 42, I think.

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,450
And here we go. Ocelli in the Greek.

50
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,630
Real quick, I want to address something in the chat room real fast.

51
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,330
You guys gave me a couple of ideas about T-shirts and hats.

52
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,890
I promised to mention that to the Greek, and so I'm doing so.

53
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,590
Greek, first, how are you doing?

54
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,650
And second, I'll ask you about the T-shirts and the hats.

55
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,190
Oh, no. T-shirts and hats, please.

56
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,350
But, yes, do it.

57
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,710
I think it's part of the culture.

58
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,710
Just visiting, taking notes is fine.

59
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,490
I think I picked up on that.

60
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,570
Okay.

61
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:12,950
Yeah.

62
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,690
Just here taking notes, that'll work.

63
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,250
But just visiting, taking notes wraps it up a little better,

64
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,410
which I'd like to read an email also that was sent,

65
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,070
which is the common sentiment for many, many years.

66
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,370
But this individual's brain works really well on stringing words together

67
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,790
and gets the sentiment across.

68
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,690
Nice. Go ahead.

69
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,890
Yeah, that'd be great to hear.

70
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,410
I want to bounce back to the chat.

71
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,670
By the way, I haven't been around, and I went into the chat,

72
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,310
and I dropped in some pics, photos of some magnetic secrets.

73
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,830
Oh, that's what that is.

74
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,950
Okay, so that's that.

75
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,210
I didn't understand that.

76
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,150
I looked at the picture.

77
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,430
If you blow up the picture, it's self-evident what the two pics are, right?

78
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,230
Okay.

79
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,270
And you read the description.

80
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,990
But I wrote anyone with at least three sharpened pencils in their pocket

81
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,430
can figure out what to do next if you want to build what's called a magnetic motor.

82
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,850
And once you understand this,

83
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,070
you'll see why all the free energy motors don't work and will never work

84
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,950
and can't work, right?

85
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,030
Okay.

86
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,150
And that's all I'm going to say about it.

87
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,430
I think around what they called,

88
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,630
last time I had a discussion around what they called January

89
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,730
and the Pope's work schedule.

90
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,110
I'll talk more about the water.

91
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:22,930
Okay.

92
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,370
But up until then, I'm kind of bound by agreements to just keep it under wraps

93
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,890
because it's gotten to the point right now where it's just the stuff you see

94
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,970
and hear about that sounds like fantasy, right?

95
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,670
And it's gotten to the point where even if you had a device,

96
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,910
you couldn't replicate it.

97
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,130
Okay.

98
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,070
It's that sensitive and that much detail goes into it.

99
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,150
And there's nothing like it in the world.

100
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,950
And, yeah, the Greek thinks he's got a high opinion of himself.

101
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,150
No, it's not that.

102
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,510
It's just that I happen to make some extraordinary things.

103
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,830
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

104
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,790
I want to go back to what we were saying earlier and then back to the chat.

105
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,130
Gotcha.

106
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,830
But only extraordinary in that they are not ordinary literally

107
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,130
because people don't have these things,

108
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,530
but it's really practical knowledge that's applied properly, right?

109
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,730
They never will have them because they're looking at it the wrong way.

110
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,209
I see.

111
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,690
For example, I went on to a COMSOL, C-O-M-S-O-L,

112
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,330
their F-E-A, finite element analysis, where it's the program to get for engineers, right?

113
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,790
And you just put in all whatever you want to do,

114
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,230
and it shows you what's going on in terms of whatever,

115
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,250
stresses, materials, deflections, magnetism.

116
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,590
So I put in what I was doing, and it didn't show anything at all.

117
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,930
It just showed the standard conventional BS.

118
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,350
They're never, ever going to figure it out.

119
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,150
Never, ever.

120
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,370
I've discussed some of it online.

121
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,010
Because if you explain a principle to an engineer or a scientist,

122
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,010
and they want to go, let's say, level two, three, four,

123
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,670
where level five is industrially, you know, make it,

124
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,710
they're going to go to a computer, right?

125
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,970
They're going to sit down in front of, you know,

126
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,070
one of these CAD computers or, you know, F-E-A analysis.

127
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,670
Someone's going to do it.

128
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,970
Because I don't think you're going to get any 90-year-old engineers

129
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,370
that used to draw stuff with, you know, pencil and slide rule doing it.

130
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,890
So the minute they get on the computer and put the parameters in,

131
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,710
they're done.

132
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,090
They just killed the entire project

133
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,110
because the computer does not acknowledge what's happening here.

134
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,670
Does that make any sense?

135
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,910
Well, it doesn't make sense that the computer doesn't acknowledge it

136
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,270
because I thought, well, no, actually, maybe it does.

137
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,590
Because, you know, it only works with what parameters you put in it, right?

138
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,270
Well, yeah, exactly.

139
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,470
It's subject to human input.

140
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,310
And this reminds me of back in the early days

141
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,450
when they were doing computer graphics, they couldn't do water very well.

142
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,670
You know, like an ocean scene?

143
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,410
Oh, yeah.

144
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,630
Too complex.

145
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,090
It looked too fake, right?

146
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,330
This is different because they're not even acknowledging things

147
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,790
that are going on with, let's say, a magnet and water at all.

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,590
It doesn't even show the parameters at all.

149
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,530
So if the computer negates it, the engineer, well, anyway,

150
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,610
it's another discussion.

151
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,570
It's kind of funky because it goes back to reverse alien technology, right?

152
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
It's not alien at all.

153
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,010
Well, funny stuff to me is that, you know,

154
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,810
a lot of these guys who are supposed to be engineers in these fields,

155
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,310
they never account for magnetism when they're talking about electricity ever.

156
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,390
And I go, well, isn't that one of those things that just comes along with it?

157
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,210
It's just a passenger.

158
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,370
It's part of the equation.

159
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,250
It has to be.

160
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,910
Otherwise, right.

161
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,130
But here's the thing.

162
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,950
I'm not an engineer.

163
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,730
I'm not even I'm using magnets, but I'm not using magnetism.

164
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,970
It's like this.

165
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,650
You've heard me give the analogy in prior talks.

166
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,450
I've been saying this for three decades now.

167
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,610
Imagine, well, this society was developed around fire technology.

168
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:55,310
Right.

169
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,670
Right.

170
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,250
Imagine a society that was developed around magnetic technology.

171
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,610
But it's not so as you might think.

172
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,470
Go back to the society that was developed around fire technology.

173
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,450
So all of your technology is based on fire as the premise of production or something.

174
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,830
Let me ask you, when you're using and developing your society,

175
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,930
is everyone putting their hand in the fire all the time?

176
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,490
Well, of course not.

177
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,070
It wouldn't survive.

178
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,770
So what and the reason they're never going to figure out a society developed on magnetic technology,

179
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,510
because guess what?

180
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,470
They're putting their hands in the magnetism the whole time.

181
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,390
And the key is not to put your hands in the magnetism, to use the part that is not magnetic.

182
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:43,430
So the society whose technology is based on fire is using the fire in a certain way where they all survive it.

183
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,690
Right.

184
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,270
So right now, the society, this society is using the magnet,

185
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,310
the magnet in a way where they're not going to survive advancement with magnets.

186
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,970
That actually makes a whole hell of a lot of sense.

187
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,910
The utilization of fire has caused a great deal of progress.

188
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,670
So one could say that there were progressions at a certain point.

189
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:04,970
Right.

190
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,930
There were progressions from just, say, having nothing to fire.

191
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,970
And you could utilize fire to build things, to reshape, to mold, to change, to destroy.

192
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,370
Yes.

193
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:21,850
But this was a methodology that could be used to do everything from forging metal to keeping oneself warm.

194
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,690
And that's all great and good.

195
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,510
But it's more about when you don't utilize the fire and when you're able to not engage with it.

196
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,049
Well, you sequester the harmful sides, and they don't know how to do that.

197
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,770
By the way, it's not just fire. It's fire in the wheel.

198
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,429
Uh-huh.

199
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:37,789
Right?

200
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,030
In the other case, it would be the magnet and the toroid.

201
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,450
There you go.

202
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,850
Which is a donut, basically.

203
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,310
Yeah.

204
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,750
Which I heard the donut reference.

205
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,550
Yeah.

206
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,450
And I was going to say, that shape in that image that you put there,

207
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,310
that was the first thing that occurred to me, is that constant toroidal occurrence that seems to be...

208
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,910
Why don't you blow them up? I don't know if you can get them really big.

209
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,030
The north is a certain way, and the south side looks very different.

210
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,830
Same magnet.

211
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,450
Uh-huh.

212
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,550
So what's going on?

213
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,890
So you're looking for an imbalance, right?

214
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,270
If a system is in balance, and you ask someone to describe it, guess what?

215
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,430
It's static. It's not moving.

216
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:15,730
Right.

217
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,630
So the way you make a motor is by creating what?

218
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,350
An imbalance.

219
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,670
An imbalance.

220
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,830
How does a water wheel work?

221
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,450
Because there's an imbalance.

222
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,990
Yeah, there's an imbalance.

223
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,710
The weight goes in one direction, and therefore pushes the water wheel down,

224
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,330
and the other part lets go of the water, which lets it go up,

225
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,450
and this is the imbalance, which causes the motion.

226
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:32,770
Yeah.

227
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,150
Right.

228
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,090
If you put water on both sides of the wheel at the same time, well, now it's a fountain, right?

229
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,950
It's not a water wheel.

230
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,590
Now it doesn't do anything if it's perfectly balanced.

231
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:42,470
Right.

232
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,810
They're making magnetic fountains, is what they're doing.

233
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,210
They don't know how to make a magnetic fountain.

234
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,910
They never will.

235
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,610
There you go.

236
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,570
By the way, what I'm saying is regarding the surface society,

237
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,870
the surface-dwelling human earth inhabitants,

238
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,110
the black vanilla world, the black world,

239
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,470
the black projects underground, who knows what's going on there.

240
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,770
You can get an idea, and I think they've always had it.

241
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,370
So anyway, I get a little bit of smell of suppression, not too much lately.

242
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,750
Speaking of suppression and things of the opposite suppression,

243
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,510
someone also left, before I get to email, 618, the 7-ish of the 4th,

244
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,150
sprayed some aqueous argentum on a load of clothes and dryer,

245
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,230
took the shtank out of the windbreaker.

246
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,150
Good looking Greek.

247
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,930
Yeah, I got you.

248
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,470
Yep, that works.

249
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,590
I do it often.

250
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,070
I have been doing it often.

251
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,530
I have mentioned in another Sonic that, you know,

252
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,250
I just don't take anything for granted, right?

253
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,270
Don't take stuff for granted.

254
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,010
I've been doing things for decades that in passing I've shared with people,

255
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,950
like just trivial stuff, or they'll come over and see what I'm doing.

256
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,950
And I'm like, wow, what's this?

257
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,750
I'm like, oh, I never thought of that.

258
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,110
Oh, I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,410
So I was like, you know, a lot of the things I take for granted

260
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,070
that are like energy-saving, space-saving, economical, efficient,

261
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,270
I take for granted.

262
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,910
And I said, you know, these little things need to be shared, right?

263
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,630
Like putting soap in a spray bottle, my gosh, and diluting it.

264
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,430
You know, you buy dishwash soap once a month.

265
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,710
If you dilute it and put it in a spray bottle,

266
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,570
you'll be using less water to rinse it off.

267
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,430
It'll be more effective.

268
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,930
And you'll buy soap, dishwash soap, twice a year.

269
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,230
Well, the total savings of $5 will be, right?

270
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,290
Well, no, it's actually more for me.

271
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,130
And I'm doing that.

272
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,570
Now, there's something where I affected a change from doing these Sonics

273
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,770
with you where I went, you know what?

274
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,610
He's right.

275
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,410
That makes sense.

276
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,190
Let me try it.

277
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,990
And I already know that's going to be more than a $5 savings for me.

278
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,250
Yeah, I'm just giving the scale as low.

279
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,050
It could be more.

280
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,850
Actually, if you get the good soap, it could be $50 a year.

281
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,610
No, it could be.

282
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,310
The organic soap, you know.

283
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,250
Well, that's the next step.

284
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,550
Yeah, this is important because, you know, years ago,

285
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,750
especially in the 70s,

286
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,690
there was a lot of talk about cancer being caused by a lot of the chemicals

287
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,910
in our society, right?

288
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,410
More so than now.

289
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,630
Yeah, for sure.

290
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,170
Believe it or not, 70s, 80s, for sure.

291
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,730
There was a movement to go organic and, you know,

292
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,170
these chemicals and everything we use are causing cancer.

293
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,050
But here's a study.

294
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,430
You ready?

295
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,230
This was done by the Germans.

296
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,350
This was done by various other serious people, let's say, looking into it.

297
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,730
Okay.

298
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,130
Yeah.

299
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:23,650
Okay.

300
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,510
It is the chemicals introduced in the consumer products, right?

301
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,810
But specifically the fragrances,

302
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,330
specifically the fragrances is what's killing us, right?

303
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,210
Let's say.

304
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,030
Well, that kind of makes sense because of the way it's always been described

305
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,730
to me physically.

306
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,670
You get these little particles that get up in the air and end up kind of

307
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,770
making contact with you,

308
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,050
and therefore that engages your olfactory sense the way they always

309
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,830
explained it anyway.

310
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,190
Well,

311
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,470
it's actually the chemical constituents compounds that to make these

312
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,670
synthetic fragrances that are more dangerous than the actual synthesized

313
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,510
product itself.

314
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,170
Okay.

315
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,190
So in other words, we're talking about the price of dish soap.

316
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,130
It's get the ones without the fragrance.

317
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,670
Now, what I did state,

318
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,930
this is sounds really trivial.

319
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,470
Oh my gosh.

320
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,570
These guys are going to talk about soap for the next two hours.

321
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,170
No, we're not.

322
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,490
No,

323
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,170
the blue soap or the green soap,

324
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,490
the popular brand it's got a fragrance in it,

325
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,070
but it cuts grease really well.

326
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,470
Yes.

327
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:15,870
Yes.

328
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,390
So what you do is you get some of the,

329
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,130
the,

330
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,950
the airy fairy soap to do the organic one.

331
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,010
I forgot what it's called.

332
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,950
They even sold it at Walmart.

333
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,910
It's got no color,

334
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,430
no smell.

335
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:25,910
Yeah.

336
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,610
There's a couple of them,

337
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,870
but yeah,

338
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,090
there's,

339
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,750
and you mix them,

340
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,590
you mix them together.

341
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,130
So you do a squirt of the blue in a,

342
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,970
in a container of water squirt of the other one.

343
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,250
What the other one does is it breaks down the fragrance.

344
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,350
It does.

345
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,090
It breaks down the,

346
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,830
so the fragrance becomes more innocuous.

347
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,970
So not only,

348
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,050
not only does it not contain the fragrance,

349
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,970
but it actually breaks down the other one,

350
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,270
or does it just simply dilute it?

351
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,390
Yeah.

352
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,490
It mitigates the other one.

353
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:45,650
Yeah.

354
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,230
It breaks it down.

355
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,910
So it's not present or harmful.

356
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,230
Yeah.

357
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:48,870
Excellent.

358
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,470
Okay.

359
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,350
That's a big deal,

360
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,530
believe it or not right there.

361
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,230
yeah.

362
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,830
All right.

363
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,070
Well,

364
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,230
another thing to add to my regimen here,

365
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,670
because that's something,

366
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,170
look,

367
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,750
I was definitely interested in,

368
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,870
in more efficiently utilizing the stuff I'm buying one way or another.

369
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,430
Let's be more efficient about it.

370
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:04,710
I mean,

371
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,390
it's just only sensible given the economic conditions that I find myself in.

372
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,650
It's gotta be,

373
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,170
you know?

374
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,990
So yeah,

375
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:11,650
definitely.

376
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,150
Okay,

377
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:13,650
cool.

378
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:13,930
Yeah.

379
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,350
And there's others where we've mentioned,

380
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:15,890
you know,

381
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,090
the hydrogen peroxide,

382
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,530
you know,

383
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,450
as an oxidizer,

384
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:18,810
right?

385
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,250
Oh yeah.

386
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,090
It's safe,

387
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:20,650
you know?

388
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,690
So all right.

389
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,490
Email real quick,

390
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,690
because I've gotten thousands of emails like this,

391
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,050
but this one is really put together.

392
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,370
Well,

393
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,390
it really explains much.

394
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,510
I might leave out part of it,

395
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,230
but it's anonymous.

396
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,430
So wanted to send a brief greeting.

397
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,130
I'm going to actually,

398
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,210
I have to break.

399
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,170
It's kind of long.

400
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,770
So I'm going to break,

401
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,610
skip around.

402
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,910
Sure.

403
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,390
Wanted to send a brief greeting before I hit the sack here.

404
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,210
This pleasant evening at the land between we're okay.

405
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,790
Camping.

406
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,410
All right.

407
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,170
I just wanted to tell you that your weekly Sonics with Chucks are being

408
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,150
listened to personally,

409
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,950
and it's been for several years.

410
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,410
I'm able to put some of the basic suggestions to use,

411
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,470
always looking for crossover between you and a few others.

412
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,330
Clean some knowledge and wisdom.

413
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,970
I glean knowledge and wisdom from it's obvious.

414
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,670
Thanks to your bringing attention to that.

415
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,830
Our bodies are a closed system in which the body utilizes is inducted

416
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,590
where needed as food passes from mouth to anus,

417
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,190
that the heart is in the pump,

418
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,590
that the full moon is the new moon,

419
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,490
not the dark moon,

420
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,230
but the 12th month is February.

421
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,790
And occasionally there's a 13 month when the moon after the 12th is

422
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,990
smaller than the 12th moon,

423
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,390
the first and seventh being the largest,

424
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,670
that there are proper and lawful ways to conduct one's business,

425
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,550
that the USA wanted to receivership in 1933,

426
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,510
practical and helpful ways to use aqueous,

427
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,690
our gentlemen peroxide,

428
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,670
that children aren't kids,

429
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,290
that it's an insult to be considered nice,

430
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,830
a different way to consider scripture and many other practical,

431
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,410
ponderable things.

432
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,310
You're going into a little more detail about subjects.

433
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,610
You discussed there the last several months with Chuck and it's

434
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,150
appreciated.

435
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,330
I also think Chuck has been getting better,

436
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,330
better at carrying out as part of the dialogue,

437
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,950
which brings the main reason why I'm contacting you and so on and so

438
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,130
forth.

439
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,250
So compliments to both.

440
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,070
And it ends up with,

441
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,710
thanks for your offering with Chuck and to Chuck for the time being.

442
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,510
So thank you very much.

443
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,230
Yeah,

444
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:05,570
sure.

445
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,910
The body of that paragraph,

446
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,270
I think is really a good summary of what I've been hitting on lately.

447
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,730
So thank you.

448
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,230
Excellent.

449
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,810
And I'm always pleased to,

450
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,170
you know,

451
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:16,690
when,

452
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,070
when,

453
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,690
when I hear that I actually served a purpose during these discussions,

454
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,130
you know,

455
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,910
I appreciate it.

456
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:22,750
Yeah,

457
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,810
no,

458
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,670
it's not about that.

459
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,270
It's just,

460
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,710
I think that he put it together really well all around.

461
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,110
And by the way,

462
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,410
before we go on a different subject or subjects,

463
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,930
what about the shirts and the hats?

464
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:36,750
Yeah,

465
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:36,950
no,

466
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,610
no problem.

467
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,990
We can work that out.

468
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,110
I was just curious if,

469
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,130
cause a couple of,

470
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,390
I,

471
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,450
I got a couple of emails where people had said,

472
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:43,670
Hey,

473
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,570
you're doing shirts and hats for other shows that you're producing and your

474
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:47,930
show.

475
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:48,830
Uh,

476
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,950
how about Otelli in the Greek?

477
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,170
Why aren't you doing one for that?

478
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,910
And I said,

479
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,510
because Otelli in the Greek is not a show.

480
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,250
Right.

481
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,470
It is a simple answer.

482
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,150
That's better.

483
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,710
But either way,

484
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,830
some people like the idea of having,

485
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,110
you know,

486
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,109
things that represent something they appreciate.

487
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,790
Uh,

488
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,170
you know,

489
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,750
so I said,

490
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:04,990
well,

491
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,829
I guess I can discuss that with the Greek and see what he thinks about it.

492
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,670
And,

493
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,230
and,

494
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,450
and,

495
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:31,550
and,

496
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:31,650
and,

497
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,510
and,

498
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,790
and,

499
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,230
and,

500
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,510
and,

501
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,730
and,

502
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,110
and,

503
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,650
and,

504
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,130
and,

505
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,250
and,

506
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:21,350
and,

507
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,390
and,

508
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,550
and,

509
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,270
and,

510
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,410
and,

511
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,110
and,

512
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,530
and,

513
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:07,650
and,

514
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,630
and,

515
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:09,870
and,

516
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,690
and,

517
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:23,810
and,

518
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,070
and,

519
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,710
and,

520
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,250
and,

521
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,830
and,

522
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,250
and,

523
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,350
and,

524
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,230
and,

525
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,590
and,

526
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:58,750
and,

527
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:58,850
and,

528
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,990
and,

529
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,590
and,

530
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,110
and,

531
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,090
and,

532
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,350
and,

533
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,570
and,

534
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,090
and,

535
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:25,670
and,

536
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,770
and,

537
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:37,430
and,

538
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:44,890
and,

539
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,050
and,

540
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,150
and,

541
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,250
and,

542
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,350
and,

543
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,450
and,

544
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,310

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,110
and,

588
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,450
and,

589
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,470
Jokes about that kind of stuff in private actually that's what it's like

590
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,490
But when you put if you if you put a camera lights and a microphone space will deny the whole thing

591
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,530
So if you start dealing and going

592
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,770
Let's say a lot of the Greek speak stuff to a bank or to an attorney. You just walk off the chase

593
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,090
He's gonna deny everything

594
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,970
But once you get to know them they brag about it, right?

595
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:37,010
The joking yeah the joking to I'm telling you I mean, you know, they like my favorite one

596
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,070
I heard many times told many different ways. It's sort of like, you know

597
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,690
What's what's the difference between when you crack open, you know a Jewish guy's head and a Catholic said, huh?

598
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,090
You know what lost him open with a brick and you split him wide open and his head's totally open right out there his brains

599
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,450
Everywhere. What's the difference?

600
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,730
You know, I don't know

601
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,790
nothing

602
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,590
Okay

603
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,550
Why is money green

604
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,030
Because because did you take it before it's right? Yeah. Yeah

605
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:16,630
So now I heard that if you say Negro you're considered a racist or if you say Puerto Rican, you're considered a racist

606
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,890
well, I don't know why Puerto Rican is racist and

607
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,890
American racist they still use Negro as I think

608
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,590
People crazy and by the way, this is all set up. You know, I've been saying this for a long time

609
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,130
You're being set up the whole way. There's no power shift. It's the same people playing with you, right?

610
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,850
Oh, yeah, they just give you a different different, you know, fable now is to turn your attention to but the truth

611
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:47,710
Well when it's being ultra conservative and religious, it's the same people but they're gonna say oh no these people not took over. No, no. No, no

612
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,910
It's the same stuff. He was me too. Here's the new boss. Same as the old boss. Oh always

613
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,070
Yeah

614
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,070
I mean the same people that were telling you embrace your sexual freedom or the very same people who said we should go back

615
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,410
Where you don't

616
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:09,790
Engage in your sexuality and well, that's why I say before you go, you know, the purpose of life is to be alive, right?

617
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,410
That's like there's nothing else to it

618
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,250
I think I've gone over this many many times where if you read all the ancient writs other than being

619
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,030
Contemplative and let's say worshiping your God and respecting your God

620
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,230
what is the

621
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,370
Systematic, let's say the the whole thing. That's that's

622
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:33,390
Basically the subject of life is agricultural based to have food and have clothing to have shelter and be happy generally, right without pain

623
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,110
Be reasonably, you know

624
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,150
Healthy, you know, but not in that way that most people think anyway

625
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:47,210
Right. It basically it's just being alive, right? It's all agriculture. It's all food food clothing shelter based, right? Sure

626
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,090
So so basically the purpose of life is to be alive

627
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,530
That's it right so here's the thing if you're being

628
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,450
Subjected to these things mentally don't you want to kick them in the shins at least once before you go?

629
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,250
And the way you do that is by you know speaking about it, right?

630
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:12,930
And and not participating. That's that was the greatest by the way the greatest

631
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:20,510
What is it? I don't like bringing up Gandhi because he's not who people think he is wasn't in character even

632
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,210
But not participation is the greatest

633
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,650
Resistance, right?

634
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,190
So right

635
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:35,430
But some things are seem unavoided but doesn't mean that you have to completely endorse we've got over this with the draft

636
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,630
When they had a draft people thought it was not voluntary. It was voluntary, but you just don't know where it's not voluntary

637
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,670
the same with court people just don't know where it's

638
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,830
Not voluntary, right? I got I've gone over both of those. So

639
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,810
Yeah, anyway, cool. All right anything else in chat, by the way

640
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:03,850
I think you covered it all much as I can remember for sure. I'm looking back now. Just take a quick look

641
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,570
No, I think I think you pretty much got it all didn't you let's see

642
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,390
Yeah, I mean your email you took care of that. So, okay

643
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,950
Let's see. We kind of ended we got into some of the questions about

644
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,570
Last week

645
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:28,150
Which were we got into depth towards the end of it basically about how the the energy works, right? How silver?

646
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:36,070
Yes, basically taking the energy off the silver the way you take the energy off of one magnetic tape to dub another

647
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,390
By the way, let's call biasing

648
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,950
You know if you remember the old tape decks that had their bias current had to be adjusted, right?

649
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,610
That's but when you buy something it's an extra push, right?

650
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,310
Yeah, I think we got into that and I didn't get any response on that but I think the the message was pretty clear

651
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:58,370
No, I think that was absolutely clear. You described energetic transfer as opposed to physical transfer

652
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,670
Where you know, you literally have to take a portion of something off of something in order to deliver it over

653
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,210
You push it with other energies. Yeah, but this can all be done with the mind by the way

654
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,790
But that makes it

655
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,630
People people have too much of an inferiority complex and a low self-esteem

656
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,670
I'm just saying it plainly to think that they can do things with their mind when they're doing them. Anyway

657
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,750
You know what? I mean?

658
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:24,890
so

659
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:32,490
In other words your emo and your mind affects things, but we did they don't feel that they're significant enough literally

660
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,590
I mean this literally well a lot of people directly attract

661
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,290
I mean, I know you don't like any of that stuff and neither do I that whole you know

662
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,810
The the concept of what do you do you attract things to you?

663
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,790
But the truth is you do you do and you don't you okay?

664
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,650
I've been in a situation for years where I figured if I changed my mindset

665
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,570
about it

666
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,190
That those things would not happen. Let's say a negative thing and they just don't still kept happening

667
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,830
right and

668
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,870
Because it's just part of you got to see is it is a format in the program of the construct that we're in

669
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,430
Or is it something you know what I mean?

670
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,830
But but quite often you don't need to encourage things to come to you

671
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:16,010
And and this is what the the trouble is a lot of times people do actively encourage

672
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:24,950
Certain things to come to them is certain problems certain patterns patterns. They're formed patterns, and they don't know what they're doing basically

673
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,170
it's kind of like

674
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,210
Patterns it's the way you look if everyone has a New York accent you all sound pretty normal

675
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,270
But the moment you leave New York you sound pretty fucking stupid right well you sound definitely different

676
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,890
The people from Indiana, I don't know if that was on air or off air

677
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,430
But I told you about it, and they were just cracking up at the way. I said coffee

678
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,090
You know because yeah, well there's different ways you could tighten that up coffee or coffee. Yeah, well

679
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,970
That well they were

680
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,330
Indiana but either way a coffee, and I'm like oh that sounds bizarre to me

681
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,970
You know and they they're like no, that's like a New York thing, and I'm thinking to myself

682
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,790
That's just the right way you say it just coffee

683
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,110
It's not right, but the patterns you see if the patterns fit if everyone is in a similar pattern

684
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,310
Manifestation that's where the normalcy comes in that's what Greek speak has all been about is due to

685
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,490
Objectifying patterns basically and

686
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,750
Methodologies and concepts and words and all that stuff right, but words not in the way that people use them

687
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,410
But in the one in what there's and how they were supposed to be used

688
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:39,230
And literally supposed to be used right otherwise the reference manuals go away the other thing is the concept of time I?

689
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,430
Had a discussion with someone recently about it. I'm gonna make this just interjection really short

690
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:52,290
The way people always refer to time is with some kind of scale right years months seconds hours minutes, right of course you begin

691
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:56,770
Yes, it's it mentioned at the end of the sentence, but yeah, it's literally what it frames

692
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:04,470
It's a scale the measure so sure so a tape measure doesn't do anything right until you start using it against something else

693
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:10,170
Right of course, but what is the tape you got a tape measure in your pocket or whatever it has no value at all

694
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,290
You know in itself as a scale

695
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:20,890
It's when you start comparing it you're right on op physical objects so time scales have no met no worth

696
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,210
until you start

697
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,870
Comparing them and including them as a function of an event

698
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,630
This went on for this long right or this happened then right so this is what some people say

699
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:41,650
There's no time yes there. There is there are events and the way we record and memorialize events is using time scale

700
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:48,430
Right right, so that's it. It's very simple, and it's it's kind of like the soul in the spirit really hard for people

701
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:56,670
If you have a Catholic upbringing or a Jewish upbringing the soul and spirit part is very very difficult to accept

702
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,750
Why?

703
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:06,470
Because subconsciously those two cultures were quote-unquote religions. Yes have indirectly drilled into the people that this is

704
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,090
Something that you're supposed to hate, but you're supposed to say you like it meaning their religion

705
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,410
It's interesting that and now let me branch out a little further sure you always hear about how Catholics and Jews

706
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,610
Have a guilt trip kind of mindset right? Yeah, I just broke down. Why they're made

707
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,330
To hate their religion in the culture, but they can't say it

708
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:34,610
They always have to say how they associate with it right and how they like it and how they identify themselves with it

709
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:39,210
Yeah, that's it has to be something that they own and owns them simultaneously

710
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,070
Yeah, but they they're brought up in a way that it's it's hateful

711
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:49,250
I mean not hateful to others hateful within its own self full of contradiction because none of it applies to anything that it's supposed to

712
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,190
Be based on well something that I'm forced to own and also is forced upon me to own me

713
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:58,230
I gotta say I would develop some resentment of it. Whatever it is you know

714
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,570
Personally maybe I'm taking it too personal

715
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,810
That's not what I mean

716
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:14,730
In other words the culture and the religion and the way that it's administered and procured to the population on every level whether it's a

717
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,530
Conservative or liberal group. Yeah is internally designed to be quote-unquote schizophrenic

718
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,409
I'm not going to use the psychological terms here in other words where?

719
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,570
It's you know the idea like you tell someone you love them in a minute later

720
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,670
You punch him in the face, and you say oh, I'm sorry

721
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,010
I love you, and then you punch him in the face like well. Oh my gosh now

722
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,429
Associating love with being beat up well

723
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,389
It's more about duality than schizophrenia because schizophrenia is not really that much about the contrast

724
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:49,370
Say is when you bring up anything that might even slightly have a lick of religious connotation to it

725
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,429
That's someone who has a Jewish or Catholic upbringing, but like for example if you bring up

726
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,330
This is again the soul and the spirit definition

727
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,530
Mm-hmm

728
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:05,910
That's doesn't when you say soul and spirit doesn't have a little bit of a licking of a religious connotation slightly slightly yes

729
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,590
Anyone who has a Jewish or Catholic upbringing will resent anything you have to say, but they'll let yes you to death yeah

730
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because this is how they are right like for example no matter how

731
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,330
the JES you it right or the

732
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:27,010
Being kosher no matter how adherent there that you start discussing that from a biblical point of view oh, no

733
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,170
To do with what I'm doing you see

734
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,310
So they're kind of crazy, and you have what between Jews and Catholics would you say about a billion people?

735
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,030
I don't know maybe yeah, yeah pretty close pretty pretty fucked up

736
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,510
You asked me, and how do you how do you fix them?

737
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,370
I don't think you can't you can't fix anyone they have to want to fix themselves good luck with that

738
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,170
Well, that's the other problem is I think both of those

739
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,590
persuasions from what I understand

740
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,010
Definitely imply that you you begin in a bad place

741
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,390
I mean before you even have a conscious thought or take an action which you have

742
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:09,100
Taken of your own volition you're already. That's a fail. Yeah, it's not it's a failsafe that was put in

743
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,090
Early on humans were quite advanced

744
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,970
And they started advanced you know they started that way and they were destroyed and on and on and on

745
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,770
And the cycle keeps good archaics is a good place to look up the chronology on that

746
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:33,590
So the last iteration that we've witnessed now was to make a dumbed-down version that can be used not necessarily as a slave

747
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,790
But yeah, they're happy with being owned you can tell them they're being on don't rub it in their face

748
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,130
And they think they that the world is theirs

749
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,870
Also that you could play with in other words

750
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,990
You know toy soldiers you know some of the back in the days

751
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:54,570
You know the little plastic figurine toy soldiers right right I don't think that they might be offered as a collector's item

752
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,450
We're very rare now. I guess right

753
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,530
Common growing up no no they still sell those little plastic

754
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,470
You know just like three four poses toy soldiers in a couple of different colors, so you can have a pose

755
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,630
I mean remember the ones that came in a box like 50 or 100. They're real small

756
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:15,770
Plastic all right well what I'm saying they don't but you the second iteration of human

757
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,610
Made them so they don't mind being played with and I mean like when you get the little toy soldiers and play but some of

758
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:26,570
The children back, then they played real rough when they finished playing with the soldiers

759
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,410
They threw a bunch of turpentine and lit them on fire. Yeah, of course right and

760
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,150
This is what I mean. You know play with people don't mind being treated that way

761
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,110
So this is the iteration that you have right now

762
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,650
Now the question is maybe you're a leftover if you here's the thing for sure

763
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,870
If you're interested in Greek speak you probably got some of the genes of the other ones

764
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:54,610
And that we're not into this kind of stuff. You know they're not just made from the three four poses, and they're just perfect

765
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,930
It's getting pretty

766
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:03,150
Pretty sick here because it's all gonna be wrapped up pretty soon pretty soon within the big scale so

767
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,190
Yeah, anything else. We're gonna make this a short one in

768
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,470
No, I think I think we've covered everything pretty well

769
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,890
You know I actually don't have too many other we covered the alien

770
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,410
Proclamations not too long ago unless you had something you wanted to add to what a joke yeah

771
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:29,790
No, but you did mention the reverse technology thing there a little bit ago in the black area, and I said to myself

772
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,870
Well, you know it's not that hard to make stuff that the these idiots can't figure out when I say idiots meaning

773
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,630
They're best engineers right of course

774
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,990
I mean you know because again

775
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,430
They're just not even including everything in the equation that could possibly be there to begin with so it's a you know

776
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,630
And and it's evident in the computers that they put the stuff into to do the work the short

777
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,730
Yeah, well when I saw what I put together in a computer, and it says basically it's not doing anything

778
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,970
It doesn't show any of the effects. I was both happy and sad

779
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,330
I was happy because all these idiots are never gonna figure it out. Even if they try to copy it

780
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,950
Because they're already

781
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,230
What do you call it when you psych someone out psychologically before?

782
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:12,070
Someone has to perform physically, but they get really bad news before they have to perform. They can't perform now

783
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,430
You know what I mean. No you psych them out exactly

784
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,330
They're so psyched out, and they're never gonna, but the sad part is that they're not gonna figure it out

785
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:25,890
You know in other words, so yeah, it's both the same thing makes it make can make one happy and sad

786
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,530
Well, yeah, because on the one hand look you do have a window into something that is rarefied and is

787
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:39,190
Interesting and is something that can you know actually accomplish something and at the same time you see that

788
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:45,210
It's just even though it's so obvious and should be there within an arm's length grasp to anyone

789
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,870
I mean because let's be honest again even though you're a more intelligent guy than most

790
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:55,430
The fact is that there's a whole lot of things right in front of people's faces that they could just reach out and grasp

791
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,910
if they bothered to open their eyes and

792
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,050
They don't

793
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,130
They just don't that's why I tell her to close her eyes

794
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,030
Anyway, that was a bad lascivious joke

795
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,830
But anyway, okay, so we'll leave it at that and maybe in the near future

796
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,450
I'll play around with the idea and ask you a couple of questions about what it is

797
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:23,610
We might do regarding a t-shirt or something. Oh, yeah, I think that's better visual show me

798
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,210
in the chat

799
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:31,010
By the way, I just there's a everything is going AI right they're gonna replace the search engines with AI

800
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,650
Yeah, so you won't be able to you won't have any choices pretty much

801
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,430
But there's a lot of most of the graphics design

802
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,290
online now is AI and they'll generate memory you went online or got a program like Photoshop to

803
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:50,770
Put a logo together and you you have a sidebar with all your tools and you start fitting and putting well now you just tell

804
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,130
Basic certain parameters type in and it'll give you a hundred different logos to choose from if you don't like them

805
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,530
Sure, we'll change this for you get another 200 logos pop up, right?

806
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,070
Well, that's why I don't want to do it. I don't want to go to the I want to go to

807
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,070
Where you could this is where you should?

808
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:08,890
Okay

809
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,850
No, hey, where did we go there what happened?

810
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,610
It's been a while, it's it's it's all right, by the way sex is if you want to have children

811
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,450
Otherwise you stay away from him. Hey, listen, I got you and look if it's been a while for you

812
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,790
That's fine. That might explain some things. But anyway, it's okay

813
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:41,290
So that explains it anyway 51 I'm done with it I've done that already and yeah, okay, so

814
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,090
We'll just leave it at that

815
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,770
I
