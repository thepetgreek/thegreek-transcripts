1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,680
Actual thunderstorms where I'm sitting here today, what is it, Sonic 43, Greek?

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,760
Is that where we're at now?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,840
I think so, yeah.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,740
We didn't get into the 42, but 42 is a pretty special number.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,820
I think I might have loosely in other times, but yeah, we're on 43, it appears.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,180
Well, I love it when you start to talk about numbers, because it usually brings you into

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,580
different directions, and actually we wind up landing on a lot of other things, and it's

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,560
not a numerology discussion like you get from the woo-woo crowd out there that sit there

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,280
and they get an answer, right?

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,560
I love these people.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
Very, very happy-clappy.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,480
Yeah, those people, it's great, because just bear with me a second.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,700
They go, okay, I want to talk about 1, 2, 3, and then they realize they don't have anything

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,260
to relate to it, so then they go, well, if you add the 1 and the 2, it makes a 3, so

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,120
now you have two 3s.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,080
Well, yeah, on the 42, it's real short.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,400
It's basically scriptural, and it's also where it's in your face, and it's also in your face

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,440
in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is the answer to everything that's 42.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,160
I thought about it really well, right?

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,540
I think Helen Mirren's the voice for that, and 42 would be the number of stations that

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,960
they stopped in the desert in the Book of Numbers, and also it's the generations of

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
the Messiah, right?

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:35,960
And many people think one of them is missing, it's really 41, it's an error, but it's not,

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:51,460
because Joseph is mentioned twice, because of her husband and her gauda, in Aramaic, her

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,680
guardian, she came, yeah, her guardian, it doesn't say her father.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,760
It seems like what happened, perhaps, was a mother was widowed, and the brother came in,

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,060
right?

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,380
It's kind of presumptuous, but when someone is, in Scripture, when the father...

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,580
Well, that was a matter of culture, though, wasn't that more of a cultural thing that

30
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,280
just ends up in the Scripture, or is that a scriptural purpose?

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,300
Which one is it?

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,160
It's both.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,760
It's culture.

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,840
It's all culture, really.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,020
It is all culture, or cult.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
What happens in Scripture, it's suggested that when a woman's husband dies, the brother

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,340
steps in, the brother of the father figure.

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,220
And that kind of survived a long way into a lot of the, let's call them Mediterranean

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,080
peoples, you become responsible for, now, I don't have any brothers, but my understanding

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,180
among other Italians who are very tied to their culture, again, I love that, the culture,

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,020
a lot of the...

42
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,200
They have brothers, they go, well, now, because my brother has passed away, or my brother's

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
in jail, well, they kind of take up the responsibility of, I gotta take care of their wife.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,960
And I always thought of that as just a good, solid, kind of like family value, but...

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,340
It's tribal.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,260
It was tribal.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,720
It's actually tribal.

48
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,080
Yeah.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,620
I would suggest.

50
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,040
Well, I think a lot of, but a lot of family values began as tribal things, because at

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,880
a certain point, we were all parts of tribal people at one time or another, right?

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,040
Still is.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,280
Oh, still is.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,820
Yeah, still is.

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,300
It's just not, you wouldn't lean on that term too much.

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,940
I got you.

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,740
Jackie Robinson's uniform, number two, by the way, was 42, but go ahead, yeah.

58
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,600
Oh, okay, yeah.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,900
You'll find it here and there, the popular ones, yeah.

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,520
But it's six times seven, which seven is overrated.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,860
Seven just means it's from above, sort of, eight is perfection, completion.

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,020
I think I've gone over on the original O and G, Ocelli in the Greek, number four is really

63
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,740
the relative number of a grouping of seven, right?

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,460
Being a center number.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:10,380
And you'll see four being in more divine placements than seven, if you're paying attention.

66
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,959
Well, we talked about this scientifically as well, when we were talking about the balance

67
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,600
of the magnetic, putting the magnets together, right?

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,360
The odd number, that way you have a center, or you don't, depending on what it is you're

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,140
trying to accomplish.

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,980
So there is a matter of energetic force that's attached to the odd or the even number, depending

71
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,500
on what it is you're doing, right?

72
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,180
Okay, so I'm just saying, there's a lot of ways to look at this in a general sense.

73
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,120
Energetic is a big term, believe it or not, because the limited perception we have is

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,700
whatever perceptions we have, it's very subjective, right?

75
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,480
Of course.

76
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,700
Well, what some people call energy is negated by others, and subtle energies don't mean

77
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,400
that they're weak.

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,580
There's a lot going on with that.

79
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,220
Well, as always, many things are subject to interpretation because of people's perspectives,

80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,500
because they only know what they observe, or they only know what they were told, depending

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,860
on the circumstance, right?

82
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,260
Yeah, the medical does not acknowledge energy, right?

83
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,800
It's just physical and chemical.

84
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,440
Right.

85
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,360
They just want to talk about, and we did that before too, is it's not only just about when

86
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,100
we were talking about the plants and how the chemist looks at the plant and says, okay,

87
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,460
what chemical does this?

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,840
But meanwhile, they don't study the actual characters of the plant.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,060
Is it something that grows upward, outward?

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,800
Is it something that stays in the dirt?

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,020
things are relative to the way the thing behaves when interacting with other natural things,

92
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,260
right?

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:38,860
Right.

94
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,920
When it's taken internally or externally.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

96
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,440
And these things are accountable, but you will not find it in the pocket handbook for

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,740
medicine.

98
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,800
It's not going to be there.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
It used to be.

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,380
It used to be, but now, no way, right?

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,900
Yeah.

102
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,880
Last hundred years or so, not at all.

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,740
It shows you.

104
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,180
Well, it goes to show you, as they say, who's in control.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,580
There you have it.

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,180
And of course, it's hidden for a reason because it would actually give you reason to be able

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,500
to navigate things, I think.

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,000
I would say it's hidden as much as not unacknowledged.

109
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,400
You know what?

110
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
That's a better, yeah.

111
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,960
That is a better way to look at it, if it's unacknowledged as opposed to, because it's

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,520
not truly hidden if you can still find it, right?

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah.

114
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,900
I mean, it's not hidden very well anyway, like hide and seek.

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,560
It's mostly accessible.

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,240
Most things are still accessible.

117
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,620
It's just not readily accessible and unacknowledged.

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,900
Most people, you know, what they're taught is this is your authority, right?

119
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,420
And once you get that, and then if it doesn't come from them, it doesn't exist.

120
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,880
Well, and that's the largest problem to me all the time, is that, you know, who is it

121
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,640
that somebody accepts as an authority?

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,060
And then that becomes the relevant place where information comes from, right?

123
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,860
So, you know, any circumstance doesn't matter if it's, you know, the most intricate political

124
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,820
or geocentric discussion about, you know, the movement of people on the planet, or if

125
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,320
it's a simple argument over what just happened, right?

126
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,080
Depending on what somebody acknowledges and depending on somebody else coming along, if

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:23,660
you weren't there to witness it or experience it yourself, and you're there for by, you

128
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,760
What do they say?

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,800
There are some more reliable witnesses than others, sure, on a basic level.

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,120
But then there's also this concept of authority where the reason why this person, no matter

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,040
how crazy that sounds, what just came out of that guy's mouth, he's an authority on

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,500
this because, right?

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,680
He's got these letters after his name because he went through the educational institution.

134
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,040
They're very confident to do this because it's been going on for thousands of years,

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,320
right?

136
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,740
And people are very reliable in that in that sense.

137
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,900
Well, it's a very, very, very consistent formula that works, and it is literally on the base

138
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,880
level a con game.

139
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,780
It is a matter of putting confidence into the individual, right?

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,460
So it doesn't matter that they're there to rob you.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,500
If the guy with confidence presents the three card Monte game like, hey, look, this is a

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,680
game of chance, and we're going to have fun and let's enjoy it.

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,840
And here I'm going to dangle in front of you the possibility that you're going to get something

144
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,340
out of this.

145
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,160
All of that is only relevant because the guy has the confidence that he is getting from

146
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
you because he's now sucked you in.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,280
If it's a three card Monte on the street, he's done it instantaneously.

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,799
If it's some other continuous situation, right?

149
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
All these things.

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,240
Well, they're religious.

151
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,659
Yeah.

152
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,020
Also, well, that's the thing.

153
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,880
Why is it?

154
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,980
Why is it that this guy telling me what's in the Bible or what's in the book is important

155
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,280
because he's a guy who's supposed to have studied it.

156
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,860
He's a guy who's supposed to be an authority on this.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,480
So they rarely, they rarely do tell you anything that they're saying is in the Bible.

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,860
And if they do, it's out of context.

159
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,520
And then they and it's not even that they tell you what's actually in there.

160
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,480
They tell you, look, what they mean is they might reference it real quick.

161
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,280
Oh, you know, according to John, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

162
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,700
And I'm callously not even bothering to give an acknowledgement to the specifics because

163
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,340
it doesn't matter.

164
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
They have a point they're making.

165
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
They make a reference that they say is to that thing.

166
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,700
And you know, maybe it is.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,500
Maybe it isn't.

168
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,580
And maybe it's just an interpretation, which obviously, if they're speaking English to

169
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,320
begin with, it's already an interpretation.

170
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,620
It's a version that they're working with from its roots.

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,140
Yeah.

172
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,300
Interpretation should be as accurate as possible.

173
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,880
And it's an information transfer where version means the definitions are loose.

174
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,640
The information is loosely, you know, how would you say, brought over?

175
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,380
Right.

176
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, you know, the whole the whole idea when you see subjective based on a true story,

177
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,620
you know what I mean?

178
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah.

179
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,920
It's based on a true story.

180
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,400
But that does that has a very wide variety of possibilities in it when you say it's based

181
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,580
on a true story.

182
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,400
So back to this confidence thing, though, and communication and again, the number 42, which

183
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
is where I took you away from.

184
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,740
Your interpretation of numbers is much better and less, you know, OK, I couldn't fit it

185
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,140
that way.

186
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,500
I mean, it's really what they used to call that a cold reading, you know, OK, you throw

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,020
a couple of answers out there and you wait for the reaction and you wait to see if somebody

188
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,300
bites.

189
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,100
Oh, they bid on that.

190
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,300
Great.

191
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,060
I'll go that way.

192
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,980
So instead of adding the numbers, maybe they subtract them and they get the right reaction.

193
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,220
Oh, yes, that's right.

194
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,340
Now it comes to two, which means something to me.

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,860
You know, now it goes.

196
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,060
Yeah.

197
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,620
It goes.

198
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,600
It goes to six.

199
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,660
It goes to six.

200
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,740
We add them together.

201
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,440
It goes to six.

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,960
And you know what happens if we're talking about it three times, that means three sixes

203
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,240
and therefore and so on.

204
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
And they're pulling this.

205
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,040
Well, here's the thing that people have discussed with numbers and it's about we don't live

206
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,540
in a numeric or we could say more arithmetic than numeric world.

207
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,640
It's you also have to bring in geometric forms, the visual.

208
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,060
Right.

209
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:16,320
So to say that someone is strictly a numerology as numbers by themselves is kind of futile

210
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,080
unless you're deriving it from like numeric values of words again, because those that

211
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,260
structured the words also structured it with the background for number significance.

212
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:35,140
But in the world itself, numbers as we use them and arithmetic and mathematics, right,

213
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,740
they're different.

214
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,880
It's just another language.

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,040
And it has to comport to something real and tangible.

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,180
And usually, well, now at the point, you know, they say, well, the math shows that this is

217
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,740
going on.

218
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,940
Right.

219
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,880
And it's fictional.

220
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,420
You know, it's gotten to the point now where all these fictions are coming together to

221
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,960
create reality, which which at some point is actually legitimate.

222
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,500
Right.

223
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,260
If someone's reality is based on fiction, right, and the reality is based on belief,

224
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,860
it's legitimate.

225
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,980
It's it's not true.

226
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,520
Just like very often I bring up when someone gives you a history book and you know everything

227
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,640
in there, pretty much 99 percent is BS.

228
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,460
Why should you get upset?

229
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,540
Because if you look at the title, it doesn't say true history, does it?

230
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,100
No.

231
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,440
Just says history.

232
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:21,780
Right.

233
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,740
So this is how one can take things, you know, the truth is too minimal to bring out to the

234
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,280
public and it's minimal.

235
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,260
And it also requires full comprehension.

236
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,340
Well, there's the difficulty because an uninformed truth, right, is basically useless.

237
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:46,100
I mean, the bottom line is, if you don't understand numbers, let's just say, and I give you the

238
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,480
equations that would, you know, give you a working way to deal with everything in the

239
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,220
world and you don't know the way equations just means that one side balances to the other.

240
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,820
Well, right.

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:57,980
Right.

242
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,160
But if I give you the equations to make balance out of many things that are in imbalance in

243
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,320
your life, which is very important, if I give you those equations and you don't know how

244
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,740
they apply, it's kind of useless.

245
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,440
I mean, what's comprehension?

246
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,380
Right.

247
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,220
Because, you know, look, if I if I gave you, you know, perfect knowledge, if I gave you

248
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,820
a perfect medical book, I mean, one that you'd read and go, you know what?

249
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,760
This is somebody who's actually explaining everything top to bottom about the human body.

250
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,020
If it's in a language that you know, it's in it's in Russian and you can't read that

251
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,580
because it's a wholly different language.

252
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,940
It's not even recognizable to to the English language.

253
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,320
We don't even use the same alphabet.

254
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
It's kind of useless to you.

255
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,460
I mean, I could give you the whole thing on neurology, the brain, the science of the brain

256
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,240
and tell you how every single thing works in the brain.

257
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,340
But if you don't know how to read Russian, kind of useless to you.

258
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,640
Right.

259
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,860
Well, in most people, nothing in the brain is working.

260
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Well, there's that, too.

261
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,460
Well, this is well, this is where it comes down to, you know, most people think they

262
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,940
are making choices.

263
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,900
No, the choices were already made for you.

264
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,300
You have to make decisions, right?

265
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,660
It's not.

266
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,040
This is not a play on words.

267
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,340
Right.

268
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:06,980
Oh, yeah.

269
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,800
So you're talking about choices, but they don't they don't take hold of what decisions

270
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,460
they've made.

271
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:11,880
Right.

272
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,580
So, you know, the choices would be the menu board and the decision is what you actually

273
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,980
order.

274
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,340
Right.

275
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,720
Let's say, you know, in a luncheonette context.

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, luncheonette.

277
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,100
There's a word that nobody uses anymore.

278
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,620
Luncheonette.

279
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,000
You know what?

280
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,600
In the luncheonette, though, really, the choices that you order are not really choices anyway.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,920
There's selections from a prescribed menu.

282
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,240
Right.

283
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:30,600
Yeah.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,640
If you were deciding what it is, those people were going to go and pick up and bring back

285
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,240
to the place and cook and you made that decision all by yourself, then you'd actually be making

286
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,700
a choice.

287
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,780
But you're just making a selection, isn't that right?

288
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,180
Yeah.

289
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,940
But I'm trying to bring out the point that what people view as their subjective preferences

290
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,520
are not what they end up with.

291
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,700
No.

292
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:51,880
Right.

293
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Think of voting.

294
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,220
Right.

295
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,780
Or whatever.

296
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,960
Well, if they were never offered like that.

297
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,360
Well, but they were never offered the ability to make a subjective selection.

298
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,640
Right.

299
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,840
Again, it's it's not a choice because it's still off of the menu.

300
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,620
They didn't put the menu together.

301
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,600
It's the same if all the choices are coming from one place where, you know, where's the

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,200
right.

303
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,620
No.

304
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,820
Well, then ultimately it's a narrowed down set of choices.

305
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
You know, what was it?

306
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,900
Some dictatorships or communists, they had voting polls, but there was only one person

307
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,440
on the ballot.

308
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:22,760
Right.

309
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,480
Right.

310
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,060
Exactly.

311
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,660
You know, and you can have a a show trial.

312
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,160
It doesn't mean you ever got a fair trial.

313
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,640
Right.

314
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,160
You know, they already know the outcome is going to be, you know, it's either way, either

315
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,400
way.

316
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,020
It's lawful or unlawful.

317
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,160
I would dispute it.

318
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,600
That's one thing that's out of out of the what's used against people will say, oh, this is

319
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
an unlawful gathering or this is unlawful.

320
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,940
They really don't have any rights to that because they're not lawful.

321
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,540
They just use that term.

322
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:50,860
Right.

323
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,080
Like 9-11 is I always use that as a reference.

324
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,420
They call it a terrorist attack.

325
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,820
It really wasn't no terrorism.

326
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,420
It was sabotage because everything that happened was already in place.

327
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,280
All they had to do was misuse what was in place.

328
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,560
Right.

329
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Well, every day is whoever you want to.

330
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,020
Yeah.

331
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,660
And every day.

332
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:07,920
Sure.

333
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,920
It's L.A. 9-11.

334
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,780
Here's the thing.

335
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,900
You know, a lot of the police out there, you know, the five.

336
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Oh, when they show up, I hear this argument all the time on a lot of videos out there

337
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,260
where people are trying to demonstrate something.

338
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,700
You know, I'm giving you a lawful order.

339
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,840
And I just cringe every time I hear that.

340
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,080
And it's usually, you know, the guy in the blue uniform.

341
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,900
Well, they're law enforcement.

342
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,900
They don't know any law at all.

343
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,720
But, you know, maybe they might go back to something.

344
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,580
Let's say, well, law and 10 Commandments, right.

345
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,540
Or something like that.

346
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:40,900
OK.

347
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,880
Out of context.

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,160
Yeah.

349
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,980
But that's not.

350
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,340
Yeah.

351
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,020
It's it's.

352
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,120
Look, it's a matter of belief.

353
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,500
Someone who believes something, even if it's fictional, it is true to them.

354
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,100
Right.

355
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:01,940
So, again, if you go back to the way numbers structure, they're basically little bits of

356
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,420
pressure that push the mind to certain directions, you know, like the better numbers like number

357
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,819
seven.

358
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,319
Right.

359
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,220
Or number 21.

360
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,099
And then you've got the worst off numbers, like the most worst off number would be 13.

361
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,359
That puts a different pressure on the mind.

362
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:16,819
Right.

363
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,720
So there's a sense, again, it's all subjective.

364
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,099
So it's really difficult to get into the, quote unquote, the numbers because they just

365
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,540
don't exist on their own anyway.

366
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,620
And it's based on and it's based on a whole lot of crap that has nothing to do with numbers

367
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,200
which are objective.

368
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Numbers themselves are.

369
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,740
Well, like horoscopes.

370
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, yeah.

371
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,280
OK.

372
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,160
But numbers themselves are objective.

373
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
And what do I mean by that?

374
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,940
Here's the thing.

375
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,300
Like I like to play.

376
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,820
You've played cards.

377
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,720
I know you have.

378
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,760
And I like to play cards.

379
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,640
I actually enjoy cards a lot.

380
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,500
And I love the fact that they make them in many different forms, a lot of different artwork.

381
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,920
I collect aces of spades.

382
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,560
OK.

383
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
Anyways, forget my personal quirk aside.

384
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,120
Here's the thing about it, though.

385
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,460
Some people are intimidated by that card alone.

386
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,340
Now, I've always found it to be as as kooky as this is going to sound to be a lucky card

387
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,620
for me.

388
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,260
Whenever I draw it, I seem to win.

389
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,580
That's according to my memory.

390
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,800
And this is my prejudice.

391
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,840
Now, a lot of other people see it as the unlucky card because they were told at some point it

392
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,960
is a death card.

393
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,220
Well, again, it's a pressure.

394
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
In other words, what direction does it send them?

395
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
And does it send them left, right, forward, backward?

396
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,660
Right.

397
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, yeah.

398
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,840
But the fact that it's a driving mechanism.

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,100
Yeah.

400
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,680
But the fact that it's nothing more than, you know, a plastic coated piece of paper

401
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,340
or a linen coated piece of paper.

402
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,320
We mentioned Confucius, you know, symbols that matter, that direct people's minds, not

403
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,720
words.

404
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,160
Right.

405
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,020
And the fact is that it's just a small piece of, again, paper that's coated or maybe not

406
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,620
coated depending.

407
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,080
You've got a cheap deck, what have you.

408
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,900
And they make them in all sorts of grades, just like anything else.

409
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,180
And you can get high quality cards that are like almost light as air, slide perfectly

410
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,620
and have nice, smooth, durable edges.

411
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,220
They make them out of plastic as well.

412
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,940
And so on and so forth.

413
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,200
Right.

414
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,260
But here's the thing.

415
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,360
All of the things that come into play in somebody's mind can influence them during a friendly game

416
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,840
of anything.

417
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,820
The second that that ace of spades drops out there.

418
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,340
That's not why it's my favorite.

419
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,640
But the thing is, it's just interesting to me how somebody can be pushed by a piece of

420
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,340
paper that really has no relevance to their life or anything else and half the time doesn't

421
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,580
even have relevance to the game.

422
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,740
It's just because it has that symbology.

423
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,400
It has all of those things that are built into it in their minds alone.

424
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,140
It's an image training.

425
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,360
Image training.

426
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay.

427
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,020
There's an interesting term.

428
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,380
Image training.

429
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Stop the red octagon.

430
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,760
Any intersection in the world?

431
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,420
Yeah.

432
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,820
Absolutely.

433
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,560
Is there a red octagon?

434
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,640
No matter what's written in there, you're going to stop.

435
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:51,980
Right.

436
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,980
Universally.

437
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,100
Badge.

438
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes.

439
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,980
Universally, people know that that red octagon is a stop sign.

440
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,160
And the color red is an indication.

441
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,580
Someone flashes a badge.

442
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,820
A badge, too.

443
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,420
And because it's a star, you know, and they have eight pointed stars in some places, six

444
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,200
pointed in others.

445
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,260
But either way, it's a shiny.

446
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,760
It's also don't forget, they're always supposed to be shiny.

447
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,420
I like the.

448
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,620
Are you familiar with the doctor who the psychological papers?

449
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,460
It's just a blank piece of paper where whoever you show it to, it ends up representing the

450
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,300
highest authority in their world.

451
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,360
I remember that.

452
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,320
I remember that.

453
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,800
I always I find that interesting.

454
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,980
There's a couple of sci fi tropes like that that are interesting.

455
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm actually.

456
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,900
That's commentary.

457
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:31,480
Yeah.

458
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,340
It's disappointing.

459
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,460
They don't use it more often because that's commentary on top of commentary.

460
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,080
Anyway, speaking of commentary, by the way, Bansky, are you familiar with Banks Banksy

461
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,560
Banks?

462
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,520
The artist.

463
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,060
Yeah.

464
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,100
Yeah.

465
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,920
I like his stuff.

466
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,320
It's just been coming up lately.

467
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,740
And I took some time to look at most of his, you know, let's say pieces.

468
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,800
I'm actually surprised you like Banksy.

469
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,300
OK.

470
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:55,900
Well, why?

471
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,980
What do you appreciate about everything?

472
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,120
I like everything he does.

473
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,820
OK.

474
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,800
He's he's actually he's sort of going along the lines of Marcel Duchamp, who was part

475
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:15,760
of the Dada movement in the 1920s and on, actually knew his nephew and cleaned out one

476
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,320
of his studios once on Green Street in Soho back in the early 80s.

477
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,840
But Dumont, you say?

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,140
Duchamp.

479
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,840
Oh, Duchamp.

480
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,700
Marcel, M-A-R-C-E-L and Duchamp.

481
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,540
Don't ask me his spell.

482
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,700
So I think it's D-U-C-D-U and then Champ Duchamp.

483
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,220
And he was a chess master.

484
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,640
So the chess community knew him as a chess master that might have painted.

485
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,220
But in the artist community knew him as an artist that played chess.

486
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,200
He disagreed with the way art was.

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,740
He says the artists go to school.

488
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,300
It's like a trade, like becoming a plumber or a carpenter.

489
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,060
It's too restricted.

490
00:21:51,780 --> 00:22:01,140
He was when he was invited to a gallery to do bring in something to represent his work.

491
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,080
He completely forgot and didn't care.

492
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,860
And just one hour before the show was open, he went down to the hardware store on Houston

493
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,620
and West Broadway and bought a urinal nailed it to a piece of plywood.

494
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,200
They brought it to the gallery as his exhibit with his name on it.

495
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,140
And it was rave reviews.

496
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,360
This is like back in the 1950s.

497
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,280
And it made him famous.

498
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,560
Basically gave him a piss pot.

499
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,740
They told him it was beautiful.

500
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,140
They told me it was beautiful.

501
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
He was really making fun of the artist community.

502
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,580
Banksy does the same, right?

503
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,700
Yeah, I always find it funny when these guys, they start netting a lot of money for stuff

504
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,720
and then they just turn around and really present something as a joke almost.

505
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,920
He was throwing knitting needles in the eyes of the artist community.

506
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,360
Again, this is one of the benefits of being old school.

507
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,540
Yeah, the Greek is old school.

508
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,520
How many young people know about Banksy?

509
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,900
How many people know that he's just like Marcel Duchamp?

510
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,260
They're not old enough.

511
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,060
So there you go.

512
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,660
Old school.

513
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,540
Right, right.

514
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,120
OK.

515
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,200
Fair enough.

516
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,880
I was not familiar with Duchamp.

517
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,100
Yeah, young whippersnapper.

518
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,180
That's why.

519
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,060
Not really.

520
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,920
But anyway, he's one of those guys.

521
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,160
Look, maybe I'm a little more cultured.

522
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,380
Maybe you got a little more cultured than me.

523
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,720
That could be a possibility.

524
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No, it's just I was around these...

525
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,020
Yeah, but more mature palate, not just for food, right?

526
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,440
OK.

527
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,980
Yeah, right.

528
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,780
But maybe I'm more cultured in other ways and it's not just about what they can grow

529
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,520
in a Petri dish.

530
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,480
Look, I got drawn into the community.

531
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
It was quite interesting.

532
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,720
No, I got you.

533
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,780
Look, same time that you might have gotten drawn into the artist community.

534
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,980
Look, I spent a little time in the musician, you know.

535
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,040
At one point, the landlady, I'll mention her name, Dori Ashton, she was the most famous

536
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,840
art critic in the world for a long time.

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,220
So in her living room, she'd show me like all the...

538
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,180
In other words, if you wanted to be a famous artist in New York between the 50s and the

539
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,920
80s, she had to pretty much whatever, recommend you.

540
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,660
And she had all these Matisse's and you could go on and on and on in her house and all that.

541
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,820
I got you.

542
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,640
Basically, upstairs from where I lived.

543
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,620
No, I mean, culturally, I was immersed in the musician community where, you know, I

544
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,540
met people that, you know, composed ballets and things like that.

545
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,860
I mean, I was a heavy metal musician, but I had a much more diverse cultural experience

546
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,580
than that.

547
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,160
And quite honestly...

548
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,500
Well, you had opera.

549
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
I didn't get into...

550
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,060
One of my landlords was Don Yule, D-O-N Yule.

551
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,960
You like Yule Log?

552
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

553
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,580
He was part of the Lincoln Center.

554
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,340
He was a pretty...

555
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,160
He was a baritone.

556
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,470
And he was...

557
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,500
I rented a warehouse space that he had in Brooklyn for doing restoration cast works.

558
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,260
Wasn't he instrumental in some of the restoration stuff also?

559
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,420
No, he was just a pretty...

560
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,560
He was just a singer and performer and administrator also at Lincoln Center.

561
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,240
Yeah, no, I thought that he might have been...

562
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,180
Remember when they did the kind of renovations and restoration and they did like some...

563
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,160
Oh, no, he was just a landlord.

564
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,480
He invested in real estate property and I needed a space to do what I was doing.

565
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,300
He was a singer.

566
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,280
He was a baritone.

567
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,820
Fair enough.

568
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,400
He passed away in 2015.

569
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,600
You ever walk in a room, someone's got such a heavy voice that when they speak,

570
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,780
everything in the room vibrates.

571
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,020
Just normal speech, right?

572
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,700
Very few, but yeah.

573
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,600
Yeah, I've been...

574
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,760
Yeah, yeah, he had that type of voice.

575
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,460
Tall, tall guy from Oklahoma.

576
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,700
And Mickey Rooney was his cousin, so he comes from the Rooney family,

577
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,940
on the mother's side.

578
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,960
Some guys that I met in radio over the years are like that.

579
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,840
They have these incredibly just booming voices that just in their regular speech,

580
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,120
it's just so...

581
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,300
Yeah, it's a given trait.

582
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,160
There's a John B. Wells guy that does that.

583
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,940
He used to do the...

584
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,760
Oh, that guy.

585
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,340
Remember the movie trailers?

586
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
They used to have a voiceover?

587
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

588
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,820
Back in the day?

589
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,400
Not anymore.

590
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:57,920
Yeah.

591
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,740
He used to do those movie voiceovers.

592
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,940
Well, there was one guy.

593
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,240
That wasn't him, but there was one guy who pretty much did them all for five, six years.

594
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,480
Remember?

595
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah.

596
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,820
That guy, right?

597
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,720
Yeah, right, yeah.

598
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,320
When did they stop?

599
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
Probably early 2000s, right?

600
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,680
Something like that.

601
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,040
They stopped all that.

602
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,560
The Wells voice is funny, though, because I joked about it.

603
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,760
I was supposed to be a guest on his show at one point, and then I wasn't,

604
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,460
and I don't know why.

605
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,040
But there was a weird thing that happened there where I was talking to people about,

606
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,940
yeah, wait until you talk to him off air.

607
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,580
I'm like, why?

608
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,940
And they said, because you know how he sounds on air, that really intense,

609
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,720
just drenched in bass voice he's got?

610
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,260
And I'm like, yeah.

611
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,420
It's performance, you know?

612
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,860
And they're like, no, no.

613
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,460
That's exactly the opposite.

614
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,300
It's a rare thing.

615
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,700
They said, no, that's just the way he talks.

616
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,140
Like, that's just him naturally.

617
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,000
You talk to him off air.

618
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
So, how are you doing?

619
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,100
You know, I'm like, he's really like that all the time?

620
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,640
Yeah, it's a natural attribute.

621
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,380
Don, you'll like that as well, yeah.

622
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,800
So, I mean, like, I got involved with a guy named David Peele in New York.

623
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,680
Now, that name might ring a bell for somebody if they were deep in the musician

624
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
culture stuff, and everybody knows he had a tremendous archive.

625
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,040
But I was in his living room, which was like wall-to-wall tapes of every kind

626
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,720
you could imagine.

627
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,240
He had tape of everybody.

628
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,320
He had stuff from, you know, Jimi Hendrix performing in people's apartments,

629
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,660
in people's lofts in the late 60s, just hanging out in the air.

630
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,800
Jimi Hendrix's studio was right there, Electric Ladyland on 8th Street, right?

631
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,260
Oh, yeah.

632
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
Between 5th and 6th.

633
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,640
But famously, he would walk into people's places where, you know,

634
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,280
they would just have these little jam sessions and lofts and stuff.

635
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,680
He would sit down with his own tape recorder and just jam with people sometimes,

636
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,160
if he knew them, in New York.

637
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,420
And this guy had some of those tapes of, like, you know,

638
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,960
the stuff straight from Hendrix and things like that.

639
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,520
And he famously, a lot of people ended up with bootlegs of his, you know,

640
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,040
like in the 90s and the 80s, I think.

641
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,640
But I actually just was in the same neighborhood as that guy.

642
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,420
That was the East Village.

643
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,620
You know, the East Village was a pretty interesting place culturally,

644
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,980
musician-wise.

645
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:04,980
I lived there, like, from 86 to 89 on 11th Street between 2nd and 3rd.

646
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,300
Yeah, see, now, around the time that you were leaving is when I went in there,

647
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,780
and I went in, it was East 9th Street between 1st and 8th, right?

648
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,140
Yeah, so Venero's Italian pastry shop, I think, is on 9th Street, right?

649
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
Between 1st and 2nd.

650
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,380
I don't remember that one because the Chinese place was on the corner,

651
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,740
and then I don't remember any other food going in that direction

652
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,760
because the pizza place I went to would be the one on the corner of 8th and A,

653
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
right, which was open 24 hours.

654
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,200
Yeah, I like Stromboli's better on 2nd Avenue.

655
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,080
Really?

656
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,960
Because they put a little sugar in the sauce.

657
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,800
I like when the pizza has that sweet sauce.

658
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,100
You know, Stromboli, I think it was on 7th Street and 2nd Avenue, I think.

659
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,180
No, 1st Avenue.

660
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,320
I don't remember that one.

661
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,160
I don't remember that one.

662
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,340
Yeah, well, it was a pizza joint every two blocks.

663
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,420
Yeah, that was the other thing.

664
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,040
And I would go to Kiev on 7th and 2nd for the Russian food, you know,

665
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,520
the Ukrainian food, let's say.

666
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,480
Yeah, I never got into that too much.

667
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,780
When I wanted Japanese, I went to that place, Dojo's.

668
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,700
That was nice.

669
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,340
Oh, that's where I always used to eat.

670
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,840
I used to get the soy burger dinner for $3.

671
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,300
Oh, well, the vegetable, just the tempura.

672
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,360
I would just sit there and eat the tempura because, you know,

673
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,780
it was the greatest snack, and I don't know,

674
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,800
it was one of the healthiest things I could get to eat in New York.

675
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,120
I loved that place.

676
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,260
It was great.

677
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,280
Most of the seats were outdoors, you know, on the terrace there.

678
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,500
Yeah, I would eat there often, the Dojo.

679
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,720
I still talk about it.

680
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,980
And I did finally imitate their sauce.

681
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,800
It was a great place.

682
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,740
Oh, wait a minute.

683
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,960
You're talking about the dipping sauce?

684
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,540
Yeah, both the dipping sauce and the carrot ginger sauce.

685
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,020
Oh, man.

686
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,260
I can copy that.

687
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah, I make that perfectly.

688
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,940
That dipping sauce, if you can copy that, that's wonderful.

689
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,280
Oh, I can.

690
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
I can give you the recipe.

691
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,240
I will gladly take it because I would love to be able to dip just about anything.

692
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,260
Grated ginger, chopped green onion.

693
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,480
You got to get – you could add sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, white pepper.

694
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
That's pretty much it.

695
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,460
That's it.

696
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,060
You're better off getting and putting – you're going to need mirin,

697
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,980
M-I-R-I-N, which is sweet wine, Japanese sweet wine.

698
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,020
It's basically a sweetener.

699
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,320
Mirin.

700
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,820
Mirin.

701
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,520
It's a seasoning.

702
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,520
They use it for rice.

703
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,200
Okay.

704
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,480
Yeah, mirin, M-I-R-I-N.

705
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,340
It's a sweet Japanese cooking wine.

706
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,560
And that's basically the recipe for the dipping sauce.

707
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,040
And for the carrot ginger, it's carrot, ginger, tahini, a little sugar,

708
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,240
a little tiny bit of tomato paste, sesame oil, salad oil, and rice wine vinegar.

709
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,500
Well, I'll have to get some – see now, here's where I'm going to need a little math

710
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,020
because just because you gave me that doesn't mean I know how much of each thing to put in.

711
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,820
It's a taste.

712
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,740
You'll figure it out.

713
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,420
Really?

714
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,120
What you do is what I do – well, what I tell people is before you start mixing stuff,

715
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,120
regardless of the proportions of the recipe, start tasting everything.

716
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,860
But if something is extremely harsh, don't taste it because it could corrupt your –

717
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,120
it could corrupt your taste buds for the rest of the night.

718
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,060
All right.

719
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,800
So like the last thing you want to do is when you start cooking is start tasting just plain salt first

720
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,740
because anything you taste after that is going to taste like it doesn't have enough salt, right?

721
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,320
Right.

722
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,780
So you have to be careful what you taste first.

723
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,740
But basically the main – when you do the dipping sauce,

724
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,740
the main amount of liquid is going to be probably 50-50 mirin and then soy sauce, right?

725
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,280
Okay.

726
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,580
And then a third – then the rule is you're not going to add oil to it

727
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
because it's a dipping sauce for fried food.

728
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,640
Then a third of that would be your vinegar.

729
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,280
You could do a little bit of orange rind.

730
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,400
I would heat up the orange rind a little bit with the liquid and let it cool down.

731
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,680
Those really good dipping sauces, by the way, those ingredients that I gave,

732
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,180
if you mix them warm in a double boiler pot – don't boil.

733
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,180
Don't even simmer.

734
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,300
Don't even think about simmering.

735
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,580
Just warm or hot.

736
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,160
Okay.

737
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,680
And then let it cool down overnight and you get more of the flavor out of it.

738
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,320
So those are the fine points of it.

739
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,860
Okay.

740
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,880
But, I mean, it's primarily a lot of soy sauce though and then everything else is –

741
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,080
Yeah, a third.

742
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,540
Well, if it's a light soy sauce, if you're getting a heavy soy sauce or tamari,

743
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,200
one is made with soy, tamari is made with wheat.

744
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,120
I would use tamari.

745
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,300
I would water it down a little bit.

746
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,180
Again, taste it.

747
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,900
Get familiar with the flavors, right?

748
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,740
And anything that's – like a really good quality salt should always have a sweet finish.

749
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,020
After you taste it and your palate relaxes, it should have a slightly sweet finish,

750
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,040
not a strong metallic like iodized salt does, right?

751
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,900
Get that good popcorn kind of effect where you have a little bit of sweetness

752
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,780
and the salt together so it's not overdone.

753
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,980
In England they do that.

754
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,260
In England they always add sugar to their popcorn.

755
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,180
That's a thing.

756
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,480
Yeah, a little bit is always good.

757
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,680
Anyway, okay, so I didn't mean to get a recipe from you, but that's great.

758
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,640
That's fine.

759
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,680
We're just kind of free-floating on this one tonight.

760
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,300
Absolutely.

761
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,920
Well, before we get done, though, I do want to get back to not just the numerology

762
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,420
but the communication because numerology, again, I think it's so – everything is subject –

763
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,920
We haven't communicated at all tonight.

764
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,040
Okay.

765
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,900
No, I'm just joking.

766
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,240
I was waiting for something good to come out of there like, well, what do you mean?

767
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,200
You've actually been dealing with the virtual Greek.

768
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,580
Imagine that for a minute.

769
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,260
How about the AI version of you?

770
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,760
I don't think that's ever going to happen.

771
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
You never can tell.

772
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,820
Somebody might try it.

773
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,280
Anyway.

774
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,800
Think about the logic there.

775
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,400
It won't work.

776
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,420
No, I know.

777
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,880
They can't pull it off.

778
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,560
Again, this is an attempt at jokes.

779
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,440
So anyway, like I was saying about communication, though, and about what is communicated,

780
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,700
one of the more curious things that we have covered before,

781
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,420
and I kind of want to like leave it off at this one if we can,

782
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:08,300
is this idea about, you know, okay, a while back somebody said,

783
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,260
well, what is the purpose of prayer?

784
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,760
All right.

785
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,739
I don't want to go into the purpose necessarily.

786
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,199
I want to ask you something else, though,

787
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,960
and this is about how things can get misdirected, redirected, et cetera.

788
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,440
You know, when you're putting that energy into this communication that's supposed to be prayer, right,

789
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,940
and there's a lot of weird things built into that, a lot of cultural things built into that,

790
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,120
but let's get to the bottom line.

791
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,500
Let's get to the basics of it.

792
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,820
Let's get to not the why of it right away.

793
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,500
Maybe we'll get there eventually, but what about that?

794
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:47,620
What about who you're more likely or what you're more likely communicating with when you do that?

795
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,400
I mean, that's a huge thing.

796
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,239
You're spectators.

797
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:59,720
You're basically indulging in an activity that has spectators watching you, right?

798
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,400
Okay, let's think of it this way.

799
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:11,360
Even loosely in these quote-unquote spiritual talks, isn't it said very loosely that you're always being watched anyway,

800
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,480
however you want to take that?

801
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,020
Well, you're always being watched, and I've always appreciated, believe it or not,

802
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,560
the idea of the giant amphitheater effect like you saw in, say, the Clash of the Titans movie

803
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,780
or you saw often referenced in the Greek slash Roman what they call mythology about the gods, right?

804
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,100
This idea.

805
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
Yeah, they're in a council watching.

806
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,600
Yeah, that we're all on a stage, right?

807
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,720
Oh, I see.

808
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,240
And it's basically just a big play, and they're watching, and sometimes they're influencing,

809
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,580
and every now and then somebody does turn to the audience, say, and says something, right?

810
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,960
The fourth wall break, the directly addressing the audience.

811
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,120
This is something that is done in a lot of plays, and plays were very different in ancient times for sure.

812
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,240
So as an amalgamation of all of it, I kind of think of it in this way when we talk about prayer,

813
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,280
is that we're on a stage, and this is your opportunity to now turn to members of the audience.

814
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,460
But do you know which members of the audience you turn to?

815
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,300
Can you actually see the audience?

816
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,860
There's a lot of large questions there.

817
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,500
Who are you actually communicating with when you do that?

818
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,980
Well, posing the question in regard to prayer is just a matter of, it depends on where it's coming from.

819
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,360
I always give the, in Scripture it's different.

820
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,120
There's preparation.

821
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,140
There's a self-awareness, self-consciousness about your state, right, clean, unclean, all these other things, right?

822
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:46,120
I would suggest that there's also prayers of desperation if you fall off a ship and you're drowning, right, for immediate help.

823
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:52,340
All those are taken in consideration, and it is a spectator kind of event.

824
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,800
In other words, you're always being watched.

825
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,480
The thing is when you're praying, who are you praying to?

826
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,360
Well, that's again, how would you say that?

827
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,300
If we're in a reality that's pre-programmed, which all the evidence seems to show that,

828
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,440
and all the evidence is, I'm becoming more Philip K. Dickish as time goes on.

829
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,360
One of Philip K. Dick's things is that time ended about 50 A.D. and all this.

830
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,220
We're not in the year, let's say 2023.

831
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,900
It's still around 50 A.D.

832
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,360
Everything stopped and we're running simulations, right?

833
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm a big proponent of that.

834
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,620
Yeah, and a lot of people I've recently encountered on the Internet are saying that actually time ended in 2019 completely,

835
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,660
and that we're now just in this.

836
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,960
We like to always make it more contemporary, always, but I'm suggesting it's way, way back, further.

837
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,400
That's why I brought the Philip K. Dick analogy there, or analogy, I should say, again.

838
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,320
I would say that the amount of simulation and the amount of pre-programming that is in place

839
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,320
makes it nearly impossible to state the validity of prayer directly, directly.

840
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:14,560
So you don't see any validity to the argument that if you're praying, maybe that was already preordained as well?

841
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,200
Right, so does it work? Of course it works because it's part of the program.

842
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,340
Because it was already going to happen.

843
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,660
This was going to happen anyway.

844
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,100
Right, exactly.

845
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,540
It's sort of a paradox, but it's not a paradox if you understand the outside influence is predetermined to a degree.

846
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,060
Okay.

847
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,180
But you do have a lot of manipulation.

848
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:39,500
Again, one of the Greek-speak memes and analogies I always give is the cruise ship analogy, right?

849
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,760
Everybody on the cruise ship is going to the same destination,

850
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,640
but you have a lot of freedom and liberties on a cruise ship as a passenger.

851
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,160
So I would take it in that respect as well.

852
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,320
And then the rest of it is personal development in that topic, in that field of spirituality,

853
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,860
and who the gods are and all that.

854
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,960
And what I've always said indirectly, and I've been saying more directly lately, the gods are people, right?

855
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,500
In many respects, they're just like us, except they're gods.

856
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:18,100
So once you start to harmonize that idea, you'll find more power in many more things that you already have.

857
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,700
See, that's always been the confusing aspect of it for me, though,

858
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:31,760
because when people are praying quite often, they're reaching out to some entity that they believe is insert, right?

859
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,440
And that entity, they've handed over things to them.

860
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,460
This is always part of it as well, right?

861
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,740
Yeah, but hold on a second.

862
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,360
This information is very rarefied.

863
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:50,040
What the public, 99.999%, believes they're praying to just simply doesn't exist.

864
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,480
Well, that's the thing.

865
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,780
Since it doesn't.

866
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,300
In the way that they believe it, yeah.

867
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,280
Where is it going?

868
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,020
That's where the program comes in.

869
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah, so.

870
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,220
And the spectators.

871
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:09,100
This is like going to the chat bot, you know, and they have prescribed answers already for if you hit the right keywords.

872
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:18,780
Yeah, and also the people will think about an average human, whatever they could be thinking of, not much, right?

873
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,960
So it's very predictable and pretty easy to accommodate them.

874
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,960
For the most part.

875
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,060
For the most part.

876
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:25,940
Okay.

877
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,880
Well, fair enough.

878
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,000
I mean, what else should people know about this, though?

879
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:37,320
Because I think sometimes, and people have a lot of discussions about this, that, you know, they've addressed the wrong entity, right?

880
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,260
I mean, what do we know about, you want to go back to the horror movies real quick.

881
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:47,240
The trope of, right, you play with the Ouija board, you reach out to the wrong people, you know, you think you're playing a game.

882
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,360
That's also very specific.

883
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,940
The Ouija board in general is going to bring.

884
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,360
Well, you know, that has an entity, a specific entity.

885
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:54,700
Right.

886
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,480
So everything does.

887
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:56,980
Yeah.

888
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,660
No, that one.

889
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,280
And they do give one of the names for it.

890
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,840
But most people don't evoke it and they don't deal with it.

891
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:12,380
And I wouldn't because that's part of the that's part of what shows random chaos in the world, even though it's not really random chaos.

892
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:12,680
Right.

893
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,180
If you invite someone like that.

894
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,960
All right.

895
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,660
So, I mean, in a way, is it prescribed or can you choose to invite for good, for better or worse?

896
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,760
Well, on that level, let's say something like a Ouija board, that would be you're on the cruise ship and you have liberty to do so.

897
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,480
Again, it's many, many levels.

898
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,160
You're not going up to the bridge and telling the captain to steer somewhere else.

899
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:42,720
Or in the meanwhile, while he's steering the ship, can he take a moment from his busy schedule and accommodate you?

900
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,140
That would be a much different level of prayer.

901
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I say.

902
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,160
Right.

903
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,720
Right.

904
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,000
No, it definitely would be.

905
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:55,240
I mean, obviously, things can be done to accommodate you or to cause you problems.

906
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,960
Let's just say you're one of these people that's causing problems.

907
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,080
You might be dealt with by the captain on the ship.

908
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,640
You might be dealing with real gods.

909
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,440
You're going to have problems in your life anyway.

910
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,480
And if you don't think so, then you're not up.

911
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,500
You haven't done your homework.

912
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,580
Right.

913
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,060
So, you know about that, though.

914
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,760
I mean, could you mistakenly reach out to the wrong entity?

915
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,280
No.

916
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,120
I'll tell you why.

917
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,160
Yes and no.

918
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,340
Lower entities.

919
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,740
Yes.

920
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,380
Higher entities.

921
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:22,700
No.

922
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,040
Because they have layers and layers.

923
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,160
In other words, the higher the entity, the more protective and surrounding layers it has.

924
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:39,240
Whatever communication it would get from you or he or she would get from you, really, mostly he, would go through layers.

925
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,500
Right.

926
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,920
And then other layers and other layers, and it gets filtered.

927
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,680
And if it is appropriate, then it's deliberate.

928
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Well, there's a hierarchy.

929
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,680
I mean, look, the CEO of Microsoft is not answering your phone calls when you call customer service.

930
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,620
In very much the same way.

931
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:52,960
Yeah.

932
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,100
What you see modeled here in terms of authority is exactly the same.

933
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,040
Same kind of structure.

934
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,480
Presumably.

935
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:58,940
Kind of structure.

936
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,260
Presumably the same structure.

937
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,800
Presumably.

938
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,280
Okay.

939
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,780
No, fair enough.

940
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,780
I always think that that's a fair question because it's always on people's minds because

941
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:15,540
one of the things that they always seem to seek to do one way or another is interact with the gods because they ask for things.

942
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,100
They ask for, you know, I'm going to pray for someone.

943
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,480
Right.

944
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
I'm going to pray for their this and that.

945
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,600
We've talked about that and where emo work comes in and you can do things.

946
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,580
But sometimes people just, you know, no, I'm just going to pray.

947
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,620
The emo work is very important.

948
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,860
And a lot of people misinterpret that as being self-centered and self-righteous in a way.

949
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:45,680
But what the gods are looking for are for people to discover what attributes they already inherently possess.

950
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,360
And if you don't start searching those attributes and using them, you're considered lazy.

951
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,620
By the way, and this is, you know, subjective comment from the Greek, but I would take it seriously.

952
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,180
Right.

953
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,580
So you're not appreciated if you're squandering your talents that you have.

954
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,840
Yeah. Or, you know, not spending time to discover them, let's say, once once they've been exposed.

955
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,160
But like we talked about the natural talent of somebody's voice or whatever.

956
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,640
I mean, the idea is this is actually the way you commandeer and change your life.

957
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,360
Your law form is how you live, essentially.

958
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,140
And of course, there's exceptions where people are picked out of, you know, other societies, other crowds,

959
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,240
other demeanors to do to serve them.

960
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:41,660
But I would suggest that the evil work is basically acknowledging that you're given a certain amount of tangible power in that world.

961
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,760
You know, the spiritual world by setting yourself up a certain way.

962
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,000
And of course, it's your law form and your law form comes from your God.

963
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,660
Very simple.

964
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,400
Well, there you have it.

965
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,860
So was there anything else that we needed to get to as far as the chat questions and all that?

966
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,340
I think we covered everybody.

967
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,420
Yeah, I just I threw in a comment regarding thoughts without words.

968
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,100
Oh, you just put one in or?

969
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,180
Well, no, earlier today or yesterday, I think in the morning.

970
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:08,500
Yeah.

971
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:17,660
Basically, being able to achieve thought forms without the words that have been put on you through, you know, culture, family, society.

972
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,800
Well, that's another thing, too, just really quickly.

973
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,400
I mean, the difference between imagery and and words.

974
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:32,260
Right. I mean, if you communicate in pictures, I mean, that's just as valid, if not more than it's called Chinese.

975
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,180
That's funny, but no, I mean, that's true.

976
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,440
The pictograms and so are well, they're antiquated derivatives of pictograms, hieroglyphics to a certain degree.

977
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,780
You know, the oldest writings in Egypt are not hieroglyphics.

978
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,800
There's Sumerian, you know, but they're avoided.

979
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,280
You know, they're not talked about.

980
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,100
I've talked about this a long time ago.

981
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,520
Hieroglyphs were limited for the temples and certain function.

982
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,560
But basically, the cuneiform was the was the Langua Franca and always in Egypt.

983
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,680
Well, while it was depending on when you're talking about in Egypt.

984
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,700
But I would say that images and beyond images, you're ready.

985
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,500
You know, again, the feeling that images give.

986
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:23,800
Right. If you can imagine what you want to do, which is what people are doing anyway.

987
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,140
They just don't acknowledge it.

988
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,200
And that allows the corruption of the words of the inner voices to come in and influence.

989
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,940
Right. So, you know, I imagine people say, well, imagine it done already.

990
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:40,220
Right. They don't say tell yourself it's done already as much as often.

991
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,540
Someone tells you, tell yourself it's done.

992
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,620
It sounds like you're being scammed.

993
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,620
But if someone tells you, imagine that it's already done.

994
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,520
It sounds more cogent, more tangible and more achievable.

995
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:59,700
All right. Well, right. Because imagine you're the image of your you're bringing the image into your mind that this is already.

996
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:05,660
And you kind of said this, you know, when when you want someone to be restored.

997
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,760
Right. We talked about healing with the emo work.

998
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:14,120
And you said, look, what you do is you take them back to the time when they were already in that condition.

999
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,400
And that is the image you put in your mind.

1000
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,720
That's the thing that you're I don't know if you use the word sending, but sending.

1001
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,500
Right. Transmitting, transmitting, projecting, projecting is not a bad word, right?

1002
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,660
No. No. OK. So to project that is the way forward.

1003
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,640
That's how you encourage that to be by already saying it is.

1004
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,460
Yeah. Yeah. OK. Retro causality to an extent.

1005
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,420
Yeah. Retro causality. There you have it.
