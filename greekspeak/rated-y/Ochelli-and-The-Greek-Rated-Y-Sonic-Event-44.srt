1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,900
Sonic Event 44 and here we go, straight to the chat and straight to everything else,

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,940
Grieg, I know you're in an interesting mood tonight.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,920
I love it when you're in an interesting mood.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,100
Anyways, let's get straight to it though.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,640
Some people were asking about certain times and I guess a time of atonement might have

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,460
just went by.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,180
this was what somebody mentioned in the chat.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,840
By the way, moods, Frank Herbert book, dude, gurney, how like

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,400
moods off of children, women and child's play. So anyway, guys

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,620
like reading, dude, I think I paraphrase that might have

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,260
botched it up, but get it. No, no, I looked at the chat. It's

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,240
great that it's active. I like that stuff gets turned inside

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,200
out. I'd rather have it jumping around. I been I read some of

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:02,300
it. It's fine. You know, some people voice quote unquote

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,120
opinions stronger than others. And that's, that's all cool. I'd

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,340
rather have that than even keel lukewarm. What is it called

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,020
lukewarm? Right? So, well, it gets pretty stupid when all you

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,100
hear is Oh, thanks. Thanks. Glad. Thanks. Great. That's not

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,940
all that. I mean, look, it's nice, but it's not how I

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,680
specifically tell people don't send me emails, thanking me

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,440
before it send me something else and you know, real, you

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,380
know, reciprocation. Or don't tell me this stuff is great

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,620
because I already know that otherwise I wouldn't be saying

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,040
it. Oh my gosh, the Greeks got such a high opinion of himself.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,540
Oh my gosh, can I even hear that? It's not me at all. It's

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,980
just the reason I say the stuff I do is because it hasn't been

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,980
said or isn't being said. It's so blaringly obvious. Basically,

28
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,440
the whole thing is, if you're going to talk about a subject,

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,880
but what is no, what can be known about it conveniently, I'm not

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,780
saying be an expert on it, right? But have you as as anyone

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,120
in the population, at large, even conveniently, conveniently

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,720
look back, you know, at anything that they're talking about, you

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,840
know, in terms of what has been referenced or memorialized about

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,240
the subject? The answer is no. Right? Which I want to interject

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,480
something. I put stuff on the background archaics did a pretty

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
good video today about he doesn't really have a handle

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,740
because he thinks the king he well, doesn't have a handle on

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,760
the language and the culture and and other stuff that you guys

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,640
could see better in Greek speak. He did a pretty good video on

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,060
the Phoenix and the horsemen and all that. He's stretching it a

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,440
bit. But I, you know, again, I don't endorse.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,420
No, I know. Just for a point of reference here. Pope's work

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,900
schedule. It's what the 15th of August, right? But what is the

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,880
actual day, by the way? Well, it's the it's the six month,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
right? It's a six month. Yeah. It's about a day off. Yeah.

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,900
Okay. So yeah. Well, that's the seventh or eighth month,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,460
according to the Pope's work schedule, but it's a six months

48
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,040
a day. In other words, right now, it's it's smack in the

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,520
middle of the month, like if you wanted to split hairs about

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,180
it, Monday, Tuesday, right, of August was the first at noon,

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,180
right? solar Monday at noon. Yeah, yeah. Or Yeah, Monday,

52
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,280
Tuesday, actually. Monday, Tuesday at noon, Tuesday at

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
noon, it was over. So it's so funny how you can't just say

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,180
that you have to give a denomination, right? So the

55
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,740
first day of the of the sixth month was between the 31st and

56
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,160
the first, right? Okay. The second day is between the first

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,300
and the second, I just tell people, if you have the regular

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,560
calendar grid, just put a line in between, they actually give

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,740
you lines right where the boxes, you know, where one goes to two

60
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,000
and three goes to four, that that's noontime. Right? It's

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,360
like they almost do you see just count the lines between there,

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,840
right? Yeah. So so if you're looking, for example, on a

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,900
Sabbath, kind of idea, the Sabbath just finished at noon

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,720
today, right? So the Sabbath was between the 14th and the 15th. So

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,000
it's a day off really, sort of. It's it's every seven years, it

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,800
lines up pretty close for one month, by the way. It never

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,160
really lined up because it was three days off last month. Now

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,880
it's a day off. So it never really lines up very rarely,

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,980
right? Well, let me push this question, then what about

70
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,800
atonement and a time of atonement? Okay, it wasn't the

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,200
time of the holiday. Yeah, go ahead. The 10th day of the

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,940
seventh month, 10th day, the seventh month, so that hasn't

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,280
come up trick or treating. Okay. You know, I mean, that's

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,920
wait, wait, wait, Greek, you could. Well, actually, I went to

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,360
a dollar store recently, and I got Halloween stuff up. Yeah,

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,680
yeah, of course. How is that possible? It's isn't it like the

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
end of October, but yet, you know, they keep doing that

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,860
earlier and earlier. Now, you know, yeah, it's one of those.

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,940
So what I mean, that's why I brought that up. Yeah. Now, now

80
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,060
there's a real hard thing about the other side of the world, you

81
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,520
almost have to do double time on that. Because this seems to be

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,740
very agricultural based. The reasoning behind the first month

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,620
is the what's happening in agriculture, right? And the

84
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,640
lower half of the world is is backwards in winter. So I

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,680
suggested that when their spring comes, that's their first month.

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,760
But actually, in terms of like, for time for the what events

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,340
happen in the world, it's going to have to go from this part of

88
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,900
the world, you see. So for example, if you're living in

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,800
Australia, right? It's the 11th month, or it's the sixth month.

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,620
Right? Just in other words, you would take up for our time. But

91
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,800
because it's the 11th, you see, they're going through winter,

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
right? So in other words, when they they do Christmas in

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,660
Australia, it's suntan oil and going to the beach and ice

94
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,880
cream, right? It's the middle of summer, right? Well, since your

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,620
law is partially based on the conditions, I mean, obviously,

96
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,400
you can't have a law ascribed to something, they can't tell you to

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,120
grow things when it's the dead of winter, lawfully.

98
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,900
It's no, no, you could you do is winter, right? No, no. Okay,

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,260
there's, there's stuff that I've come up with, because it's it

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,100
follows the logic and the reasoning in a text, right? So

101
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,940
if you have a book on electricity, or an electrician's

102
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,240
handbook, okay, let's sign an electrician's handbook, what

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,960
electricians do, right? Okay. And so as you're going through

104
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,080
this book, you see things, if you just page open to a page and

105
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,480
read it, it's sort of going to be out of context, if you don't

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,760
know the preface, or the premise of the book, right? Right, you

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,820
have to, right? Because like, imagine you have an

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,240
electrician's handbook, and you just open it and start reading

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,640
it. Yeah, no kidding. It's not going to make a lot of sense.

110
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,020
But you have to remind yourself, this is an electrician's

111
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,000
handbook here. It's talking about number eight wire needs to be

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,260
stripped this way. And you have to get this kind of, but what the

113
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,980
hell is number eight wire? It's no, it doesn't really define

114
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,600
maybe in the appendix, maybe it's not in here. You see, so

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,120
the context of these things are cultural, they're scriptural as

116
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,720
such religious in a way, yes, because you do it regularly. But

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
I want to just instead of getting into this, I'm glad,

118
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,380
you know, we, I had a feeling we're going to be focusing on

119
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,380
the chat. Now, here's the thing I'd like to say, and I'm going

120
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,540
to keep giving an analogy. And then I'm going to get to the

121
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,560
point. Here's an analogy, like I do this with the wife, it never

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,080
works. I do this with other people. It never really works

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,640
very rarely. And this is what it is. You ordered what's called a

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,040
flat pack piece of furniture. It's more than a piece of

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,540
furniture. It's something that has a device built into it,

126
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,680
right? Okay, flat pack is like Ikea, you know, you look at

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,980
stuff, and it looks like nice in the catalog or pleasant in the

128
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,880
catalog, and you go to buy it, it's in a flat box, you got a

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,020
lot of assembly to do, right? Okay. And then there are things

130
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,600
that, you know, you get four or five boxes, like if you order a

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,360
roll top desk on Amazon, a given example, this is a, there's

132
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,780
something like that, or utility, kind of industrial kind of work

133
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,840
table. Okay. And it's got all these other parts to it. Well,

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,300
everything comes in boxes, flats, all the drawers are flat,

135
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,240
it's each drawer has to be assembled each day, you know,

136
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,120
the mechanisms are to be assembled, and the whole thing

137
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
has to be assembled. And the whole thing has to be assembled

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,299
again, because it takes, you know,

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,580
yeah, you put together the drawers, and you put together

140
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,520
the tracks, then you put together the sides and slide the drawers

141
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,840
in. Yeah, of course, right. Yeah. But what if it has other

142
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,580
contraptions inside that articulate? Okay, so this is the

143
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,580
this is what never works. And I've been doing this for decades.

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,380
When it because this is before the flat pack phenomenon. But

145
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,680
I've done it with other things that required instructions or

146
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,040
whatever, like cars or whatever. You're with two or three people,

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,840
let's just make it simple. I'm with someone else. We've got

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,160
this as a project. So I take the instruction manual, and I cut it

149
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,560
in half. If it's 10 pages, I take the first five pages, and

150
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,440
I give the second person page five to 10. I said, Okay, I'll

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,300
read the first half, you read the second half, and we just

152
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,240
separate the parts. So I'll build everything that's in the

153
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,640
first five pages, and you build everything or getting in the

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
last half, and then we'll meet in the middle. Yeah, having done

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,500
this, I already know why it doesn't work. But it doesn't

156
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,600
work at all. But you have to do it in a way where, you know,

157
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,800
they don't overlap, right? Yeah, no, this is the section. So So

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,300
in other words, what ends up happening is, whoever is working

159
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,140
with me stands, there's looking at me asking questions all the

160
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,020
whole time, or can't figure out what they agreed to do. And, but

161
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,260
here's the part where that really pisses me off.

162
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,640
Because they're part of the book, in fairness, they're part

163
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,300
of the book already says, Look, take the take the completed

164
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,920
drawer and do this with it. And you're like, Well, you got to

165
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,140
complete.

166
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,740
That's that would be the presumption you do need to spin.

167
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,180
You can't just randomly cut it in half. Well, but that's what

168
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,720
you need to spend a few minutes. But here, this is what pisses me

169
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,940
off. Okay. So I'm working on the side that I've agreed to do and

170
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,960
the other person's supposed to be working on the other side. And

171
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,600
when I go over, all right, I'll take a pause because nothing's

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,600
happening. And by the way, they tell you, you're in trouble. If

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,280
it tells you the assembly time is two and a half hours, it's more

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,120
like six hours, right? Right? Because remember, unpacking and

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,720
all that and finding laying out all this stuff, right? Yeah,

176
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,020
right. Okay. So I go to the other what the other person's

177
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,080
supposed to be doing. And it's just already there. And all I

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,680
start doing is let's see your problem. Okay, I don't know,

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,960
don't why you're asking me I'm this is foreign to me. It's in

180
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,280
the manual, right? So we go back to the instructions. And we look

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,040
and I say, well, the question you're asking me is right here.

182
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,400
When you have everything you need right there. So what's it?

183
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. Right. And then it goes

184
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,720
on. So it's like, okay, let's put them out. Let's just work

185
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,900
together. You hit, you know, whoever, right? Okay. So now

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,340
instead of having parallel production, it's one person with

187
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,720
a helper. And half the time, the helper doesn't have a lot to do

188
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
they start losing interest, and they don't follow what you're

189
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,860
doing. And they're not much of a helper. So that makes any sense,

190
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,600
right? No, well, that's not like you're doing heart surgery, you

191
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,300
have two nurses handing you an implements, because usually what

192
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,700
happens, you go, look, I got to assemble these six things before

193
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,880
I can put them into the woods. So do you put them those

194
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,260
together, and I'll work on something else. And then yeah,

195
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,300
by the time you get back to it, it's like, did you put those

196
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,320
together yet? Or someone, here's another analogy, someone

197
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,760
sends me a link regarding an event or something. And I'll ask

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,760
later on, I'll ask about it was all in the link. I said, Well,

199
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,020
why don't you How about this when you send a link on the

200
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,900
internet? Okay, don't be so super lazy. I understand that

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,020
you just copy and paste and whatever. That's okay. I get

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,460
that. But go ahead and type out the most important thing why I

203
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,120
should watch it or what's important in that, right? You

204
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,560
get it? Go ahead. And if you care about me enough to send me

205
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,060
a link, why don't you show that you care a little bit more. And

206
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,500
say at this time here at this time marker or something. This

207
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,360
is an important part of the video, right? So guide me along

208
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,140
a little. Okay.

209
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,180
You know why I'm laughing? You know why I'm laughing, though?

210
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,260
Because I do show notes all the time. And I put a headline over

211
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,200
the links. I don't just usually give you a bunch of links. And

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,580
I do show notes, I put a link and I put a headline or the

213
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,700
important part of what you

214
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,620
this is not about. These are just analogies. I'm giving here

215
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,540
on things that I've been noticing. Oh, yeah. But screw

216
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,000
the analogy. I'm telling you, I do this. And then I still get

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,680
people mail to me. Where is this? And I'm like, did you read

218
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,860
we have, we have a human problem. Yes. Okay. So so the

219
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,980
analogy here is that any subject matter is the same. Right? It's

220
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,700
the same formula. Like a lot of times I'll, I'll ride someone on

221
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,980
something. I mean, my riding them. It's like, it's called

222
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,280
yelling at someone right about whatever, right? And I hate

223
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,380
riding people that way. That's a street term. You don't think I

224
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,640
like riding you like this, you know? People keep asking and

225
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm very generous with my time and my effort, whatever. But when

226
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,280
I start seeing that it's beyond the subject matter, and it has

227
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,580
nothing to do with the subject matter, but has to do with basic

228
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,160
function. Now, we have to start weeding things out, which leads

229
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,060
to the next point. Now we'll get more of the juicy stuff. So

230
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,260
spiritual, everyone still is stuck in this thing about

231
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,620
spiritual. So when you look at some of the definitions that

232
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,520
I've put out, actually, heaven forbid, you look at the

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,900
definitions that are put out by others on spirit, soul and body,

234
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,580
because it's, they're just following the confusion, right?

235
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Yeah. And sidestepping. You know, it's like 911. Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,740
Yeah, it was a weapon from space. Yeah. But you know, I

237
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,700
could be a technical witness. In other words, if I went to a

238
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,600
court, I could be a technical witness and sit at the stand and

239
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,180
tell you technically exactly what happened, just like you

240
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,240
know, the higher technical witnesses for in court, right?

241
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,540
I can do that for 911. I could tell you exactly what happens

242
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,560
with the atomic or nuclear demolition that was thermonuclear

243
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,300
everything to look for. So I had to be that right? Technically,

244
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,200
I could do it any day of the week, even in my sleep, but

245
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,760
people still insist that it's a space weapon or dynamite on all

246
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,360
the floors, which is impossible and all that stuff, right? So so

247
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,840
there's that aspect to it. So what I mean about definitions,

248
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,900
I've gotten to the point where I've been a technical witness to

249
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,520
the definitions of spirit, soul and body. But it sounds easy to

250
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,960
break up those three things into three compartments very neat and

251
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,700
tidy. But this is the but when you describe someone when you

252
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,920
judge someone when you interact with someone when you have a

253
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,180
feeling for someone, that is mostly with their spirit. When

254
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,280
you hear someone say something when you see someone's behavior,

255
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,540
when you have someone approach you or depart from you, that is

256
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,060
mostly their spirit animating all that. The part of the soul

257
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,080
that is animating it is basically are they breathing and

258
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,900
walk and as their heart beating and their nervous system and

259
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,340
elimination working and metabolism working and the body

260
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,580
well, the big but again, anyway, did I say big but okay, but the

261
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,060
body part? Yeah, the big but but right, yeah. Okay, the body is

262
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,660
the butt, right? Anyway, is the body and that has a strong

263
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,860
effect also, but it has effect on what your spirit and then

264
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,440
your body, right? So the majority of interactions that people have

265
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,540
actually animals even more in some cases, right? Is with

266
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,740
someone else's spirit. What someone says what someone does

267
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,220
what someone how someone behaves, how they dress that

268
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,640
morning, and how they how much cologne or how little cologne

269
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,380
or they put on is based on their spirit, their mind. So when

270
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,080
people say they want to have a spiritual discussion, or talk

271
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,880
about the spirit, if I'm in a mood, certain mood, and I say,

272
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,120
Hey, moron, right? Am I addressing their body? Am I

273
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,480
addressing their heartbeat? Or am I addressing their spirit?

274
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,340
When I say that their mind, you see, I think on some level, it's

275
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,220
coming from a place where you're interpreting all of that

276
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,260
combined. And it's about your reaction to that. No, no, no,

277
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,819
listening. No, I'm not listening. Okay. The spirit. Okay, if you

278
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,200
look at the body, the butt, anyway, and if you look at the

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,540
soul, which is the metabolism, literally, at this point, we can

280
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,440
have people that are all comatose, laying down, imagine a

281
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,800
football, a big room with 1000 beds, and everyone's not hooked

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,319
up to IVs, but they're all sleeping or in a coma. They have

283
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,680
a functioning soul, because they're alive and breathing,

284
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,020
right? No, the metabolism is working, and they have a body.

285
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,820
Does that make it more clear? You see? Now, anything else

286
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,720
beyond being comatose or catatonic or asleep? Right? You

287
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,960
get it is a reaction to the spirit, and driven by the

288
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,340
spirit. I hope that made it more clear. I can't I don't know, I

289
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,320
could I'm trying to think of stronger analogies. So the

290
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,180
analogy here is this anything, anything, any form of

291
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,000
communication between two beings, appearances, again, judgments,

292
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,840
desires, repulsions, repugnance, hatred, love, everything you can

293
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,380
imagine interacting with something, someone else is a

294
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,560
spiritual interaction. So when people say, Well, I'll talk

295
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,300
about the spirit. I'm like, Okay, let's go the other way. What is

296
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,140
not spiritual? Well, if it if it's deciding on how do we make

297
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,420
a description of 1000s of people laying down asleep or in a coma

298
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,560
that are still alive, that would be the only thing that would

299
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,120
solely basically encompass the soul and the body. The moment

300
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,040
there's animation, and distinct personality and distinct

301
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,120
behavior, or even if they all act, you know, what is it called

302
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,980
synchronistic swimming or synchronically cheerleaders use

303
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,980
synchronous actions, right? Yes, you're synchronistic. So you can

304
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,620
have synchronistic actions also, right? That is all spiritual.

305
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,240
And otherwise, it's driven by the mind. Give me an example. Let's

306
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,980
say the the synchronous, what do they call those things? pom poms

307
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,440
that they move the cheerleaders, they do the kick does, you know,

308
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,600
they do a dance. So synchronous routine. Sure. routine. Okay.

309
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,100
Let me ask, let me say this. If one of their souls and body

310
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,920
become corrupt, let's say one of them suddenly has an epileptic

311
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,660
fit. Right? That is so overcoming to the spirit that

312
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,720
they that will they'll just collapse and fall over like a lot

313
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,140
of these vaccine videos are players. They don't know why

314
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,960
they're dying suddenly, right? kind of thing. The body and the

315
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,940
soul are overcome. They no longer no longer functions and the

316
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,560
spirit can no longer function. Again, it goes back to the

317
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,060
original definition. So when people want to have a spiritual

318
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,300
discussion, tell me what is not spiritual. Basically, it's

319
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,340
people in a coma or sleeping. So when you say you want to have a

320
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,920
spiritual discussion, the only thing that gets ruled out of

321
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,960
that, as people that are in a coma or sleeping, everything

322
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,420
else is included. Holy crap.

323
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,760
Sounds to me like everything that involves interaction is

324
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,060
therefore spiritual. Yeah.

325
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,580
And I've been saying this for the longest time. And years ago,

326
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,640
when I started interacting with people on the internet, and

327
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,400
well, specifically, they bring up, oh, he's so spiritual. I'm

328
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,560
like, that doesn't tell me. But spiritually, in a good way, bad

329
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,940
way. What? What do you mean? It's a good thing to be

330
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,680
spiritual. I said, Well, demons are spiritual.

331
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,820
Yeah, that's a very dumb dad. Exactly. It's a very dumb dad.

332
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,360
That's like saying you're very political. So what does that

333
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,360
mean? You know, it means nothing business of the state. Yeah,

334
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,960
it's the business of the state. Right. But that's but you give

335
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,800
me no idea about the character of the individual when you say

336
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
they're political. You know what I'm saying? You have no idea

337
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,040
what it is they're actually involved in or what it is.

338
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,320
So it's very so I don't know, I feel like this. You know, this

339
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,580
is like something where you need to shotgun it. You know, I don't

340
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,140
know if you guys have been around hunting. You go out with

341
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,120
someone hunting and even if they're 20 feet away, and they

342
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,100
have a shotgun rifle to depending on the caliber, then

343
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,780
they shoot it. And you're not ready for it. Oh, crap. It's

344
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,820
just really shocks you. Right? It's just so it's, yeah, it's

345
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,140
power. It's very dynamic, right? Like you've been near a car, two

346
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,100
cars crashing at speed, you know, stuff like that. And this

347
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,780
kind of stuff needs to be transmitted that way. So it

348
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,700
sticks. And what it does is it raises the person's

349
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,460
consciousness of their awareness of everything that they're doing

350
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,200
around them. Now, I don't know how to emphasize it. If you want

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,380
to emphasize it, can you give a key? Do you want to take the

352
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,340
credit? I'm going to toss it over to you. Well, I'm on the

353
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,980
subject. How would you describe? No, that that that sounds great.

354
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,140
And look, to say that it's just you know, a spiritual that that

355
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,260
is too general. Again, it is not a specific thing. Like I said,

356
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,760
political. So, you know, when you were or the idiotic

357
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,320
compliment given where somebody says you're, you're very

358
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,360
intellectual, you know, give another analogy regarding the

359
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,140
spirit, because it's basically the mind and anything that the

360
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,460
mind is guiding and behavior or community or anything is the

361
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,560
spirit this right? Well, there's no way to separate those two

362
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,120
things. So the mind and the spirit, it is the same thing.

363
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,380
It's like kind of can you separate them two equals to how

364
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,720
do you separate the two? Well, that's what I'm saying. It's

365
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,460
like, exactly. Look, you can't separate these things. They're

366
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,120
not separate components. Well, it's just different words for the

367
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,040
same thing psyche, right? There you go. psychological PSY

368
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,440
prefix is the spirit. And they've just split they've,

369
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,320
they've, it's this has always been done. This has been done

370
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,540
throughout history, where all you got to do is mess up the

371
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,720
definitions, right? Well, pranks are based on that, right?

372
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,200
When you're going to prank someone, right? Of course, the

373
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,840
prank, the actual prank itself, right, is a duality that is not

374
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,880
recognized as such. It's recognized, you know, here's a

375
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,520
chair, and there's a thumbtack on it, right? You don't know, you

376
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,820
didn't say here's a chair with a thumbtack. Did you? No, you

377
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,700
just said, here's a chair.

378
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,860
No, you let them run into the problem. It's just like throwing

379
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,160
the firecracker in the crowd is same kind of thing.

380
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,860
Where the other day I was a woman says, Have a nice day. So

381
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,980
you do, by the way, there's no ticket, it's a time to check

382
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,780
out. Do you know what the word nice means? She had to look at

383
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,760
she looked it up. I said, Look it up. You have a stupid

384
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,000
rectangle. So what's that? Oh, my gosh, you've been a victim of

385
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,080
it then. Anyway, she looks it up. It takes me like, oh, quite a

386
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,980
while to walk her through Adam. She reads it. Because Oh, that's

387
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,280
very interesting. Well, have a nice day anyway.

388
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,020
etymology. So she goes to etymology online and looks at

389
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,800
it. And it basically, you know, is

390
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,080
sending so many people there. Now they're starting to put the

391
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,000
geography on the stupid rectangle. They put the

392
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,440
geography for nice the place, right? Yeah, France, right. They

393
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,340
put that first to kind of throw people off, you know, good. All

394
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,800
right. So. So here's the thing about that. All right, let's

395
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,520
jump over to the gods. Let's jump over. Let's make a jump

396
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
here. Okay, so

397
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,240
want to spend two hours repeating,

398
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,740
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let you but I'm not gonna let you get

399
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,980
away without addressing the word atonement. But go ahead, go to

400
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,980
the gods. Because just look it up. It's actually keep putting

401
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,780
which means to cover in the Hebrew, the word is kippur, which

402
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,240
means to cover. I don't think atonement is a really good

403
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,940
selection to translate.

404
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,400
Okay, well, that would be the reason why they use Yom Kippur

405
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,700
as the right for the name of the holiday.

406
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,860
Yeah, there you go. Kippur is a cover. Yeah. Okay. And it's a

407
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,580
cover like the cover of the box, you know, the Ark of the

408
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,060
Covenant, right? I probably just butchered which, by the way,

409
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,940
doesn't there is no image, public image of what is directed to be

410
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,280
built in the Bible in existence, by the way. I've never found

411
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,480
one. No, if you in other words, if you study how to build it,

412
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,160
make it draw have an eight year old or and then have a

413
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,420
professional artist, as you're giving the description of what

414
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,640
it should look like, they'll both come up with the same thing.

415
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,240
It's very simple. And you'll and then you'll look at the images

416
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,160
online and nothing looks like it. And you're like, well, is it

417
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,500
so easy to deceive people?

418
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,200
Yeah, none of the artists and none of the artists renderings

419
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,580
or whatever, are anywhere near what should be no, no, not at

420
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,200
all. Yeah. So okay, so yeah, let's let's drop the Day of

421
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
Atonement thing. I didn't see that up there. But okay, so

422
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,920
you brought it up enough. Let me just say something in terms of

423
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,880
timekeeping appointment times and all that. Let's say we're

424
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,980
going to be lawful in terms of the not in the strictest legal

425
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,220
sense. But let's say we're going to be lawful. Because when we say

426
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,420
that in these in this type of forum, let's say, with Greek

427
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,680
speak and stuff, I'm referring to biblical stuff. It could

428
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,040
also sometimes be other stuff. But it doesn't work when you go

429
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,420
out into the world. Because when you say lawful, they think

430
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,980
you're talking about the legal system, right? You know, which

431
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,300
is not lawful, right? And they tell you that it's awful. But

432
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,340
anyway, okay, so we're going to be lawful, even from a loose

433
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,020
point. I've been saying this for three decades. Now, I do not

434
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,600
really announce things that much, because I'm not a priest. That

435
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,060
was a priestly function. Okay, so let's dumb it down. Let's dumb

436
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,960
it down. Let's say we're Catholics. And this is a

437
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,820
Catholic forum. And we're talking about butts. No, anyway.

438
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,400
So not the first thing I look at personally. That's the word of

439
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,000
the night. Okay, so children's butts, of course, for the

440
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Catholic priest. The cardinals. Yeah, yeah. Get it. Anyway.

441
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,920
Let's say we're talking about that. Am I fit to baptize? Am I

442
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,120
fit to give communion to Greek for talking about it? Am I in a

443
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,120
position to do that? Well, no. According to their creed? Yeah.

444
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,200
Right. Who does that? Right? The priest has to do that. Yeah,

445
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,560
right. So when when we're going to adhere, I'm not saying

446
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,180
dogmatically, I don't really get into Oh, it's the Sabbath. Oh,

447
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,700
it's this holiday. Oh, it's this. Well, you know, I'll

448
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,640
occasionally do that. I'd like to see what other people do with

449
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,560
it. Because I'm not a priest. And actually, I'm going to stand

450
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,220
that. Well, am I a teacher? Well, once you find the

451
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,320
principle, and all that now you can teach it. So if you can

452
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,400
teach it, why am I the teacher? You get it? Well, again, at any

453
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,300
given time, as we've discussed before, anyone can teach you

454
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,640
something even. And we get enough information from them

455
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,780
where you can teach it now. They're a teacher. So there's a

456
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,760
level here. It's kind of like splitting the instruction

457
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,420
manual and half thing again. Right. So here's the point. I'm

458
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,020
not adamant about doing these things. I do practice I do

459
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,840
observe, right? Because I've noticed there are very subtle

460
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,480
changes that happen when you do that. In other words, when you

461
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,640
when those appointed times and days come around, there are

462
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,980
changes in the natural world, believe it or not, that you can

463
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,560
focus on and spiritual, you know, the very subtle, subtle

464
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,280
doesn't mean weak, by the way, subtle could be strong. Okay, all

465
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,840
of the high level energetic work doesn't blow someone waves their

466
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,580
hands and knock someone down. With that power. It's subtle,

467
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,000
strength is not obvious at all points in time, you may not be

468
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,620
aware that somebody like you've seen the guy who doesn't look

469
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,280
like very much, but winds up being able to kick the hell out

470
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,000
of some bigger guy. And nobody knew that he had those skills

471
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,860
until right. So the reason why I observed the law and do all of

472
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,060
that is because in the beginning, three decades ago,

473
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,020
when I was made aware of it, I said, Well, how can I knock it if

474
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,120
I don't try it. And when I tried it, I saw it was subtle, but

475
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,540
powerful. So I decided to make it my law form, and the way I

476
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,820
function, but I'm not a priest in any capacity. Neither do I want

477
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,540
to be. Right. So that's why there is not now the rest of it,

478
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,800
there's no problem in discussing it as a forum. But when someone

479
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,700
comes to me with it, like I think Randy did about the months and

480
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,660
all that I said, it's really both and I have to think about

481
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,320
I've always brought it up. It's both because the the the the

482
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,120
world the alarm as it is in Hebrew works around that part of

483
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,420
the world where right now it's the nearing summer end of

484
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,480
summer, not quite but late part of summer, where the other part

485
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,500
of the world is in the late part of winter. So I would say that

486
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,720
world events and all that will be based around what's happening

487
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,500
up here, right versus down there. But because it's

488
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
agricultural, you're, you're, you're double timing it, right?

489
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,140
You see, you're gonna have to do both. I don't know there. It's

490
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,120
never been addressed. And I can't again, I think that would

491
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,580
be a priestly call. Right. So, okay. So

492
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,620
it seems to me it could be equally logical that in that

493
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,840
part of the world, it just the world flows differently. Okay.

494
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,100
And therefore, events could be it's, it's reverse. Yeah. So

495
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,860
it's viewed in that way. So therefore, you know, this may be

496
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,620
the time when harvest has already occurred and all that

497
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,840
stuff, because it's winter, it's winter. So the end of winter

498
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,540
renting, entering probably the Yeah, it's not spring is about

499
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,440
more than a month away. That's why I've never been dissatisfied

500
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,540
with the title of pagan because I assert myself as someone who

501
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,560
was doing his best to be ignorant. No, it's all believe

502
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,640
believe it or not, it's all the same. It's just what level

503
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,600
you're functioning on. Right. But I am doing my best to adhere

504
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
to the world around me. Now, if I was in Australia, I would do

505
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,180
my best to adhere to that, you know? Well, no, it's what level

506
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,960
you're operating. Okay, it's for example, like a pagan knows you

507
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,560
shouldn't murder, right? Someone who's a biblical lawful, you

508
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,400
know, as you shouldn't murder. Well, why did why did they both

509
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,700
know the same thing? Somehow? The ones that pay any other ones

510
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,240
that was just different levels. Well, even if you don't know how

511
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,100
to read, you may be aware that there is a book that says you

512
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,460
shouldn't do that. And you might be aware that it's not a good

513
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,960
thing to do. Yeah, but it also gives you a lot of other reasons

514
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,020
on what happens if you do and how to remedy and yeah, pagans

515
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,880
don't have that. And they might do an extent depending on what

516
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,640
level you want to see my posture isn't even about it's wrong to

517
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,340
murder. It's wrong to do harm. You're not supposed to seek to

518
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,040
do harm. That's all there is to it. Harm is not something you

519
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,560
should be seeking to do. This is not your place in the world.

520
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,860
Okay, that that is as simple as I can bring it down from a pagan

521
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,620
philosophy. And that that is accurate to me, don't harm. And

522
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,360
that covers all that other stuff. You see if you steal, I

523
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,980
guess, but what I'm saying is, it's different operates on

524
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,260
different levels. Okay, maybe I'm operating on a technical

525
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,680
Yeah, well, maybe I'm operating on a very, you know, limited

526
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,380
level there, but I still stand by it. Because I mean, not you,

527
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,740
but that's typically what I seen. And now if we went back or

528
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,220
in private circles, paganism is very different. I got pretty

529
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,860
familiar with a lot of the practices. And there were not

530
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,340
really that difficult from biblical, it's just but the

531
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,560
direction was different. Okay, so let's get into the gods.

532
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Let's get into the gods real quick. And okay, so when you say

533
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,220
the gods, that's a various sundry term, a various garden variety

534
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,240
term, very garden variety term. So specifically, you'll see

535
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
there are various various pantheons, right? Throughout

536
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,120
throughout history. And there haven't been too many pantheons

537
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,480
created recently. I mean, in the past 2000 years, not

538
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,920
officially, no, there's no official canonized sort of like

539
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,880
here it is the pantheon of because supposedly, we're in a

540
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,420
time of the individual, the singular God. Well, there might

541
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,780
be sort of religion religions that have been created, like

542
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,940
from Muhammad, peace be upon him. After that, but I wouldn't

543
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,080
consider that a pantheon because it actually refers, by the way,

544
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,900
in the Quran, I think Syria 26 or 28. It says that if you want

545
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,900
to know the law of Allah, it's was given to Moses. Yeah. So how

546
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,940
many Muslims put the Quran down right there and then go read? You

547
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,980
get my point, right? Okay, so

548
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,480
now some of them do exactly that.

549
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,320
None of them. I've never run into anyone who's done that.

550
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,160
I'm not saying some, there might be some Yeah, it's like, but

551
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,240
it's some like, you know, they when you buy orange juice, they

552
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,540
got oranges, then they got oranges with pulp, and then they

553
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,800
got oranges with some pulp. Anyway. Okay. I had to

554
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,139
trivialize it. So it's fine. It's fine. It's Yeah, you get it.

555
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,760
Get the point. That would be something in the middle. The the

556
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,719
not Pope, Pope. But anyway, various sundry, various sundry

557
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,659
gods and all in the pantheons. Okay. So here's the point. How

558
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:29,600
do you make a judgment? Well, the ones giving you the most

559
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,320
information are probably the more higher order ones. And the

560
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,800
ones that give you the least information are the opposite of

561
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,780
higher, right? Very, very simple. Now, I don't believe in

562
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,960
any of this. Right? I've come to the point where I begin to

563
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,000
know what's been memorialized, whether it's actually done or

564
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,400
written by Moses, or this was fake or that way. That's okay.

565
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,380
I know the text doesn't matter. It's like if you want to have if

566
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,260
you want it, someone wants to say that it's fictional, and

567
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,180
whatever it says, that's okay. So if we have a discussion on

568
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,800
Moby Dick, we really can't unless we read the book by

569
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,320
Melville, right? So do we want to argue that we can have a

570
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,700
discussion on Moby Dick without knowing anything that was

571
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,480
written by Melville? Can we can we do that? Should we do that?

572
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,300
Would that even sound right? No, it doesn't. Right? Well, it

573
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,040
doesn't accomplish much. That's for sure. You actually, that's

574
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,340
the whole world is functioning on that premise, by the way. So

575
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,240
so I found the there's lawful stuff in the Bible, the guides

576
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
and histories and things that pan out, they pan out reality,

577
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,260
if you do them, and you study it, right. So that's where I'm

578
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,160
at with that. Right? It's it's better than what in the 80s. Oh,

579
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,540
red meat is bad. Here's pork, the other white meat, right. And

580
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,180
then it was that it was all grilling is bad for your causes

581
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,920
because shit carcinogen, you know, cancer carcinogens, right

582
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,520
in the charcoal.

583
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,960
He everybody drink a gallon of milk, every everybody drink a

584
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,100
gallon of milk a day. Oh, wait, don't drink the milk. Oh, wait,

585
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,900
eat, eat 20 eggs a day. Oh, wait, don't eat eggs. Yeah, I

586
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,380
know all that.

587
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Yeah, I'm not gonna Yeah, I realize that's a farce. And by

588
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,540
the way, you know, I think I brought this up before you drink

589
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,480
you drink, you take dairy products, some people could be a

590
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,260
piece of cheese causes depression in humans, by the

591
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,880
way. I wouldn't say that emphatically. But now that I've

592
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,420
said that, and if you can remember that pay attention, do

593
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,480
you hear about people being depressed? So yeah, on a side

594
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,140
note, do you consume dairy? How much dairy do you consume? Oh, my

595
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,040
gosh, you're gonna be shocked to find out.

596
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,560
Well, anytime I get tired is always when I've consumed either

597
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,820
a some dairy or be some bird.

598
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm talking about the psychological aspect of what

599
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
people say, I'm depressed, you know, I'm feeling, you know,

600
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,920
low energy, the world sucks, this and that, right?

601
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,740
My association with being tired.

602
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,600
The psychological aspect of label, which is all whatever,

603
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,360
but I'm just saying, right, right. Because that's still a

604
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,900
big deal. What that was a big deal in the 90s, depression,

605
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,960
number of pills and all that. So of course, 2000s also. So I

606
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,720
function on that level. And I consider myself normal, the high

607
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,080
functioning human, right? I mean, above normal, high

608
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,600
functioning. And I think anyone can be it's just a choice. And

609
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,200
it takes extra work. It's just like if you go to the gym, you

610
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,120
have high funk people that are high functioning in the gym. And

611
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,260
you got people that are not so high functioning, right? It's

612
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,320
very simple, right? You know, you play tennis, this guy's really

613
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,020
high function, right? Look at your ass, right? If you play

614
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,260
them, right? And there are people that are not so high, but

615
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,500
because they just need to practice more, spend more time,

616
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,340
you see, that's what I mean by that. So this is the whole

617
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,980
aspect of everything. So let's say we have a discussion like

618
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,360
we've had on whatever various topics, even when it gets rude,

619
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,580
crass, and lascivious, guess what, if it has anything to do

620
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:53,300
with people behaving in any way talking, or doing anything at

621
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,520
all, that is a guess what, this type of discussion, it's a

622
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,340
spiritual discussion. You want to discuss what you saw on TV

623
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,700
last night, on cable, whatever. Guess what? That's a spiritual

624
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,560
discussion. All of it is spiritual, although it's rather

625
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,980
shallow, because you're not actually interacting with an

626
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,600
individual, you're actually interacting with the

627
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,740
representation of an individual, and therefore things shift a

628
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,960
little bit. But still, it's a shallow spiritual discussion,

629
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,620
right? Yep. So here, let's go back to the gods. I haven't seen

630
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,720
any gods around lately, tell me they're gods or anybody with a

631
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,120
t shirt, I'm a god. No, the only thing that I can interact with

632
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,300
that is the information based on how I should live my life, and

633
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,060
tell others if they want, if they want to hear it, right? If

634
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,540
they want to hear it. And, and I never tout the benefits of it.

635
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,860
Never, because it's not about winning or losing or benefiting

636
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,600
or worsening oneself. It's a it's a choice that you make based

637
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,020
on how you want to function. I find personally, there are

638
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,880
benefits to it much more. The benefit for me is you have a

639
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,520
very well organized system that actually works. You know, so

640
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,080
let's go back to the gods. There are various sundry guys. I mean,

641
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,020
I mean, there's got to be at least 10 Jesus's, right? I don't

642
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,520
even like using that word. I mean, maybe I know there's like

643
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,320
three or four major Jesus's, right? Okay. None of them are

644
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,500
biblical, by the way, you know, the one that, you know, if you

645
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,600
don't follow me, you're gonna burn in hell, the one with the

646
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,180
bleeding heart. The other one that says everything's been done

647
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,080
away with the blood of the lamb, right? Okay. If you don't believe

648
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,500
in me, whatever, you know, this is so many different types. They

649
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,400
got the black one, right? They got the white one. They got the

650
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,980
Middle Eastern one, they got the one with dirty blonde blue eyes,

651
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,860
the one with curly brown, brown eyes on Hollywood, right? So

652
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:53,040
which one is none of them, right? And when you say God, I

653
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,220
say dog, I mean, either way, because you're not saying

654
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,980
anything. When you say that there's a you have to be more

655
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,000
specific, more specific. Yeah. So on that case, it would be our

656
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
way of the Bible. Now he's got a lot of friends, he's got a lot

657
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,140
of enemies. So that's your pick. That's what you what you're

658
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,320
going to do, who's your deity, right? So it's very simple. But

659
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,340
there are so many of them. And I ain't running into any of them

660
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,500
lately. But what's interesting is that on whatever level you

661
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,160
want to function, you're going to need an operating system,

662
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,140
some programs and files to run off of, right. And if you don't

663
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,980
have someone, you'll get them. Even if you don't have them,

664
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,720
you'll still get them, you just will be it'll be unawares,

665
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,260
right. So in essence, what I have to say about the gods is

666
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,900
very simple. When you approach the subject, of whether it's a

667
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,400
pantheon or a single God, what are they providing for you in

668
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,600
terms of instruction, let's say there are higher functioning than

669
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,400
humans are. So don't you want to kind of kick back something to

670
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,980
the lower creatures, you know, the humans about, hey, this is

671
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,240
about, you know, this is how you eat, this is how you do this,

672
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,540
this is how you do that. Right. And if you look at the gods, see

673
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,600
who's kicking information, what are they trafficking in? Right?

674
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,120
What are they selling you? What are they giving you? That's

675
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,160
that's it. Basically, that's the entire discussion. You know, the

676
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,780
you know,

677
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,700
well, the weird thing is that, honestly, though, and to my

678
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,920
horror, I discover over the years that people hear exactly

679
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,000
what they want to. And it is usually they only hear the

680
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,320
things that they want to hear. It doesn't matter necessarily

681
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,660
what you've said, what you've tried to impart, what you've

682
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,060
tried to combine into a discussion. It can be most

683
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,540
profound when you've said very little, because they heard it

684
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,060
that way.

685
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,880
Well, that's just like sex, the type of sex and how much sex and

686
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,800
who to have sex and this and that is all based on how you were

687
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,200
raised. And the culture that you live in. Right. And even if

688
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,800
they want to hear what they want to hear, that word want is

689
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,260
kind of funky, because they're actually told what they should

690
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:16,260
want. Think about it. Right? Look at children. When you ask, I

691
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,220
don't know, let's say, girls between six and 12. Ask them

692
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,040
what they want. I bet you 99% of the time, it's something that is

693
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,080
in vogue, trendy, whatever that's targeting that age group

694
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,820
in the kids culture at the moment. 99% of the time. Most

695
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,940
right. No one's gonna find a six to nine or 12 year old girl

696
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,020
say, ask her what he wants. I want a unicorn or I want a pink

697
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,240
elephant. Never. It's always going to be something that they

698
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,360
saw. That was pushed to them. Right. So how do they know when

699
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,380
they say I want this particular doll or this particular

700
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,440
fashionable whatever shirt? How do they know about that? How do

701
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
they how do they know that they want that? Well, it was what they

702
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,900
found about right? It was pushed up.

703
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,940
So it was either pushed on or yeah, or at some point, it was

704
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,020
pushed on them. And they had a minor experience like, you know,

705
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,440
they've decided they want cookies and candy. And the reason is

706
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,740
because they've had some cookies and candy because that was

707
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,660
pushed on candies, it's going to be something that they was made

708
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,500
they were made familiar with or promoted to them anyway, of

709
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,580
course, and they're not going to say, like, for example, you know,

710
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,220
you have, you know, the little crispy snacks. They get the

711
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,060
crisps, they call them in England, they do call them

712
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,260
potatoes, always crispy side. Okay, if you go to Asia, when

713
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,340
children get crispy snacks, it's dehydrated shrimp and fish.

714
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,920
Okay, right. There's the pork rind thing. Also, I know that's

715
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,000
popular right here. But that would be the closest. But you

716
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
don't see Westerners saying, Oh, I want a bag of chips or a

717
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,640
bag, you know, give me the dried shrimp. They would say, Oh,

718
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,440
that's gross, right? Because anyone who's had fish food, you

719
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,020
know, that, you know, the little dried shrimp, you throw in the

720
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,340
fish tank, whatever. Okay, so it's your culture. And how you

721
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,000
were made to want to believe things. That's why it's more

722
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,560
important to develop the individual well rounded. Right?

723
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,780
Before they start wanting like I have no wants, I have needs. And

724
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,940
my body knows I like when I use the stomach kind of feels kind

725
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,300
of tingy, it's making a really loud noise. And I've been

726
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,460
telling it to go away. I did the email work after a while it did.

727
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,740
But after a few days, Chuck, I found out that need has to be

728
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,500
satisfied. You know, right? It's stomach's making noise, and

729
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,000
it's distracting. Right? I could I could keep it off for a while.

730
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,200
Days even. But after a while, I got a sad, you know, I have to

731
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,060
fulfill that need. You see what I mean? But it's not like, I feel

732
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,940
a slight hunger or I haven't eaten in eight hours, I better

733
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,720
eat something has a big difference there. Right? So

734
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,380
there's an interesting point there where look, spiritual

735
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,260
things are a need of and a function of the being. And the

736
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,260
fact is, if you don't seek them out and decide what to put in

737
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,000
there, at some point, you'll be directed to put something in

738
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,100
there anyway. Regardless of whether you chose it, it might

739
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,720
just be the thing pushed on you as well.

740
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,800
Yeah, well, most likely, that's actually what you're being not

741
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,600
only what you're being made aware of, but what you're being made

742
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,380
aware of, and you consider to be important, which is different

743
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,400
for everyone to a degree.

744
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,660
So there you have
