1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,310
It's like a submarine. Okay.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,750
Somebody's got to do it.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,430
Oh, I got the house. I got so much custom shit built in here.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,470
Nah, I would figure you would. I mean, just out of boredom, you'd probably do that.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:13,790
Never bored.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,390
Never?

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,790
How can you be bored?

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,630
Wait a minute, you're never bored? You're never bored?

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,370
Never. We'll talk about that.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,710
So you don't find the foolishness of other people boring?

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,730
No, absolutely we're gonna, yes.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,850
Go, go, go. All right, come on, hit the button or something, man.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,810
Yeah.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,830
SonicEvent45, Ocelli here and TheGreek also. How you doing, man?

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,190
Hey, I'm doing what else am I supposed to be doing?

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,210
So right before and as I was pressing record, actually, because I started recording before

17
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,490
I played the intro, just a fair game to you, I'm telling you. I said, come on, you're never bored.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,530
I don't know if I recorded that part, but you're never bored. Being around people that you know

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,450
are not caught up to what you're caught up to are not as informed as you are.

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,090
You don't get bored with that?

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,090
You can repeat that 10 times. I'll take it 10 different ways.

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:26,730
Okay.

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,070
You know what I mean? Here's number two.

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:30,970
Go ahead.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,870
You see what I mean?

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,110
Right. And I'll leave it at that.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,990
Okay.

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,450
You know, you've heard, look, if you're familiar with Greek speak, it's about, okay,

29
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,030
you know, when you're assessing a diamond, right? Do they just look at it and put it away?

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,230
Or does it count how many cuts and facets they're on there and see what you view through each one?

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,970
Yeah, of course. They take, they take a couple of notes. They pull out a couple of different

32
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,010
jewelers loops. At least they used to, I don't know. Maybe there's a machine for that now,

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,530
as far as I know. But the last time I was around somebody, they use little loops, you know?

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,090
And yeah, I've got them. I've got all of them. People think the higher the magnification,

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,789
the better you see it. I loops are so subjective. Yeah. I've got some really nice ones. Those

36
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,350
really cheap ones. And the really cheap ones work just as well as the really good ones.

37
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,950
You see, now you're striking on something that I'm extremely familiar with, because as you well

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,190
know, I use a lot of devices to try and assist my vision. And you probably are not familiar with

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,130
those things because we've never discussed it, but I'm sitting at the office here. I got one

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,050
right here. I just opened it. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm in my sixth decade. So are you perhaps. And

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,230
you know, eyesight is something of contention as these whippersnappers get older, right?

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,470
Yeah. Well, I, but I started out from a bad place. So I was getting familiar with the magnifying

43
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,450
glasses and stuff when I was like five and six years old. And the truth is that the stuff made

44
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,290
by Bausch and Lomb is just as good as that stuff they make in Japan, which is, you know, what?

45
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,490
500 bucks, I think is the, the cheapest thing that they sell that one catalog. You ever see

46
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,950
that, that one catalog that does nothing but optical solutions? No, no, but we'll check it out.

47
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,490
Well, there's that. And then there's the Americanized thing. They call it the lighthouse

48
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,210
catalog. It has a whole bunch of optical aids. Maybe you've seen that one. Nope. I haven't been

49
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,590
pursuing them. What I do is I go into a lapidary supply and get it from there. I'll give a plug

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,410
for these guys, Kent tools. You know how I gave a plug for the star gems here in Tucson. They're

51
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,170
only people you could really quickly get inexpensive silver. Oh yeah. By the way,

52
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,090
they're going out of business. They're internet only, which I think will make it easier. Oh,

53
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,750
wow. Because before you had, it was old school. You call, they wrote it down on a slip, you know,

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,990
maybe you got it. Maybe you don't, you know, you always got it, but it's now it'll be internet

55
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:47,350
only, uh, Kent tools, K E N T lapidary supply in Tucson. Um, uh, they've got over a million

56
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,510
things in stock, a different, not a million of one thing, but a million different things

57
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,770
for working on small things to, you know, anything that works with metal jewelry,

58
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,390
X, whatever. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent people. Excellent supply. Very inexpensive.

59
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,410
Um, you can get anything. Uh, and that's where I go for that. But yeah, I'm not optically

60
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,209
challenged to the point where I believe you might say you have been. So I can't say that I've gone

61
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,390
down the same, you know, similar path. I understand. It's just that I've used machines. I've used stuff

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,790
that projects. I've used things that put it up on TV screens. You know, I used to have a great book.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,270
I would say a camera hooked up to a flat screen is good for everyone. That's excellent. Uh,

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,730
and Stevie wonder actually, uh, was partially responsible for developing some of the reader

65
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,450
technology that people now use, you know, that, that, that stuff that reads, uh, you you've seen

66
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,290
that before where you can actually have your computer read an article to you. Uh, audio audio

67
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,390
wise, kind of scary, but yeah. Yeah. I don't, there's something too artificial still about it.

68
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,610
Yeah. Well, Stevie wonder came up with a way of taking that kind of technology and putting it on

69
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,990
a book actually. And it's strange because it sort of disappeared, uh, but it was out there for a

70
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,530
little while where you could take almost any book and you could point this device at it and it would

71
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,850
read it to you. Uh, now they have stuff that's, everything's linked to the internet of things,

72
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,250
you know? So, um, there, there's actually a set of glasses too, that exists. If you're,

73
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,950
if you have low vision and the set of glasses will sit there and give you an audio description

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,070
of everything in front of you, including familiar things, like for instance, if you were in your

75
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,270
home, Greek, it would specifically facially recognize the wife and, uh, tell you the wife

76
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,830
is in the room. What if you don't want to facially recognize her? But anyway, I'm just saying it's,

77
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,110
uh, take my wife, take my wife, please. I keep taking her places, but she keeps coming back.

78
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,790
Uh, yeah, I know. Any young men, uh, if you ever see a, you see a guy on the internet somewhere

79
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,230
and in the image, a guy holding a violin while he's telling jokes, that's probably him.

80
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,850
Anyways. The other one is Rodney Dangerfield. Like, like my daughter, you know, she's like

81
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,950
federal express. She absolutely positively has to spend the night. There you go. Plus, you know,

82
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,990
my parents, they had to put a pork chop around my neck there. So the dog would play with me.

83
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:12,430
Oh, I get no respect. Yeah. Anyways. So Chuck, let's move on. Sure. Look, I'm not trying to just

84
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,030
carry on. Cause the optical stuff is not getting me bored, but it is optical stuff, right? So let's

85
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,350
jump into some chili in the Greek. Exactly. Let's do that. Now. Uh, there was a bunch of talk in the

86
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,430
chat room and I want to address it about the, uh, you know, the Adam and which Adam is which,

87
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,950
cause we talk about how there is more than one Adam. Although, uh, in religious circles,

88
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,070
they discuss one Adam being, you know, the first guy that supposedly has his rib taken out.

89
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:46,070
It's simple, simple. There's never just one. It's a, it's a survivor race that's been genetically

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:55,990
modified. It's pretty clear. Uh, even if you have someone that survived a cataclysm and they're part

91
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,210
of the original, you could call them part of the original creation. Right. Right. So if I've got a

92
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,350
59, a Chevy that's untouched and perfect condition with 20,000 miles on it outside, I could say

93
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:16,170
that's what it is, right? Even though it's 70 years later, plus so or less. So, um, it's an

94
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:22,250
original aspect versus, uh, uh, something newer and newer and newer, by the way, the, the latest,

95
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:29,870
uh, generation spoken of in these ancient texts are spoken of as if they're, um, not even connected

96
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,650
to the original humans. Go, go figure. If you actually look at the, a lot of the original words,

97
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,810
they're very rare. There's no reference to the last generation of people known as referred to

98
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,910
any relationship to Adam and all those that they're just called the last generation of people.

99
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,530
So by, yeah, but by, by the meaning of the word generation though, it means that they were

100
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,930
generated from something previous. No, no, no generation just means flipping, you know,

101
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,190
reproduction. Okay. Okay. Like a Xerox machine, but it's not really like a Xerox machine,

102
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,030
but that, that story here, that's a, that's a very interesting story because

103
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,250
here, these are the, there's some serious doubts in there. You know, I recently did an

104
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,950
interview with Greg Carlwood again and, um, higher side check. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And he, he's,

105
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,950
uh, he says he's, he likes it because it's a timeless interview. He may not post it immediately.

106
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,930
He could post it. It's not like the news about the fires in Maui. Right. Right. So, uh, which

107
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,250
will be strange if you post it out of content, out of time. So anyway, uh, there's a lot of stuff,

108
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,850
a lot of weaknesses in there. The reason why I pursued it is because I want to know what to do.

109
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,110
If I go somewhere and I don't know what the F is going on, somebody tell me what to do, please.

110
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:45,250
Right. Or do I have to, I don't have enough time to make things up as I go. Right. And, um, uh,

111
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,110
that's where experience comes in. You know, as you get older, you relate to younger people, you,

112
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,450
you, you relay some information or knowledge that you have, so they don't have to reinvent it,

113
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,610
right. Find out how things work. Not only that, but it would be a good idea to have a good go-to

114
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,910
plan considering that if, if the fire was moving at approximately one mile per minute, which

115
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,370
translates to about 60 miles per hour, if that is the way that it appears to be traveling across

116
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:17,150
the land, that's a fairly fast moving event, which you need to have some idea about what to do about.

117
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,890
You can't be stopping and going, okay, now what is it we need to assess here? You don't have time.

118
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,830
Life is very fast moving event. I mean, uh, look at the trees. If you go back to where you were

119
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:33,370
raised and there were large trees, they're still there unchanged pretty much. Right. And, uh, that's,

120
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,230
that's what I've noticed. So anyway, the doubts that I have is not necessarily a doubt. It's just

121
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,510
that you could play blatantly. See, like for example, Yahweh, when they did the generations

122
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,630
and Moses, these guys put it together, they obviously didn't know about the people living

123
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,070
in the South Congo, obviously. And they didn't know about the people living in North Asia

124
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,370
or in the Americas. Obviously they're not mentioned in there. Why? Because they didn't

125
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,050
know about them. Right. Think about it. What I just said, if, well, if he's the God and the

126
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,570
creator of everything, shouldn't he know about that? But obviously he didn't know whoever put

127
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,430
that text together. So what does that tell you? So these weak points, there's a lot, here's the

128
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,170
thing. There's a lot of people that bring up contradictions in the Bible and it's only

129
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,250
lost in translation or version is not really a contradiction. If you see it, just like when you

130
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,290
say there's no crucifixion, that sounds like a contradiction just because they put the word

131
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,890
crucifixion in 50 times doesn't mean it happened. Right. Like terrorism for 9-11. There was no

132
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,290
terrorism. It was sabotage. In other words, they set off things that should not have been set off

133
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,830
without public notice. So, right. By the way, a little diversion, we'll go back to it.

134
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,590
There are more people, civilians, Americans that died in World War Two in the U.S. via sabotage

135
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,690
than attacks. And there was Torpedo Alley. You don't hear about that. Well, 5,000 people died

136
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,170
on the Carolinas, on the East Coast. You don't hear anything about that.

137
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:04,850
But there's thousands and thousands upon scores of thousands that died on sabotage, factory fires,

138
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,450
accidents, things like that. Just like right now, I think there's a factory fire, like 10 a month

139
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,130
at a rate of 10 a month, either food processing or chemical processing plants in the U.S. going off,

140
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,850
right, on fire. Right. So they're just repeating the same old playbook. So, in other words,

141
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,430
there are things going on that are blatant. And even if you're living in that time you don't know

142
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,390
about, the people that search a little record it. And then they see that those things happened

143
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,230
before. So if you want to talk about scripture here, this is my main concern. It's basically

144
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,290
prophecy, like knowing what's coming, because, hey, anybody who works on Wall Street wants to

145
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,270
know that. Right. You had to hedge your bets. Where did you say the world is ending? Is it

146
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,610
if it's really not ending, why are you going to get so hyped up about it? Right. So you

147
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,110
live more efficiently. The other thing is, how do you live? Right. I mean, I don't know. I mean,

148
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,070
what do you remember? We went last time we spoke about, like, if you listen to the scientists or

149
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,450
watch TV, they'll tell you to eat one thing and then it's bad the next year. And then he said,

150
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,730
no, I don't go by that. Right. You know, there's no mention of the heart being a pump, which is

151
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,650
true. Right. In the Bible, there's no mention of an immune system, which is there's no such thing.

152
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,670
Right. So you just basically see a set of rules that are tried and tested. And that's why I do

153
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,230
it in terms of prophecy. And I'll throw this in. I can't discuss anymore.

154
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,630
When looking at archaics of stuff, I don't endorse them because

155
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,390
just like I don't endorse anyone, really. You go look at the comments section. I'm not

156
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,910
disparaging either. This is just planet Earth. If you go look at all the people that are following

157
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:38,150
him. Oh, my gosh. Oh, you do not want. Oh, my gosh. It's like talk about anyway. You look at

158
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,830
anybody's comment section. Yeah. Oh, my God. It's like, please, if we ever doing a no comments,

159
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,350
the chat is seems to be fine because we do have a cream of the crop. It seems that come over to

160
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,530
this section of the world known as Grocelli in the Greek rated why the uncultivated humanity.

161
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,390
But what I'm looking at is this timeline. I think he's overstated a lot of it, but there is a lot

162
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,530
of validity there. Right. That's all I want to say. And I'm looking at it very closely.

163
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,670
But the thing on the thing on the 1998, which I've been doing strictly from the Bible

164
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,190
is endorsed by him and Edgar Cayce. I didn't know Edgar Cayce had said that.

165
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,910
I always thought Edgar Cayce was too airy, fairy, happy, clappy, even though he was called a sleeping

166
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,030
prophet. I didn't give him any credence. Well, that may be because of the way people tell the

167
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,850
story, because let me just throw this in real fast. You talked about how people didn't know

168
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,710
certain things. You know, they didn't know about the people in the Americas and whatnot at the

169
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,890
time they wrote that. Well, the authors of the of the operations in Genesis. Yeah, right. So they

170
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,190
don't know about that. That's fine. But here's the other thing. No matter what they knew,

171
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,670
they can only relate a part of what it is they know anyway, even if,

172
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,570
OK, let's just theoretically say, you mean they ran out of ink and paper? No,

173
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,950
they didn't run out of ink and paper. You don't have to run out of ink and paper. Here's the

174
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,470
thing. You got to be selective. You can't tell everybody about every single blade of grass.

175
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,450
Well, hold on. That's why I lean into it only. It's only in regard to that part of the world.

176
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,150
That's why I've said that before as a caveat. But when it says these are all the generations of

177
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,990
Adam, well, we left out the people of southern Congo and we've left out the people in the

178
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,670
Dakotas and we've left out. Right. The Inuits, we left out. Yeah. Right. So obviously, because

179
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,510
they didn't know about them. So what kind of a creator of everything would not know? You see,

180
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,110
there's a problem, big problem there. But it doesn't matter. Well, not necessarily relation

181
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,370
that works. But you see, it may work just fine, though, because it's not necessarily about what

182
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,430
they don't know. It's maybe that's not the same people. How about that? No, no, no. I didn't say

183
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,570
they don't know for sure, but apparently it appears what they're giving. There's a lot being,

184
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,230
you know, you know, the intelligence operatives, you know, the rules of questioning people. I think

185
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,510
we went over that before. Right. Listen to what they say. Listen to what they don't say.

186
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,750
Listen, how look at how they say what they say and look at how they don't say what they don't say.

187
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,430
Right. So, well, look, when you seek to instruct somebody, whether it's about a simplified,

188
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,310
you know, series of tasks that they need to learn how to do, like, say, in job training

189
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,970
or something like that, or it is to literally give them a philosophy by which to live,

190
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,490
you're going to be selective about what it is you give them. The first things you need to

191
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,390
are the essentials. Right. I mean, this is operationally what you need. All right. Now,

192
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,350
these are the things that may come up. OK. And you put these things in order. I mean,

193
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,770
anybody. Well, let's just get just to make it really clear. It's like the U.S. Constitution.

194
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,030
Why is it called the U.S. Constitution? Because it's for the U.S. But in the U.S. Constitution,

195
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,990
though, doesn't it state that the operation of this document will be the law of nations?

196
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,130
What's the law of nations? It's all international. So it goes back and forth.

197
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,630
So, yeah, but the Adam look, this is what I've the last time we spoke about

198
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,350
the spirit. I think I gave a heavy analogy and I don't know how to beat people over the head with

199
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,370
it. But in terms of being spiritual, anything that is cognitive, behavioral, expressive,

200
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,230
communicative, anything and everything is spiritual. Right. The only thing that is not is a

201
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,590
bunch of people laying down in bed sleeping or in a coma. Right. So the moment they start uttering

202
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,990
a groaning, guess what? That is a spiritual emanation. Right. And it's spiritual is both

203
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,510
bad and good and in between. So when you look at these things, you have to see, is it a data point?

204
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,830
Is it some base, a knowledge base? Right. Or is it spiritual? And I would tell you that 99

205
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,090
percent of the Bible is not spiritual at all. It's all data points and knowledge base.

206
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,730
Right. That's why I say religions have nothing to do with the text that they're written on. Right.

207
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,650
So, yeah. So the thing is, going back to people, why I don't get bored is very simple.

208
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,450
Even though I live here the entire life in total disgust when I see people around me,

209
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,370
pretty much everyone to it with very few exceptions, instead of getting bored when

210
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,870
I'm not feeling that or thinking that it's what am I going to do to get the F out of here?

211
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:05,010
Or gracefully for personally gracefully leave this situation. Right. So what happens is you move

212
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,150
like out of one room to another and or into the street into another building into another country.

213
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,010
And you start noticing that it's pretty much the same everywhere. You remind yourself of that

214
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,349
thought that you need an exit strategy. So instead of being bored of what's in front of you, which I

215
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:28,710
find utterly repugnant in terms of the behavior of people, I find that pondering an exit is

216
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:35,310
the next best thing. The better than being bored. That's why I'm never bored.

217
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,290
If that makes any sense. You see, boredom is a form of anger, by the way. I've always

218
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,690
suggested that. And there was a psychologist I spoke to says, well, that's very interesting,

219
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,250
Greek. And I can't really write that up for you. Can't really publish that because you're not a

220
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:58,170
psychologist. Like, oh, my gosh. But, you know, if I publish it, you know, then then people will

221
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:03,170
listen to it. I'm like, oh, if you, you know, so. Yeah. Well, you know what you can do always is

222
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,130
you could turn around and write to like a publication like Psychology Today and positive

223
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,470
under a false name. And they will publish it sometimes, some odd things like that and create

224
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,070
discussions. Yeah. You do that. Let me know what happens. Yeah. You have a license to do that.

225
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:23,470
I thank you anyway. But I'm not suggesting you do that. That's probably not an efficient use of your

226
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,570
time. But I will say that people also brought up a couple of things that were brought up on previous

227
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,530
sonic incarnations of this where you mentioned specifically twenty twenty nine and a couple of

228
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,030
other time periods. And what does this get us into? Well, the favorite topic when you and I were

229
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:47,350
discussing this on AFR seemed to be the what was referred to as the kill shot, which was the you

230
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,370
know, the thing that's going to happen here, the beginning to reorganize that. But I never really

231
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,370
got into twenty twenty nine as much as I did twenty eighteen plus seven plus seven. You see,

232
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,230
so twenty eighteen plus seven twenty twenty five and then plus seven is twenty thirty two. That's

233
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,530
what I would suggest. The kill shot would be twenty thirty two. So I never really did.

234
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,630
As far as I can remember for three decades, that's all three, three decades ago. I really,

235
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,430
really try to figure this out. What I mean by three decades ago, around 2003, 2006. Right.

236
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:24,290
So the tens, the ones two thousands is one decade. The tens is second decade. Now we're in the 20s.

237
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,070
That's the third decade. Right. Right. You know, it's funny, you know, how people you know,

238
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,390
when you're born, you're in your first decade. Right. The day you're born, you're in your first

239
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,330
decade, you're in your first millennium, your first century, you're in the very early part,

240
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,190
you're in your first year, but you're only an hour old. Right. So there's a difference between.

241
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,030
Right. Even if it's one hour in, you're still in. So you're still in your first year. Right.

242
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,470
You're still in your first decade. Right. See, however you want to. It's basically a metric.

243
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,530
So for three decades, I've been trying to put this together. And I did pretty good work,

244
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,010
I think, for those three years between what they call three and six. And then I sat on it

245
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,450
and looked at other things and I didn't see any reason to change it. Now, the archaics has got

246
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,770
the Phoenix chronology and these other chronologies. I'm trying to see how valid that is. And is it

247
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,330
valid? And does it work? But right now, as far as I know, if I were to communicate anything,

248
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,890
the last time period change was around 2018. Remember, it's the middle of the time period,

249
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:26,130
right? So four years plus 2018 is 2022. And the three years actually, there's a year break that

250
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:36,270
so 2020, 2021 defined 2022. Right. And then we got 2025 is the next period. And then 2032.

251
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,710
Right. I don't talk much about the twenty nines or the twenty twenties or twenty threes. You see,

252
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:47,810
you see how I parsed it out? Yeah. So what I've always said, and I'm still sticking with it,

253
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:52,230
is you're going to see the formation of a Middle East Union by 2025.

254
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,250
As far as I could see, meaning but it's a loose union. It's not like the EU where they have one

255
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,090
month. They're all going to kind of gang up and work together and Israel is going to be

256
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,350
kicked in the ass pretty good. But it's not because they could kick Israel in the ass.

257
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,110
It's because the leadership of Israel has got to abandon it. Right. Because that's going to change.

258
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,710
So well, just perfect timing from this part of the world, because honestly, look, we got our

259
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,170
twenty twenty four selection process coming up and then allegedly a new administration will be

260
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:26,090
taking hold in 2025, which they usually try to make some sort of a mark when it comes to the

261
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,510
Middle East. That could be something that affects those events and empowers some individuals that

262
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,850
might have not been empowered before, which is what I suspect. OK, you're putting it in view,

263
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,050
but I just want to I got to digress and go back. Sure. What I just said about 2025 in the Middle

264
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,930
East Union, I was saying in 2003. So it's not like I'm watching what's going on. You see,

265
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,550
it's just interesting when you watch what's going on. Remember, there was a big thing in Turkey,

266
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,050
like a little civil war and there was Arab Spring and people were saying, Greek, is this your

267
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,650
Middle East Union? I'm like, no, it's not time yet. And that was 12 years ago. Right. Just like

268
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,430
about a year or a year and a half ago, something like that. I asked you about this, you know,

269
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,810
things that were going on in Israel regarding the courts and the change. And it's a nothing burger

270
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,650
and it turned out to be a nothing burger. That's exactly where it went. But do I have it? Do I have

271
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,510
a knack for it? Apparently, it seems like I do. Does it matter to me if I'm wrong or if I'm right?

272
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,770
No. What am I talking about? Stuff that no one else is talking about in a way that's easy to

273
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,570
comprehend. Well, you'll have to answer that yourself. But I think I do. So what else is in

274
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,110
the chat? Well, I mean, there was that there was a little bit of an address to the the water topic

275
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,030
because you would put an image in there for a moment. Yeah, it's not fun that that that is fun.

276
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,970
I like that one piece. And by the way, I don't know if you understood this because I sent you

277
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:55,390
a text earlier. I just like that from an aesthetic perspective. Wow. It's like a wow. Wow. Wow. Kind

278
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,390
of like, oh, wow. Eye candy. Well, that would be cool as a cloth pattern. I mean, I'm just looking

279
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,090
at it that way. You know what I mean? Like I just shot that, you know, I just put the device

280
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:13,650
strung across some struts in front of a 430 a 40 inch plasma TV, LED TV. Yeah. And just

281
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,470
flash through some images. That's all I was just playing around because I've got to do some

282
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,450
photo documentation stuff. This is all industrial. These things are for lease and they're for sale.

283
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,950
They're very expensive. Don't ask if you want one, if you want one, just prepare it. It's

284
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,710
very, very pricey because it's expensive to make. It's very elitist.

285
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,490
And yeah, yeah, listen, the last thing the last thing I want is people want 100 people

286
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,710
wanting one of these that I really have to exit this world. There's no way you can make these

287
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,390
things fast. They're there. They're there. They work on subtle, subtle energy that is extremely

288
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,870
strong. You know that you talk about subtle energies, right? Most subtle energy devices

289
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:03,550
are very weak, right? This is a subtle energy device is extremely strong. So on a transformational

290
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,950
basis, so it's requires before we were even speaking, I was like, I need to find other

291
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,190
people step up to the plate and work with me on this. I can't be the only one that could advance

292
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,950
this, right? So if you're listening, and you're into, you know about the ether, you know about

293
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,470
magnetism, even though this doesn't use magnetism, even though there's a presence of a magnet,

294
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,150
and how to manipulate water, get in touch with the Greek, please, I could use some help,

295
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,490
an associate, an associate, let's just say, right, look, mathematically, Greek, I would say that

296
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,810
there stands to reason that there is a group of people that could be, you know, could work.

297
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,890
That's right. Let me just say what you what you would before you go on on the surface world,

298
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,510
vanilla, the white world, I know that in the black world, it's going on pretty hard.

299
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,590
It has been going on, they're probably laughing at that. I've come up with this. Yeah, I'm talking

300
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,870
about the surface world. Yeah, in the black world, who knows, right? Yeah, well, look, I don't claim

301
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,790
to know. But I'm just saying that on the surface world, I guarantee that there are a handful of

302
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,970
people that you could access, that would be at least up to par to be able to work with me that

303
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,310
guarantee in writing, I need it, please. If you want it written down, I'll write it down to you and

304
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:24,310
you know, what else? What else? What else we got? Well, look, there's there's a lot of things we

305
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:30,410
could go into. Let's go back to those Mount Maui fires real quick, though. Because what about Hold

306
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,410
on, I know nothing about them. I saw a headline about two weeks ago, and then it was brought up

307
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,030
by grit call. What I know absolutely is it the claiming claiming do weapons, the let me guess,

308
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,450
the authorities knew that for knowledge, they didn't warn the people I'm guessing. And there

309
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,570
is a conspiracy, whatever. Yeah. And it was for thought, right? I'm guessing correctly.

310
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,050
Oh, listen, you you're you're playing the game that I played the moment I saw the headline and

311
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,270
decided, okay, before I open up Twitter, I'm going to see what it is I know is going to already be up

312
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:05,490
there. Exactly, exactly that. And it was real quick. It was actually a lot faster than usual,

313
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:12,630
the the divergence of oddity there regarding the you know, the the the direct energy weapons and

314
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,790
everything else. But at the end of the day, you know what you live on a volcano, first of all.

315
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,390
And secondly, yeah, land management, electrical stuff, this is going to happen.

316
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,210
Why did it move so fast might have something to do with the fact that there was a hurricane

317
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,610
off the coast of the island chain, which changes the wind conditions a bit if it's a little further

318
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:39,530
away, even though it's not on top. Yeah, good lines up with the sabotage of 1940s. And which

319
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,810
was all internal, by the way, and they blamed it on German spies. No, yeah. But there was some

320
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,630
interesting stuff that went on there. You know, I was restudying that recently, you know, that

321
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,670
when they took down the the German boom, for instance, you know, for instance, and the FBI

322
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,690
becoming involved in that, and actually, that was the first time that the mob was actually weaponized

323
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,970
by the feds. Because that's what I was looking to study on is, you know, they they actually used

324
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,750
some organized crime guys who did not want to prop up the what they would call American Nazis.

325
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,890
So they turned one group against the other until they decided to turn against the mob, you know,

326
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,910
later, just like they used them to try to take out Castro, you know?

327
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,810
Well, here's a sentiment that I got from people that live during the era and also very little,

328
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:28,990
very little literal support. But the American Nazis, the German Nazis, whatever,

329
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,930
they all had a lot of sympathy for the US. And just without getting into what I mean by that is

330
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,590
that ultimately, they looked at the US as a safe haven. They had no intention of coming over here

331
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,310
and doing whatever they did. They had a big propaganda campaign to cause harm here. But the

332
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,850
people didn't even the troops did not go for it. They could have easily harmed the United States,

333
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,950
they had the weaponry and the technology they were doing. Halo, they were doing suborbital

334
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,730
flights, they had pressurized planes with rockets, they could go around the earth five times in a

335
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,310
day. And, you know, five, you know, they're approaching 20,000 miles per hour, dropping

336
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:13,190
nukes on in northern Russia. So the Yeah, they were super advanced compared to look, some of the

337
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,150
if you were brought forward the designs and capabilities of some of the quote unquote,

338
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,830
German weapons at the time, they would sound like fiction even today. Right? Yeah. So no,

339
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,410
they viewed the US as a safe haven kind of a place to go when things to cool off. And if things

340
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:35,010
didn't cool down. Yeah, it was all internal. It was the same people look right now. One thing that

341
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,190
I bring up with, you know, every country has a foreign government, which is united in its own

342
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:46,010
foreignness. And look at all when you when you're a federal employee, you're actually an unregistered

343
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:52,970
foreign agent. This is the norm. And then it's no big deal. Just like when they asked JP Morgan,

344
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,790
what are you going to do when people find out how the money system works? So it's easy. I'll just

345
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,290
draft enough checks to pay half the people to kill the other half of the people. Right? So the whole

346
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:08,030
thing about any quote unquote, foreign government is to get as many people on their payroll as

347
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,270
possible, because they're the ones most likely that are not going to rebel. I always give the

348
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,830
opposite. If you want to change the system, you have to join them and infiltrate and go up as high

349
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:22,470
as possible. And when no one's looking, you pull all the wires out, right? Oh, yeah. But

350
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,690
like that, yeah, to satisfy the people, though, that insist on being outsiders,

351
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,570
what you do is you assign them a job where they appear to be outsiders, and then you pit them

352
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,650
against each other so that they appear to have causes. This is what I'm talking about with the

353
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,350
mob versus the American Nazis. I mean, because look publicly before the beginning of World War Two,

354
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,770
officially or otherwise, you have these things like that gathering in Madison Square Garden,

355
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,930
I'm sure you've seen the film of it, right? Yeah, I mean, it's just an interesting thing to behold,

356
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,530
considering that, you know, they weren't allowed to display any swastikas or whatever. But otherwise,

357
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,590
you've got the template already for what you're going to see come out of Germany.

358
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,710
And about 10 years later, they were out in Long Island, they had an enclave in Long Island. It

359
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:11,470
wasn't. It was not hoppock. It was anyway, Nazi enclave, Hitler Road and all that.

360
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,950
They had a great one in Jersey, actually, one where, you know, they bought a big piece of

361
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,530
farmland pretty much and then started developing it for themselves. There was another one in

362
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,070
California. You know about the big one in California, right? That was started by the

363
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,290
guy who was like a screenwriter. And he was like, you know, pissed off at the people that

364
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,330
were actually paying him and he was making a good living. Good enough to Jewish bankers, too.

365
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,650
Of course. Yeah. But that was the fascinating part of it. And then what did they do? They

366
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,970
went to people like, you know, Meyer Lansky and those guys and said, hey, you want to help us

367
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,030
fight this? And they said, sure, of course they did. But this was just to keep people busy.

368
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,430
I mean, that's really what it was about. But I just find it interesting when law enforcement

369
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:55,010
pits to groups of individuals that they're supposedly allegedly supposed to be in total

370
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,310
opposition to and looking to bust, break down, take down. They pit them against each other,

371
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,930
you know, much like what I find most interesting about law enforcement is they know nothing about

372
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,370
law. Well, that's the beginning of doctors on it. Right. You see what I mean? There's a very

373
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,590
interesting twist. That's why I can't be bored. I'm always thinking, how do I get the fuck out

374
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,590
of here? Oh, there's that medical term again. What else is going on? Look, everybody's got

375
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,470
up. Everybody's got an exit. Yes, everybody's got an exit. But you know what? The strategy

376
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,570
is different because your exits come in whether you want it to or not. I mean,

377
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,530
nobody here gets out alive. OK, that's just the way it is. But yeah, that's

378
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,070
the way you leave is is up to you, isn't it? So in the meantime, do the best you can and help

379
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,670
others as much as you can. I believe in that as well. As strange as that sounds, because

380
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,790
we've got to do more than believe to actually do it. Yeah, I'm not saying you don't. I'm just

381
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,950
saying that's the credo that most people say these things that they don't. Yeah, when I say I

382
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,070
believe when I say I believe I got to tell you something, I imply something else. Maybe you can

383
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,250
give me a different vocabulary word for this, actually, because when I say I believe in something,

384
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,830
I don't just say I have the thought and it's something that I think is true. I need to say

385
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:11,330
that it is something that I also do. I actively participate in because I believe this. You see,

386
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:17,570
belief for me goes beyond just the common idea of I believe it goes into. If you don't believe

387
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,730
in something or if you do believe in something, there's no way in hell that you don't take action

388
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,810
that goes along with said belief. OK, I mean, I beg to differ. A lot of the religious leaders

389
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,910
say they believe in their raping children all the time. Yes. So which one is it? See,

390
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,350
I'm talking about me. I'm not talking about them. OK, I don't know. But yeah,

391
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:41,350
but I have to bring it over to a common premise. Of course. Of course. Yeah. So in other words,

392
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,670
that's why I'm asking you for a new word, because. Well, it's just a word selection.

393
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,090
You don't need a new word. Just figure out a different way to say it. And look,

394
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:55,450
Greek speak is full of it, you know? Yeah. Well, full of what? Full of it. Full of terms of them,

395
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,430
full of terms that are unique but easy to compile. Fair enough. Dummy load and, you know,

396
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,010
goes on and on and on. Heat space heaters and all that. Absolutely. So back to the back to

397
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,910
the fires, though, it does make me think not of just the fires in the particulars, because again,

398
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,290
like you said, you don't know the particulars right this minute, but you can guess very easily

399
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,330
where it was all going. That's why it's stage stage play, whatever. Here's the thing, though.

400
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:24,270
You used to talk about the the the kill shot, which I took to mean some sort of meteor. And

401
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,930
I was thinking of the cataclysm that was upon people as they, you know, look from the perspective

402
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,470
of somebody who was just sitting in their home one day and then all of a sudden all hell broke

403
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:38,450
loose, so to speak. Right. Yeah. But there's two of those. And as far as I could determine,

404
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,650
and one of them is of manufacture. I mean, in other words, it's not a lumpy rock, right?

405
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:50,010
With craters on it. OK. All right. We discussed that. Yeah. Right. So one more artificial

406
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:56,490
invention. Yeah. Well, art of manufacture. Yeah. Man, you look like you're not going to get a

407
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,010
picture of the second one. I'll strike fear in the hearts of the week. Right.

408
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,310
Well, why is that thing a disc? It's a mile wide with a hole in the middle of it. That's

409
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,510
500 feet thick. Wow. So it's polished and smooth. Perfect. Well, I always wondered,

410
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:16,010
does it even require the physical meteor or projectile landing on the planet if you just

411
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:23,630
simply have the the installation of fear upon the population? If you do that, if you convince the

412
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,250
population that this thing is going to hit, even take a look at what will happen, I'm thinking

413
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,050
without even the fact that it'll happen, they'll just think that if they put brown paper bags on

414
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,489
their heads and lay down, everything's going to be fine. Yikes. So we're going to make this guy.

415
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,530
Yeah, we're doing don't forget about the people. Yeah. OK. When you say people, there's there's

416
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,250
not that many on the planet, no matter what they say. The number of count is is very few always.

417
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,790
Well, that's actually they will be fine. Well, and you know what? Even if they're

418
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,850
killed instantly, they'll still be fine because they weren't really alive to begin with.

419
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,430
Yeah, I don't like that word. I'd like to come up with another word for I never actually

420
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:09,210
ever noticed. I don't use that word. Yeah, I care about. Yeah. It's because it has a connotation

421
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,330
that it has an effect on the mind, you know, that the one who utters it

422
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,770
is subject to it or capable of that. Right. We're not capable. But, you know,

423
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,010
whatever. You know what I mean? It's it's not a quote unquote.

424
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,510
No, it carries it carries extra sentimentality to it for a four letter word. It carries a lot

425
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,030
of extra sentimentality to it. That is kind of remarkable, because when you say kill,

426
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,910
obviously there's an ominous already a negativity attached to it just by saying that word.

427
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,370
That's why I always hate. I remember there are some places called the kills, but it's from Dutch

428
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,570
fresh kills. Gosh, what a horrible name. Fresh kills. Yeah, I always thought of that. What do

429
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,670
you mean? Are you talking about a fresh corpse? I mean, what does this mean? That's the place

430
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,970
also where they dumped all the radioactive stuff from the WTC. OK, what else? So it looks like

431
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,350
there was a lot of stuff before and after I put some things in there or not really. Right.

432
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,170
Well, there was this one big bombing of stuff about, you know, the atom, the generations.

433
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,890
We addressed that. But again, back to this, back to this meteor or whatever it is that strikes.

434
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,210
Yeah. Do you still stand by that calculation? Is that still the same?

435
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,970
Unknown. But yes, I do. But unknown. I'm trying to see if there's more stuff I can glean from

436
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,590
Jason Breshears at Archaic's work and see if it works together. Otherwise,

437
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,230
I am not ready to make any discourse on it.

438
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,350
So you have some ideas, but you don't think that you have any sort of other confirmation

439
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,590
from somebody who can observe this also on some level?

440
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,950
No, we're not. We're not going to get it. I've met people that work at the Lucifer Telescope

441
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,330
here. Yes, it's called Lucifer. Yes. Mount Graham. Right. And they're just dumber than

442
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,850
rocks. I mean, and it's like it's the guy, the manager, by the way. You know, I'm like,

443
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,210
oh, my gosh. And sorry if you're listening, you know, whatever. Yeah, you're not that smart.

444
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:07,750
Actually, I found out that long time ago that all of these big, quote, unquote, pseudo government,

445
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:13,770
corporate jobs are forms of welfare, they just need to fill a position. And all this hardware

446
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,930
that they show and all these offices are just like dressing. There's everything that's real,

447
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,890
that's controlling is not on the surface, right? Well, you know, like, I remember someone who's a

448
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,510
whole family worked on the State Department. I said, Oh, what a bunch of morons. And they're like,

449
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,570
really quiet. And they're like, so are they moronic? I'm not trying to see if you have a

450
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,750
better word, is it? Yeah, they're pretty moronic. I'm like, thank you. Because I just got to gather

451
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:41,870
I got to do data gathering. You know what I mean? Oh, I got you. It's fairly fascinating. Because,

452
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,290
you know, when I spoke to people that were, you know, involved in things in the what they called

453
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,050
the Soviet bloc, they would tell me about a lot of these positions that were sort of given to people

454
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,810
that had no, no, no good rhyme or reason to be in a position of power at all. And it just boiled

455
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,870
down to they had a nice office and a paycheck. And they didn't really do anything because they

456
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:09,390
didn't know how they were just given. It's a movie set. Yeah, just like a movie set. So when it when

457
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,270
they blow up a movie set, how much sympathy or do you clap? You know, I mean, do you really care?

458
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,150
No, you don't. You just build another one. You just build another one and you put on another

459
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,050
movie, right? I mean, but that's the thing is that these guys were just waiting there for something

460
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,290
to come up. And then yeah, they would be filmed or they'd be handed a statement to read. And they

461
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,450
would put it out on radio or what have you. And that was their actual purpose is to just fill a

462
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,610
role when it came time to fill the role. But otherwise, they did virtually nothing. And that

463
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,690
happened a lot. And I said, Well, is this a function of their state? Or is this just a function

464
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:45,450
of the state? In general? You know, is this just normal? So the thing is, I suggest people do

465
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,270
constant probing. Like the other day, I was out at a hardware store, I struck up a conversation,

466
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,250
it turns out they worked at the university here at Tucson, teaching biology and medicine. And I

467
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,890
just gave him a little bit of Greek speak about that. And they're like, I don't know, man,

468
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,850
that sounds pretty interesting. Like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, another moron. And so they're all

469
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:08,770
morons, all of them. And you know how I've said with attorneys, doctors, lawyers, attorneys,

470
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:14,190
whatever, what these people are all morons, and until they figure out what they should be doing,

471
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,370
and then they don't last very long, they look for an exit strategy to leave or they stay in it and

472
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:25,510
just fleece the people. Yeah. Well, you know, look, how can you really blame somebody who says,

473
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,210
Well, I've got a job here. And I really at the end of the day, even though they tell me I do a

474
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,110
lot of different things, I don't actually do much. And I'm still going to get paid the same either

475
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,890
way. Well, they're not really Yeah, they're getting private credit. Yeah, the thing that I

476
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,470
bring that I keep bringing this up, it doesn't seem to hit home with too many. When you go and

477
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:47,230
file an application with a corporation that has a cage code or a government or whatever cages,

478
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,630
corporate and government entities. I like the terms that they use, like saw, you know,

479
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,190
the patent office, right? You have something usually call it the saw, which is special application

480
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:02,870
withdrawal system, you know, they put your thing to the saw, right? So anyway, these job fairs with

481
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,430
these companies with cage codes, they have hundreds of these youngsters sign up and fill out these

482
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,870
applications and hand them in. Yeah, I told someone, when they went to one about 10 years ago,

483
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:17,510
do the application, but don't sign it. Watch what happens. He got followed by three people,

484
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,370
please sign this is no, no, no, I don't feel excited. Please sign it. The moment you sign

485
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:27,030
your signature, they create the amount of salary off your signature. They have no money to pay

486
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,570
anyone. It's all drawn off your own signature. And then they tell you he's got a tax report,

487
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:38,810
of course, because you're using private, you're endorsing private credit or, or, or, or, or all

488
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:45,950
the other BS. It's so simple. It's so simple. So the real kill shot, the ethical moral kill shot

489
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,550
was the money system that was done almost 100 years ago. I see, right. And you're still hanging

490
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,550
around. So which begs the question, when the physical kill shots that you mentioned, maybe

491
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:00,730
strike fear in them, you don't need the media, right, right? Right. Yeah. So it's going to be

492
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:07,910
a combination of both, you see. So you figure that a significant quote, what they would call

493
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:14,410
a monetary collapse or a system collapse, we'll see it immediately. But I mean, a more dramatic

494
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,290
one way to call the money is monopoly money, right? Yeah. Why did Okay, let's briefly discuss

495
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,330
the history of the game monopoly was quote unquote, depression, that people needed to fantasize

496
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,670
with playing a money game, and they use monopoly money, right? That's where you're in right now,

497
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,970
you're in a game that already collapsed. And in other words, there was a perceived economic

498
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:39,410
collapse in the 30s. So they came up with an op monopoly to keep the people going in a certain

499
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:45,130
game fashion. And that's actually the real thing. Right now you're in a game, it already collapsed,

500
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,070
can collapse a collapse. Can you was that kind of an oxymoron? Well, no, you get pregnant after

501
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:54,030
you've been pregnant, can you get killed twice? Well, not all you have to be brought back to

502
00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:00,990
life. Yeah, but not only look, once you have a monopoly game going, right? Look, you already

503
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,970
begin with the premise that the bank owned everything, and then you're given an amount

504
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,910
from the bank, you're given that just to start, everybody gets the same hit this home,

505
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,010
bank doesn't own it, what they have is a higher interest than you. And they could tell you what

506
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,710
to do because they have a higher interest. Oh, hi, no pun intended. higher interest,

507
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,970
meaning a higher place, right? And they consider you whatever they want to consider you a debtor,

508
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:30,410
a debtor, a tenant, whatever a surface slave, a subject, whatever. Basically, years ago,

509
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:35,010
there was someone that went in over traffic and driver's license issue. He said this prosecutor

510
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,070
is trying to enslave me. And the judge agreed with him. Yeah, he's trying to enslave you and

511
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,030
prosecute said, Yeah, I'm gonna enslave you. What are you gonna do about it? Everybody's

512
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,270
ganging up on Yeah, we're making you a slave. So what this is in a regular municipal courthouse,

513
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:52,570
right? In Jersey, by the way, okay, so and they don't mind. So this has got to be cleaned up.

514
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:59,190
And it will with the movie style reset kind of wipe out. I got you. Well, that's what I meant

515
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:03,150
by more dramatic. And the thing is, though, when you're playing Monopoly, going back to the

516
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,830
Monopoly idea, yeah, look, it all starts in the box. It all starts in a box, one box, which has

517
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,270
nothing to do with you until you decide to play the game. Then it all does what no matter what

518
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:19,510
goes on during the game, who wins, who loses, who exchanges what, eventually, it all goes back in

519
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:26,630
the box. So, you know, what did you actually do reset when the lights go out, everybody goes to

520
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,470
sleep, and you wake up again. There you go. I mean, speaking of waking up again, I put a little

521
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:37,310
Philip, I was called a dickhead, because I put a Philip K. Dick, which is fine. I get the point

522
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:45,630
about the simulation, the controllers. I just like the way that Philip K. Dick parses out

523
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,610
phrases. That's why I put it in. Absolutely. And that's not a bad way to look at it as well.

524
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:57,310
Because, again, as to who is in control or who created the code, there's your question, maybe.

525
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:03,850
But it appears that there is a code here. OK, there is. Yeah. Go back to the money and God we

526
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,370
trust. It's it's not the God that people hope for to be God. It's the God of this world. Right.

527
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:16,150
So there's a lot being disclosed. Is there a way to show that the economic system is based on the

528
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:23,350
monopoly game being fiat, you know, not real. It's pretty real, though, because imagine a game

529
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:29,290
where it real in terms of physical bodily harm. Aren't weren't there games? I think rollerball

530
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,290
was one of the first one in Death Race 1000 or whatever it was right where they you know,

531
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:38,950
what is it called? Blood sport. Right. Gladiator type stuff. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what you're

532
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:44,390
living in. It's a it's it's it's all a sport. So the game goes to a sport which is a blood sport.

533
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:50,990
If someone cuts your guts out because because of a game. Right. That's what's going on.

534
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:57,550
So, well, and there you go. Look, bottom line. All right. About a lot of this stuff,

535
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:02,270
as far as I'm concerned, is that we need to recognize that, indeed, it is a game,

536
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:07,690
but it does affect people. It's brutal. You did mention earlier something a little back and forth.

537
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,890
I'm just going to mention the one line because I thought it was kind of funny for you to say it.

538
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:17,390
But at the same time, makes sense where, you know, you said something about you can't eat paper.

539
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:24,590
And I said, well, yeah, OK, you're right. But you can't usually exchange it. It has value. Right.

540
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,590
Yeah. So that's the thing about this is that depending on how you decide to proceed

541
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:36,610
and depending on what types of paper you get in your hands or digital representations of

542
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:45,110
things, you know, you can exchange it for some actual real world items. Yeah, sure. Sure. Yep.

543
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:52,010
And the way that I work, it takes a lot of energy to to do that, you know, hassle. So but either

544
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,250
way, it's it's a is it better to have it in this condition that we're in than not have it? I think

545
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:03,230
so. Yeah, it does seem that way. I mean, I'm trying to get a down payment for a car. Yikes.

546
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,870
Don't even get me started on that mess. Well, then if the down payment doesn't work, look for

547
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,010
the up payment. I would love to find the up payment. Matter of fact, I've heard stories

548
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,490
about up payments actually recently, and I'm wondering how true it is. But I don't know.

549
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,970
I'm just playing with words because the whole thing is this just bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

550
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:29,750
Speaking of bizarre. What else have we got? Well, I'm just about tapped out outside of

551
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,850
what else was brought up in chat. I can't even think of anything else outside of, again,

552
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:39,130
the barrage of questions regarding prophecy. I mean, if you want to speak about that again

553
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,510
or clarify over that. Well, what's what's interesting about prophecy, just look at it as

554
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:50,270
history. Right. And if you understand that time is not linear, I was very careful to say that that

555
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:56,430
way. All right. Because the idea of linear time has been challenged, but it's very difficult

556
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:03,050
concept. Right. It's one of the concepts that I brought up was using the fish analogy. You have

557
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:09,850
this crazy fish and he comes around and he tells all the other fish, I think we're all in water.

558
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:16,310
And they look at him like water will show us how we're all in water. You're crazy. Right. But maybe

559
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:22,870
the one of the last thoughts and thoughts a fish has when it dies is that it's in water. Right. So

560
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:28,590
if you're one step ahead of the crowd, you're considered a visionary. If you're two steps,

561
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,970
you're considered insane. And if you're three steps ahead of the crowd, it's Greek speak.

562
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:39,970
You know, just one thing, one last thing about prophecy is I did accidentally stumble across

563
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:46,830
one of those old Nostradamus things. And it's always interesting how they they pretty much

564
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,710
have piled. I don't know how many different people now. This guy is a composite figure,

565
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:57,010
more of a composite than even Shakespeare ever was or any of these other odd characters out there.

566
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,350
Sort of portrayed as. Yeah. Just like you could say the Bible is that way, too. But if you start

567
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:07,470
digging in deep, you'll you'll get a focal point and a nexus point that you could work with.

568
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:12,790
But it's it's it's fascinating to me how people get so alarmed. And so, you know, it's a trigger.

569
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:17,490
It's a triggering mechanism now to talk about. But Nostradamus has kind of fallen out of favor.

570
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:23,150
There's this new guy in South America somewhere who's in his 30s who is being described as a

571
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,610
living Brazilian. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. He brought well, he said that there was going he

572
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:33,730
was on Veritas TV a while back. Someone sent me a link about hemorrhagic fever is the next thing

573
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:40,270
they're going to do the real deal. And it has not appeared. So I think that anytime you predict

574
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,450
something bad, people through history are always going to listen and expect it. And when it doesn't

575
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:51,390
they they're very forgiven, forgiving. So, well, I was going to say that's an interesting thing,

576
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,110
because how many times in history I'm sure you've read some of this stuff where there

577
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,010
have been these doomsday prophets of sorts who have said, look, the world is going to end on

578
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:06,230
this day in 1892 or 1955 or 1985. It doesn't matter. They claim that there is an absolute

579
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:11,750
day on the Pope's work schedule that they know is the last day on Earth. And then what happens?

580
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,830
It doesn't work that way. No, never did. And it never did. No, it never did. And it never does.

581
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,870
And here's the funny part is when you start to read these things long enough, you find that this

582
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,370
guy predicted three, four or five times his church did it three, four or five, six times. Yeah. Well,

583
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:32,810
look, one way to look at it is to relax yourself like the fish. The fish can't tell he's right.

584
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,330
They don't know they're in water. I imagine in my mind, there's another one of me in another world.

585
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:42,870
It's got whatever different situation than here. And I could communicate with him. And there's

586
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:47,110
another world with another me. It's in a different situation. I can communicate with them. Right.

587
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:51,490
On a very subtle level. I mean, that sounds like something they put you in a psych ward for.

588
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,750
But it sounds very much like a dream I had just the other night, by the way. But I actually

589
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,110
felt as though I was actually communicating with myself.

590
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:04,150
But another self. Another self in different circumstances who had gone through things

591
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:09,230
slightly differently. And it was very odd. I don't I don't often have dreams like that,

592
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:14,750
but it was very hard to dream. I was waking up and it was not a dream. And I said, hey,

593
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,350
why am I naked? And there's a mirror here. Let me go look at myself in the mirror. And I was

594
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:26,870
very bronze colored, dark, olive tone, five foot three tall, very Latin looking.

595
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,770
Wow. Kind of right. I was like, oh, my gosh, that doesn't look like me at all. Usually I

596
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,750
look like Johnny Depp when I was younger. I walk in a restaurant and like if there's a table of

597
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:43,690
girls or women, look, it's Johnny Depp. You know, that's what I saw as my appearance was. But

598
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:50,430
anyway, it still is to a degree. So, you know, why did I appear as a five foot something Latin

599
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:56,510
extraction kind of right? And it was like, Oh, what? Okay, different. You don't have to look

600
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:04,110
the same to be the same. Right. So anyway, these are just thought forms that exist. And I do borrow

601
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:09,210
energy from these other worlds, by the way. And I borrow consolence. You know, it's like if I'm

602
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:14,230
having a hard time here, I'm not having a hard time there. It's it's going to be interesting to

603
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,650
find out how much of that is true later on, isn't it? That can console you just to know that it's

604
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,870
not hard elsewhere. Well, it could be when it's hard there. It's not hard here. I think there's

605
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:28,590
a law of opposites sort of they did that in the Marvel Comics a long time ago with the bizarro

606
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:34,570
world or something. Remember? Oh, that was the DC Comics. But yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's all bizarre.

607
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,430
And in the meantime, don't try to make too many friends, but do the right thing as much as

608
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,830
possible. Well, doing the right thing means you got to it sounds sounds to me like you got to

609
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:50,450
give some love now and then to write because that's what that is, after all, which is to the

610
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:56,730
And just in closing, I'd like to say, you know, I really wish that I had been more recognized as

611
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,630
Johnny Depp when I was younger. Instead, I got The Undertaker, even despite the fact that I was

612
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,690
probably six inches shorter than him. I got The Undertaker for some reason. I remember that guy,

613
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:11,050
wrestling guy, long hair, you know, with the beard and sort of, yeah, yeah, sort of look,

614
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:17,690
he looks like The Undertaker guy. Okay. Anyway, and in Jersey, that was actually helpful now and

615
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,530
but not as helpful as Johnny Depp would have been Johnny Depp. Yeah, it was really easy to

616
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,430
get dates that way. Yeah, not the ones that hang on trees. But anyway, yeah,

617
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,230
but there's nothing wrong with those two.
