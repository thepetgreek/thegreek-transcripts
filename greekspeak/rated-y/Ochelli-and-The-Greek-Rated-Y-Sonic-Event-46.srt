1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,540
Sonic Event 46, Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, and here we go. So, I'm just going to get

2
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,240
straight on to the chat stuff, but how are you doing tonight?

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey, alright, 46. I have a bunch of stuff I wanted to relay also since I got a break

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,440
in my mental state from the past, let's say, six months of working on what I'm doing, so...

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,380
Has it been six months? Wow, it hasn't been six months of this? I didn't even realize.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Not this, other stuff, other stuff, too. Yeah, I know, uh, yeah, roughly, um, lawful time? Yeah,

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,820
yeah, definitely. Okay, no, I wasn't aware that it was... I was thinking that that other stuff

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,780
you were doing was only maybe two or three months, but... April. What they call March,

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,520
April. Right, okay. First, the beginning of the year. Yeah, it's stuff I want to relay,

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,140
and as time goes on, I relay more and more. It's, uh, yeah, well, I'll introduce it before

11
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,900
I talk about it. Yeah, you guys will like it. Okay, fair enough. So, yeah, let's go over to

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,040
the chat, though, real fast. I mean, I just got these things in because I said, hey, what have

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,440
we missed so far? Because there was a barrage there for a bit, so I figured I'll ask again,

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,500
just to remind myself, and I figure if somebody repeats it a couple of times, it must be a little

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,600
more on their mind, you know? Anyways, okay, so the first one comes up is a repeat of a question

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,300
from earlier, which is how to observe a day of atonement, and I think you already talked about

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,040
atonement, but what about a day of atonement? Is there... because I know that in some orders,

18
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,680
there's a holiday and this and that, and, you know, what do you got to say about that,

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,240
like how one observes a day of atonement? Yeah, well, there's instructions in Leviticus 23,

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,419
and just observing it that it exists is good enough, and then the instructions are there,

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,500
basically paraphrasing, you know, what the Jews do. I'm spelling Jews J-O-O-Z. I don't want to

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,300
get in trouble with the defamation league. Oh, big lightning strike. Okay, is no food,

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,660
no water from sundown to sundown, but we know the day starts at noon. I think at this point,

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,120
just acknowledging that it is the day is enough for me. You can be reflective. It's basically a

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,580
day, again, paraphrasing in the King James is to abstain, right? So that would be that,

26
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,020
and I can't really move forward any more other than what's in the text and what I do, and,

27
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,260
you know, right? The text says pretty much afflict yourself, you know, basically deny yourself of

28
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,800
things that you normally do, which could be pretty broad. Also take no food and no water. Some

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
might loosely be interpreted, but in the Jewish Judean tradition, no food, no water for 24 hours,

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,280
let's say, I just acknowledge the day. Sometimes I do that, though. Well, I also think it's healthy

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560
on occasion, not necessarily based on what it is directed, you know, for a particular day,

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
but isn't it a healthy thing to do from now on, you know, from time to time to abstain a bit

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,120
and be reflective anyway? Yeah, I don't know. It depends on what you want to do with your health.

34
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,340
Yeah. Like if you're going to run a marathon tomorrow, which the marathon is never really

35
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,860
scheduled, but it could be you don't want to do that. No, of course not. I mean, you got to have

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,660
fuel in order to, you know, you got to you got to have things to work with if you're doing something

37
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,320
like that. But I'm saying from time to time, it's probably not a bad thing to pause in your regular

38
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,940
routines and be reflective anyway. I mean, that's just generally a good thing to do from time to

39
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,440
time. And fasting is not a bad thing at all. No, I mean, it depends on what your focus is on. If

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,440
the mind is really going, it doesn't need much until it's, you know, until it does. Right.

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
I mean, I I've gone eight hours sleep in a week and eight ounces of food in a week,

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
you know, and I didn't, you know, because I've been that wrapped up in what I was doing

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,420
cognitively. Fair enough. So it was also mentioned in the chat that you had mentioned

44
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,899
in an earlier sonic about an ethereal parasite detox. Now, I don't remember you wording it that

45
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,220
way. But, you know, from time to time, do I? Yeah. From time to time, though, there are ethereal

46
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:32,080
concerns. And I guess there are, well, presences, entities that could be considered parasites.

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,340
Good. I'm going to stop. Stop you right there. I don't recall ever writing that. Please,

48
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,720
someone bring it up. If I did. Yeah. Might have been the parallel me. Right.

49
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,520
Because I don't think there's such a thing as a detox, really. And but there are ethereal

50
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,480
parasites more in the mind parasite because ethereal go many ways, which I'll describe again

51
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,760
later. Let's mix that one for now. OK, no problem. But it is I think it's an interesting question.

52
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Nonetheless, I just don't recall you bringing it up before. So anyway, they would also like to

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:10,760
hear about a return of Adam as spoken of in the biblical text. So what about that? Because we

54
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,260
talked about Adam, a sonic or two ago, and you had mentioned, you know, what that means or what

55
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,960
that could mean in general. Right. And I asked you about, well, what about this idea of combining

56
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,680
these existing creatures into something else and therefore creating another creature, which

57
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,380
seems to be the walking upright inhabitants currently walking around.

58
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,760
And, you know, we got into a conversation there. But what about that? What about the biblical

59
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,860
notion of this in the story, the return of Adam? I'm not there is nothing. Yeah,

60
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,460
there's nothing there. And about that. So that's a there's nothing in Scripture about

61
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,780
the return of Adam. And if I'm wrong, I'd like to please show me where it is.

62
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,440
OK, excellent. So there you go. We've covered the three things that I had

63
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,960
from the chat that I picked up really quickly. So you said you had a couple of things on your

64
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,740
mind, though, that you wanted to relate. So there you are. Yeah, a couple of things,

65
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,500
three things. First one's kind of heavy. The second one's kind of lighter. And the third

66
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,520
one's even heavier. OK, so let's do the cell phone thing and get to the most important part first.

67
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,300
Right. Like you said, get important. OK, the heaviest one would be, you know, I talk about

68
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,260
induction and all that. Right. Well, typically when you get into the biological side, you have

69
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,260
to use and it does work very much like the electrical metaphor of coils and capacitors.

70
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,700
Capacitors don't really induce. They charge and discharge. But if you don't know what a capacitor

71
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,240
is, you're a simpleton. You should just not be listening to Greek speak right now and go educate

72
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,560
yourself and then come back. And what a coil, a wound coil is the same. If you're not familiar

73
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,700
with these terms, you're you're too simple to really engage in what I get into because these

74
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,060
concepts are I give analogies for. And by the way, the reason I said it that way is because I have

75
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,400
run into a lot of people that will just, yes, you, yes, yes, yes. And they don't know what a

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,280
capacitor is. Right. Right. It's basically a battery, but it doesn't discharge slowly. It

77
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,000
discharges everything at once, kind of like me when I was 19. But anyway. So, yeah, what I would

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,060
suggest is the concept of induction. This is the most important part is this what inspired this was

79
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,260
I have the whole house wired with speakers and I play things in the background anywhere I'm

80
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,880
working or whatever I hear. So I had a look at what's the ugly fat man doing? Ken Wheeler put

81
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,200
him on and he was talking about dissectable capacitor, but he's not speaking of a dissectable

82
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,300
capacitor in the way that I've seen it. But similar is basically knocking the MIT guys for

83
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,300
not understanding what they're doing. But I want to get into what that is real quick.

84
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,240
And I think everyone here understands that nothing is absorbed. Nothing goes through any of the

85
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,040
tissue directly. Right. It's all has to go into energy. So if you have a salt intake in your body,

86
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:10,660
the salt has to go through the mouth, let's say, esophagus, stomach, duodenum,

87
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,480
and all that, and then go through the body through induction. The induction actually starts in the

88
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,860
mouth. And once it passes, let's say it's you know, they say digestion starts and with your saliva,

89
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,920
of course, that's why you should chew well, right? Right. So as you proceed all the way down to the

90
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,900
rectum, the parts of the salt, depending on which part of the body gets converted to pure energy,

91
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,620
well, actually, the salt goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas to energy through the wall as

92
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,220
energy. And it appears on the blood side, the inside of the body as energy first, then a gas,

93
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,460
then a liquid, then a solid. OK. OK. So this is how when someone tests blood, this is how when

94
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,960
someone tests blood and they detect like something like a salt level, it's because it was induced in

95
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,160
that way. It is not a direct transfer where it's so through a poor or something. Right.

96
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,180
It's not physical at all. Right. So let's go back to the concept of a dissectible capacitor,

97
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,160
a capacitor defined as it is, is basically a dielectric in the metal. So that's something

98
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,320
that conventionally conducts electricity and something that doesn't layered and somehow it

99
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,480
stores energy. OK. A dissectible capacity is a capacitor is something where you charge it and

100
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,100
then you can obviously see the discharge when you short it out. Right. Or discharge it. But

101
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,560
a dissectible capacitor, instead of after charging it, you instead of discharging it,

102
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,480
you dissect it very carefully. And the dissection, it's built in a way that you can take it apart.

103
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,200
In other words, separate the metal and nonmetal components where you don't discharge anything.

104
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,820
Right. And what's interesting. So if you a simple way to do this is take two aluminum

105
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,200
plates about the size of a square tile. You know, the commercial floor tiles, 12 by 12.

106
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,080
OK. Right. You know, you see at Walmart or everywhere, you know, take two aluminum plates

107
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,480
that size and a piece of mylar, which is like thin plastic sheet about the same size. Right.

108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,340
So if you put the thin sheet of mylar between the two plates of aluminum and you put a circuit

109
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,800
across the aluminum, let's say 5000 volts, use an old neon sign power supply, by the way. Right.

110
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,420
It was really cheap. They kill you, by the way, if you're not careful because they're very strong.

111
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Yeah. So you get this thing charged up and it just sits there. It's not doing anything.

112
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,060
But if you go to ground it, you see this big spark because you hit it with 5000 volts. Right.

113
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,600
So what you want to do in this case is put on some gloves, use some wood. Wood is a very good

114
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,540
insulator. Go ahead and charge the two aluminum plates with the mylar in the middle. Very carefully

115
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,200
lift up one of the plates, aluminum plates, and then carefully pull the mylar away. So instead

116
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,440
of it being a stack of aluminum, mylar and aluminum, you have the three things spread out

117
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,540
away from each other. Right. Now, go ahead and ground each piece independently with your ground

118
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,660
wire. Nothing happens. As a matter of fact, when you put as long as you separate the pieces,

119
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,020
you can do anything you want. You can put them in the dishwasher and run it through a full cycle,

120
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,440
each piece. But once you stack them again, as they were carefully and you touch them with a

121
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,560
ground wire, whether it's a minute later, a year later, five years later, a month later,

122
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,700
guess what happens when you restack them? Boom, you get a discharge just exactly almost identical

123
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,040
to the charging that you initially did before you dissected it. Pretty incredible, right?

124
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,940
Here's the interesting part. Most people would think that the charge is being held in the metal.

125
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,460
So here's what I was thinking. Yeah. It's actually being held in the mylar because what you do,

126
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,100
if you take those two aluminum plates, because when I say there's two places,

127
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,460
let's consider they're one thing because they're both the same, right? Okay. Go buy,

128
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,560
go buy a new piece of mylar, stick it in there. Nothing. Right. If you get two new aluminum

129
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,720
plates with the old mylar that's charged that you dissected without discharging,

130
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,980
put it between two new aluminum plates, boom, discharges. Okay. You know what's even more

131
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,180
interesting? I'm in Tucson, you're in Georgia, right? Yeah. Right. All right. I'm going to set

132
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,240
this up and I'm going to do the mylar, pull the mylar out. I'm going to put it in a postal tube,

133
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,840
you know, like a round poster tube, you know, and I'm going to mail it to you. Okay. I'm going to

134
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,160
mail it to you. And like a month after you get it, take it out and go get two aluminum plates

135
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,180
and stick everything together and ground it. Guess what happens? Boom, discharge.

136
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,200
Isn't that amazing? So it's like the mylar and the non-metal is holding this memory,

137
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,620
but it needs the metal to transfer it and ground it out. Now there's an old video,

138
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,340
I don't know if it's still up, Dissectible Capacitor. It's two like old ex hippies,

139
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,060
electronics guys on a bench. So the video is very grainy and they actually demonstrate everything I

140
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,200
just said. And it's very exciting when I talk about it, you can hear me be very excited about

141
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,440
it because it's repeated. Anyone can do it. The only time you really focus, if you, if you're

142
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,460
going to do an electrical discharge, it's nice to have a spark, right? Because any, this way,

143
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,760
everyone in the audience or everyone watching can see it. If you, if you charge it with a low

144
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,400
voltage, you're not, you need a meter, you know, and you'll see the meter bounce a little. It's

145
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,840
not very fun. You get sparks. It's easy to discern that something is happening. Yeah.

146
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,500
It's kind of like back in the old days when you're young and your older cousin, you know,

147
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,720
you, you pull a lawnmower, he says, hold onto this. And you're holding onto the spark plug.

148
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,340
Why are you pulling it? You know, he said, you don't know. Right. It feels like you got bit. It's

149
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,820
called like getting bit with a high spark. Okay. So this is what's going on. So let's go back to

150
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:43,080
induction because when a capacitor charges, it actually creates a discharging in a coil. And when

151
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:50,260
a coil charges, it actually creates a discharging in a capacitor. So that that's not the focus.

152
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,900
The body works on induction, more like a coil, but it also holds a charge. So how about this?

153
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,380
This is the most important part that I wanted to convey. And I've been thinking about this and

154
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,560
working on this for quite a while now, like more than a year. And now I'm getting into when I pass

155
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,780
the phase I'm in right now with supplying industrial stuff like I'm doing in water devices,

156
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm going to start going back into this and I'm going to actually share it with people

157
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,560
and things they can do. Don't hold me to it. In other words, I might get too busy to

158
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,660
get because this is serious stuff and takes a lot of time. And Chuck, we've spoken off,

159
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,240
you know, the Sonics. And you see, when I get into something, it's it's not 100 percent,

160
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,320
it's 150 percent. Right. Right. So this is going to need 155 percent. So I'd like to just put this

161
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,400
out as a preempting to other people to get people ready. So we know since the body and I'm saying

162
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,540
this, we know not for plausible deniability, but there is no way that anything passes through the

163
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,440
body. It's all by induction. This is very easily established. It's just not talked about. It's

164
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,380
denied by the establishment. All right. So you have this charge, this induction that happens

165
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,160
in the midpoint between the transfer happens from inside to outside the body. Right. OK,

166
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,000
so now we have a dissectable capacitor. We can actually take a condition,

167
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,840
biological condition, whether it's health, disease, sickness or nutrition.

168
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,900
Right. Forward bias, if you remember how we talked about forward biasing the silver,

169
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,400
someone said, what about silver coins in water? Isn't that enough? Well, the silver coin has a

170
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,500
atmosphere around it and you want to push it off with a little bit of electricity into the water.

171
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,120
And then you see a bias, just like a tape recorder. You have a forward bias. Right. You need

172
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,120
a little bit just to get that tape going. Right. Just for that energetic transfer. It needs that

173
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,060
bit of forward bias, a little push using energy. So you have all of these other things that we

174
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,380
describe, which are actually physical conditions and nutrition or nutrients and what gives things

175
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,740
its quality. Like, for example, I say nutrients. Let's say you've got a loaf of bread and a bowl

176
00:15:52,740 --> 00:16:01,640
of spinach and some milk. Each one has a different nutritional value in reality in terms of vitality.

177
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,980
Right. One will do this. One will do like if you want to gain 50 pounds in a month,

178
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,060
eat a whole loaf of bread before you go to sleep, eat a whole loaf of bread and go immediately to

179
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,240
sleep. I assure you, you're going to gain anywhere between 30 to 50 pounds in a month.

180
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,120
That's how actors do it when they have to gain weight for a role. Right. Right. If you want

181
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,160
to feel depressed, go ahead and drink a quart of milk a day. Dairy is depressive. That's that's

182
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,120
something that you agree. These are just generalities. And the spinach, you get that

183
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,520
gritty feeling on your teeth. Like, honey, did you watch the spinach? Well, my teeth are really

184
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,820
that's oxalic acid. Right. OK. So that's why you always have spinach with dairy. You ever notice

185
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,680
a lot of spinach dishes have dairy cheese mixed with cheese or butter?

186
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,280
OK, so these are three different examples. So now we know that you have back to the

187
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,180
dissectible capacitor. You have metal and nonmetal. Right. To make the capacitor. Remember, I said it

188
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,880
was milder. It could have been paper. But you don't want to use paper because it absorbs humidity.

189
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,420
Right. Changes. Right. But plastic or whatever leather, you know, if that absorbs humidity,

190
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,940
something oily would work well. OK, so you need to make the capacitor. You make a metal

191
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,640
sandwich basically. Right. The metal on the outside and the nonmetal on the inside. Right.

192
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,540
And the outside of the metal, the two metal plates, one is positive, one is negative. Right.

193
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,579
And what holds the charge is the nonmetal. Let me ask you, is milk metal or nonmetal?

194
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,300
Nonmetal. Well, it's nonmetal. Yeah. I mean, I'm like thinking there. Wait a minute. There's no

195
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,840
metal. No, it shouldn't be. Should not be. Actually, remember the cereal that you have

196
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,400
seen the YouTube's with the magnet with the breakfast cereal and it moves towards the magnet.

197
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've seen that before. Yeah. OK. All right. So then you've got bread. Is that metal

198
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,060
or nonmetal? It should not have metal in it. Exactly. Spinach and metal or nonmetal. OK.

199
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,540
So all these nutritive things are nonmetal items. Make a metal sandwich forward, biased it into

200
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,780
the body. Guess what happens? That's all I'm going to say. We'll take it forward later. How

201
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,960
do you get it to the body? Because the body accepts the charge. Right. And here's the interesting

202
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,000
thing. If I accept the charge in Tucson in my body, I could walk over no matter where I walk

203
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,120
until I discharge that. Right. I'm going to be holding that charge. Oh, that's like the trick

204
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,240
with the static electricity, that kind of thing. Yeah. To the capacitor. Yeah. Dissected. You know,

205
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,800
if I take the capacitor apart without shorting it out, I could mail you the pieces and you could

206
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,580
put them together and you'll get the spark. Right. Right. As long as you put them together like

207
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:43,480
they were initially. OK. It's very cool, isn't it? That's it. I've never thought of it this way.

208
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,840
It's a wild thought. Yeah. It's really low tech stuff. You couldn't get any more low tech than

209
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,020
this. Well, yeah, but it's never the way you're taught about these things, though. You know,

210
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,780
it's never what you generally observe when somebody explains, you know, even how to deal

211
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,960
with a battery or whatever. You don't hear about it this way. Well, if they didn't teach you,

212
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,620
I guess then those that are supposed to be teaching you don't have your best interest in

213
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,720
mind, then do they? That seems to be the point here. Yeah. OK. So that was the important part.

214
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,080
I gave that first and it was rather lengthy, but I'm glad we got that out because this is what I

215
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,880
would say I'm looking forward to working on. Right. How do we mimic biological induction?

216
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Very simply. Right. OK. And that's all I'm going to say right now. There's a lot more I can do. I

217
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,340
might do some solos with it as it goes on, but I'll always bring it back. Great. I mean, back

218
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,780
to what we can do here. Right. So, OK, the SEC, let's go back. Let's go back to the first thing

219
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,980
I wanted to say. OK. It's sort of this is going to sound like science, but it's not. OK. You know,

220
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,960
when we look at things you're taught in chemistry in school and the periodic table of elements,

221
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,560
you have elements. And the reason they call them elements is because they're pure and they don't

222
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,760
change and they define what they are by being what they are. Like hydrogen is a first element,

223
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,720
then helium and lithium. Right. OK. And the reason it's called an element is because it's not mixed

224
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,420
with anything. It's unique. Yeah. It just is what it is. Unique. Right. Right. OK. Well,

225
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,940
on one hand, you have this thing where you have these alchemists supposedly that take

226
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,660
base metals and turn them into noble materials. Actually, that's the you very rarely find that

227
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,940
the alchemic thing is to take base metal and turn it into a noble metal, you know,

228
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,220
lead to gold. It's always taking base metals and turning them into a more noble things.

229
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,360
It could be gases and other. But anyway, let's just say you've heard of turning lead to gold,

230
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,600
taking base metal and turning it. You know, iron goes to platinum, right? Copper goes to gold.

231
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,380
OK. This is the alchemic thing. Now, the alchemic thing is to change something that is very unique

232
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:50,180
into something else that is very unique. So lead is an element. And alchemists would take the lead,

233
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,100
which is known as lead. And it's an element because it's unique to itself being lead as

234
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,820
an element. Take that and then change it to another element. Right. OK. So this is the

235
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,540
premise of what not the last sonic, but the previous sonic. You know, I kind of laid into

236
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:12,100
what spiritual is and what it is and how simple it was. And you cannot discuss that without just

237
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,560
like it's like a wet newspaper across the head. It's the only way to deliver something like that,

238
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,660
because everything is spiritual, right? Unless you're laying down in a sleep or in a coma,

239
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,280
if you're not behaving, not talking, not thinking, there's nothing spiritual. The moment there's any

240
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,380
movement, behavior, expression, communication, anything, it's all spiritual because it's of

241
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,480
the mind. Right. Pretty much the way I see it is the moment that there is animation. Yeah,

242
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,080
that's it. Yeah. We basically broke it down to what it really is. So when there's spiritual

243
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,700
discussion, if you're having if you're asking that, it's kind of like, can I ask you a question?

244
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,780
You just did. Right. Kind of like that. Right. So any discussion is a spiritual discussion. So

245
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,460
one thing in the definition of the spirit that I've been getting into is that other unlike the

246
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,240
soul, which everyone shares, it's the metabolism. You can you know, the soul is your metabolism.

247
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,120
So, you know, if you can't breathe, someone administers CPR resuscitation, they're putting

248
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,460
their soul into your body until you carry on with your own soul. Right. Okay. So it's

249
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,840
interchangeable. Most things in mammals, let's say, and others, let's say is simple. I don't

250
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,740
know if you should try resuscitating a fish. I've been using a lot of fish analogies lately,

251
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,840
but I don't know if I've ever seen or heard of that before. But, you know,

252
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,080
I can make a really bad lascivious joke on that one, but I won't. Okay. Okay. So

253
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,890
the soul is more common to the metabolism. Right. But the spirit is what do I always say?

254
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:50,170
And what can be said is the spirit is what makes you you sort of like an element. Everyone is

255
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,130
different. Everyone is you. Even the people that look alike, it might be like they're still

256
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,990
very distinct. Nature abhors carbon copies. Even with a clone, there'll be a distinct difference

257
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,390
of some kind. Right. So even when you see identical twins, there's always a divergence.

258
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,670
Yeah. Yeah. And that's, again, a very strong spiritual connection. When one dies,

259
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,190
the other one feels it. Or when one is happy, the other one feels it. When one's sad, the other one

260
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,470
feels it. Right. Right. Okay. So what's cool is I know some identical twins. One guy lost his

261
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,030
driver's license from drunk driving, and he needed to use the car. He just uses his identical twin's

262
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,410
driver's license, same birthday, same face. Yeah, as long as they don't fingerprint them,

263
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,230
we're fine. See, there you go. The fingerprints don't match, though.

264
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,190
Yeah, they might. You could always argue that fingerprints are only good for one out of 400,000.

265
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,150
Yeah, I know. That's another whole thing. I know. That's just I think the number I heard. But you

266
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,550
know, I don't know if it's that extreme, but I do know that it's not as reliable as people

267
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:54,770
think it is. But I just used it as DNA. We all have the same DNA. Right. So the interesting point

268
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:01,010
here is going back to the element, the spirit is you're you are in a spiritual sense, you are

269
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,050
elemental to yourself. It's not like you're all this hydrogen, all these other things,

270
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,210
you see periodic table, you are you elemental to yourself. You're very unique. There's only

271
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,930
one of you. I'm not trying to be airy, fairy, happy, clappy. I'm saying you are you in the

272
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:22,230
truest sense, very unique being like an element. So when someone is to perform alchemy, they would

273
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,710
actually work on changing their spirit, because your spirit is what defines you. So when you do a

274
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,810
spiritual change, it's actually a form of alchemy. That's why it's so hard for people to change.

275
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,030
Because they there's the view themselves, you know, for the better or the worse,

276
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,070
actually, it's easier to corrupt someone than to make someone corrupt, not be corrupt, right. So

277
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,570
it's true. Also, with if you have, let's say something that's pure, it's easy to make it

278
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,830
impure. And then if you want to make it pure, again, go ahead, it's real hard, even with water,

279
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,310
right? It's difficult to get the impurities out. Yeah, it's always more difficult in that direction,

280
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,610
going from impure to pure. So there's many people that say they want to be better, they want to do

281
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,850
things better. And when they're shown the they kind of resist it, because they're not capable

282
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,830
or not aware of the alchemical changes need to be made to themselves. Because changing yourself is

283
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,690
literally an alchemic process, no different than changing lead to gold. Well, and you can see that

284
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,890
because it just changing your attitude, as we talked about during the emo discussions, right,

285
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,170
just changing your attitude. What's that behavior? That's the behavior aspect. Yeah. But behaviorally,

286
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,390
just by changing your posture by changing the way you decide to carry yourself the way you dress,

287
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,610
these things can change your attitude, which changes your actions, so on and so forth. The

288
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:43,350
domino effect, right? Of sorts. Sort of, but I'm saying that when you change yourself,

289
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,070
give you an example. When I found out everything, I knew everything was fictional.

290
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,050
And I really did not want to be the person that I was three decades ago.

291
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,050
I had a box of my memorabilia, I just took it all through it in the garbage baby pictures,

292
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,390
they know certificates, memorabilia, love letters from you know, whatever. So this isn't me.

293
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,530
Because when I got all this stuff, I was believing that this world was real.

294
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:15,190
Or what they were telling me was true. You see? Yeah, when I see an artifact from earlier part of

295
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,030
my life, which is a rare thing for me, but when I do see an artifact from an earlier part of my

296
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,030
life, I am very disconnected from it. Because I don't recognize who I was at that point. Because

297
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,190
I, I change. Yeah, exactly. But these are things you can do, just like someone would do a certain

298
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,110
process, you know, when they bring out, they have to make a certain fire or crucible, it has to go

299
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:39,130
through this, you know, acid first, and then cooked at this temperature to turn to gold, right? You

300
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,130
see this in the movies is the Hollywood version of that doesn't really go to gold. Okay, so

301
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,130
that's why they promote it in the Hollywood version. So So this is an interesting thing. So

302
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,470
a personal alchemy. So, you know, this is have you, I don't this is not I looked around for there's

303
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,950
none of this, this kind of talk doesn't exist. By the way, I looked around a little bit on the

304
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,170
internet the other day for this, right? Yeah, something along the speech to see if anyone so

305
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:10,650
now we're now we're putting down traces for plowing on new ground, right? So I just wanted

306
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,450
to put that out. Let's get to the second and last thing if you're not confused by now, right? We're

307
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:21,830
going to the second and last thing. And then second and last thing was, was the second one

308
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,010
kind of third, actually, because you started with the discussion about the battery in the third,

309
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,850
which was the last I started with the last thing that we went to the first now we're going to the

310
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,850
second Oh, excellent. Important. Yeah, there you go. So there's something called, you know,

311
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,890
the for people do castaneda and whatever, the recapitulation and in the castaneda writings,

312
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,850
from Don Juan, it's they had this exercise where you you put out some time and you go and rip

313
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,430
recapitulate bring back in memory, not just in memory, but the feelings and everything,

314
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,290
basically the email of past experiences and work them through work them out. And I've discussed

315
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,550
through Greek speak how that happens anyway. Can I just ask you about a term here? Because

316
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,930
you use the term recapitulate. And that sounds a bit wishy washy and complex to me because

317
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,470
yeah, it just means go back and remember, go back and remember. Okay, because it sounds to me more

318
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:18,610
like go back and give up. You know, yeah. Did I say recapitulate? Yeah. But maybe I'm not using

319
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,590
the right word. I just did. That's what it did. That's how it struck my ears. It sounds like to

320
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,550
give up again. Yeah, to go back and work things through. Okay, now he does it basically, you do

321
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,210
this at some point in your life, you make a box, you spend hours in it for days and weeks or

322
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,690
in a tree or whatever. I'm like, no, no, no, no. Okay. You do it every day. You do it every day.

323
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,470
When you start becoming aware that the spirit is something that can be worked out and made stronger,

324
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,310
just like when did you discover that if you go to the gym and work out or do exercise,

325
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,610
your body will get stronger, right? Well, we talked about this when we discuss muscle memory,

326
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,670
basically, that if you do something in a ritualistic way, if you do something religiously,

327
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,710
okay, it becomes an automatic and therefore doesn't require a lot of forethought and etc.

328
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,290
So we Yeah, we went through this. Sure.

329
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:12,470
But the discovery of it ritualistic way is, you know, like, rituals are spiritual algorithms.

330
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,350
Just define them that way. Green Greek speak definition. Well, true. But even going to the

331
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,230
gym on a daily basis or on a, you know, every other day basis that becomes religious. Yeah,

332
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,690
because something a ritual ritual would be a spiritual algorithm, like an algorithm would be

333
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,670
for, you know, in a logic sense. Okay. In other words, if you don't do the ritual, right,

334
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,050
or pronounce something wrong in a grimoire doesn't work, right? It's an algorithm, just like if you

335
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,290
punch code in the computer out wrong, one, you know, the wrong space, or the right, it won't

336
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,950
work. Gotcha. So ritualistic is specific, religious is just repetitive, and therefore,

337
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,850
okay, routine, routine, religion, religion is routine, by the way, look at people go to church

338
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:56,750
on Sunday, right? Yeah, routine. Yeah. Okay. So what I'm suggesting is at the end of the day,

339
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,150
before you sleep, or even not before you sleep, as you're winding down, think of the entire day,

340
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,410
since you woke up and more of the prominent things, why? And do this every day. The reason

341
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,470
why is you'll start picking up all of the influences that you didn't notice you, you

342
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,510
recapitulate or remember each day, all of the things that you may be too busy to focus on other

343
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,910
things, they will come to you. And you will start seeing patterns, maybe there was thoughts in your

344
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:28,790
head, that you will pick up were not yours. And what was right, you'll see weird synchronicities

345
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,910
that you normally wouldn't pick up. And then you start seeing these patterns. And then you start to

346
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,050
see what spiritual influences are happening in your, in your life on a day to day basis,

347
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,510
non physical ones, as well as the physical ones. By the way, this is how you learn,

348
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,650
like the mailman always comes in between one and 3pm. Right? You learn that by remembering it,

349
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:56,850
right? Right. So, so these things, you do them with your life, do them every day. It doesn't

350
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,150
mean that right before you go to bed, but towards the end of the day, think of your day and in not

351
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,190
about what necessarily you did, but what happened, what occurred, what you were involved in,

352
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,670
and start adding those up. And you will start to see patterns and influences much more clearly.

353
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,590
And then that was the second thing.

354
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,710
Well, and then that'll allow you to anticipate those things to like you said, with the mailman,

355
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,070
because okay, the way I handled the mailman is I know by a certain time of day on the clock,

356
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,550
it's a good time to go check the mail because it's likely to be there.

357
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,290
You know, I could tell you how the way my ex girlfriend handled the mailman,

358
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,950
but that wouldn't be right. Well, you know, look, I don't want to hear about your heartbreak today.

359
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:41,950
I never had, you know, these things are like ripe and fertile for coffee. Of course they are. No,

360
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:47,110
I look, you know, it's just, it's just like, look, I'm very sure that you look like the mailman

361
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,970
because that's just the way your mom was. I know it's okay. You know, you can, you can do it that

362
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,470
way too. This is very right. Yeah. Any, any conversation can be right in any direction,

363
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,630
usually, but the lascivious part is just too easy sometimes. I wonder if that's more of an,

364
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,230
is that more of an East coast thing? You think I really wonder about the personal choice thing

365
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,190
because a lot of the jokes, you know, you, the, the witnessing with Eddie Murphy in the eighties,

366
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,770
everything went like, you know, it was very, that shock culture came out before that it was

367
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,730
George Carlin or whatever. George Carlin was shocking in the sixties, right? You know what

368
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,310
I mean? He's mild compared to other things. So it goes back and forth. It's a personal choice,

369
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:31,030
but here's the thing. Let me just jump back to Castaneda. The reason why he suggested the

370
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,170
recapitulation is that way. He suggests that it frees you because what you're basically doing is

371
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,890
you hear like a near death experience. Life flashes before you write your entire life. Essentially,

372
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:47,950
that's what you're doing because that's what you're here for. So pretty much download or upload all of

373
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,350
your life experiences to a being he calls the Eagle that takes that and thrives on that. But

374
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,030
if you're already recapitulated everything and you don't have that experience when you die,

375
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:03,370
he lets you go and you move on to being in a higher space, right? That's the reason that

376
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,950
they give from the tall tech tradition. Well, it doesn't almost anyone who's aware that they are,

377
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,410
you know, at the end of life. I mean, pretty much I've never known anyone who didn't reflect

378
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,970
on something if they were aware that, you know, without the, without the case of sudden death,

379
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,750
you know, something totally unexpected car crashes kind of thing. Sure. But the custom

380
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,850
native point was that, that, that commonality of recapitulating and having your whole life

381
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:32,070
before you before you pass is not a normal function. It's a function of another being

382
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,570
that comes and gets you that he was here to pick that up when you pass,

383
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,370
and it's extracting it from you. So if you're already have extracted perform that

384
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,550
you're free from that being at the point of death, and you can move on without being under its

385
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,690
hold, let's say or control. So that's separation. Yeah, I'm sorry,

386
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,830
that's separation. You don't think it's metaphoric, and therefore also a part of the being

387
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,910
it is a separate being feeds off of that, just like we are in a being where the earth is in a

388
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,550
track. For example, let me just suggest it like this. The earth where it is in orbit is in an

389
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:16,010
orbit where another world is here. It's a non physical world. And when the earth came here,

390
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,969
and it's in the orbit or in the zone or in the area of this other non physical world, it doesn't

391
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,250
because it's not physical, it doesn't mind the physical intrusion, but it sees all of our energy.

392
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:31,170
So it's kind of like imagine Las Vegas in the 50s. And while Las Vegas looks now when the

393
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,830
earth showed up, it got really colorful for these other beings. And they're the ones that put

394
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,010
things in your head, by the way, in the right, they're very evolved,

395
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,790
by the way, non physical. So So this is like the the conversations to be had

396
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,190
in many, many ways that we can't really say are for sure. But they're wonderful to think about

397
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,929
if you have a way to, let's say work around them in your own way, to maintain your strength and

398
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,850
sanity here. I mentioned, these are broadcast tomatoes, I've been listening to a lot of this

399
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,610
stuff. And it's like, it sounds just like Greek speak. And this was mentioned, I've never read

400
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,030
it. And it's been was mentioned to me people that were into it in the 80s. And they would bring up

401
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:15,970
metaphors. And that sounds pretty like some wisdom, whatever, but, but it's Toltec shamanism,

402
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:25,090
basically. And I suggest that doing it on a daily basis will benefit you more on little steps,

403
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,650
right, like grains of sand in an hourglass instead of a shovel of sand in the end, you know what I

404
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:35,610
mean? And that's was that's, the first part was the alchemic nature of the spirit and how why it's

405
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:41,110
so difficult for people to change. It's like changing lead to gold. It requires an alchemist

406
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:45,730
to be an alchemist with your spirit, you can actually do it. And for the betterment, right?

407
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,830
So in other words, if you find that very often, I hear people say, I'm not good at math, right?

408
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,130
I'm like, good, that's great. I thank you for telling me now I'm going to remember remind you,

409
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,130
now you know what to work on, because most people go through their whole life like that, right? I'm

410
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,850
not good at math. So everyone pats him on the back, that's okay. But when you tell me you're

411
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,830
not good at something, I said, Oh, is it right if I remind you that you should be working on that?

412
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,790
Now you know what to work on? How can you be bored? I think you brought up being bored or

413
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:15,450
something. Yeah. You know, I know to work on now why? Why would I do that? Oh, the Greeks are real

414
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,190
asshole. He makes me want to work on math. And I told him I wasn't good at math. No. The point

415
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:25,230
here is this, it's an indirect way to say that if you actually take your what you admit to be a

416
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,910
weakness, and work on it, so it's no longer a weakness, I didn't say make it a strength,

417
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,390
no longer a weakness, what do you think it's going to do in terms of technique and abilities

418
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,490
for the things that you consider yourself to be already strong in? It'll make you what even

419
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,090
stronger, right? So you learn new ways, right? And also gets rid of spiritual emotional laziness.

420
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:53,350
So I just wanted to throw those things out there. And the second thing was the room at the end of

421
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:58,270
the day, rehash your day, and you'll see patterns and non physical influences very clearly,

422
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,890
more clearly as you do it. And the third thing was, let's start working on real induction

423
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:09,150
in a very simple fashion. Now with those non physical, you know, interactions that we're

424
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,350
talking about here, is there a possibility that in some cases you get induction in that way?

425
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:20,590
I mean, where you certainly have energetic? Yeah, it's non physical. Yeah, it's non physical.

426
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,370
Because let's go back to the analogy that I always gave you look at the intestines,

427
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,350
nothing penetrates through that they should do cross section of the intestines or any of the

428
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,930
tissues, lungs, skin, whatever, do cross split the computer screen or whatever and do a cross

429
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,970
section of a steel belted radial tire, they're the same. In other words, they're two,

430
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,790
you structurally, they're the same, you know, what is it? What is the purpose of an automotive tire?

431
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,890
For the inner environment, not to call us with the outer environment, right? Because if it doesn't,

432
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,910
you have a flat, right? Yeah, it doesn't work. So it's structurally set up to separate the two

433
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,730
using pressure, and the same with the human body. So how do you have the interaction

434
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:05,670
by induction goes from solid, to liquid, to gas to energy back in reverse on the inside of the

435
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,050
body and in reverse, when the body wants to get rid of something, it turns into energy,

436
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,830
right? solid liquid gas into the bladder into the kidney into certain ducts into the sweat

437
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:25,050
into the skin, right? Okay. So that's, that's basically the premise is this, this, this

438
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,610
interaction.
