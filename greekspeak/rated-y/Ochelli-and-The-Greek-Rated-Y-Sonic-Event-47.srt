1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,720
Well, here we are again.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,400
And what is this 47 right?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,000
47?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,380
Yeah, I think so.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,840
Can be.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,800
I've lost count.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,240
I lost count after three.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,140
After three?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,160
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,540
Okay.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm not even counting.

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,860
I don't think these things are getting titled.

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,900
They're just getting numbers.

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,020
So each one is its own individual packaged, whatever.

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,700
Oh, before we get started, I just want to say, we do still have newcomers, and I don't

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,440
know where to direct newcomers for the background stuff other than starting back at number one,

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,380
because it is cumulative to a certain degree, right?

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,940
Well, if you look for the others, and I think there's going to be a solution in the next

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,440
month or so where they'll be able to get all of the background stuff in one place.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,260
And that's going to occur.

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,040
I don't want to talk about it yet, but we are going to organize it so you can get all

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,780
the background stuff.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,380
Not just these conversations between you and I, but other things that you've done.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,160
I think we're going to come up with a way to streamline that.

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,920
So to be easier.

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
From ab initio, from the beginning.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,920
Yes, exactly.

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,440
That way, well, from the beginning of what it is we have recorded that we have access

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,480
to because, you know, you talk about talking in the 90s.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,020
I've never heard any of that stuff.

31
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,340
Oh, early 2000s, really?

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,200
Oh, I've been talking since the 80s.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,480
More listening during the 80s, because all the stuff you see, people talking about flat

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,520
Earth and the simulation, all that, I was subjected to that very heavily in the 80s.

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
You know, consciousness and all that stuff.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,760
You know, I wonder if that is a product of the area of the country that you and I were

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,960
both in, because I hear from a lot of other people, they never heard those discussions.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,580
But I know that we had those discussions in that area, face to face, directly.

39
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah, it is geographic, which has some pertinence to what I want to talk about tonight, which

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,740
is ennoblement and safety.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,800
And neither one has anything to do with what people think when you hear those words.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,740
Yeah, so.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,420
Yeah, well, noble is an interesting word.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,180
OK, so we're at 47, good enough.

45
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,460
And by the way, somebody did ask me to start dating them.

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,259
And I asked them, yeah, according to what, though?

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,680
You want the Pope's work schedule or you want, you know, just keep the numbers.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,140
It's fine.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,580
It's kind of like, what is it?

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
Playing cards are like that, aren't they?

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
What do we do when we get to 52?

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,420
Who's the joker anyway?

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Well, that's 53 and 54, right?

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,060
Because that's how you get to anyway, 52 pick up.

55
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,940
Of course, we were all subjected to that at some point.

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,180
Right.

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,140
You want to play 52 pick up, Greg?

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,020
I'm sure somebody.

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,380
Yeah.

60
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,300
Well, anyway.

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,720
Yeah.

62
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,220
So go ahead.

63
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, maybe or no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,700
I'll leave that.

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:35,900
Yeah.

66
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,020
Because the word noble is interesting.

67
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,380
Yeah.

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,900
Yeah.

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
I got you on that earlier.

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,160
It's just what it means.

71
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,120
You could do it with material in society.

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,880
You have the nobles.

73
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,740
Then you have the base.

74
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,000
Right.

75
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Base are the masses.

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,660
And the same with value added to things.

77
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,540
Precious metals, gases that are inert, things like that are noble and base are not, you know,

78
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,920
noble.

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,320
See, what's funny is, though, is I would say that some of the people that are described

80
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,200
as nobles are not often people who act with noble character because there is such a thing

81
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
as noble character, is there not?

82
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,040
So is there is there a difference between something that is simply named it by by virtue

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,380
of its creation, by virtue of its innate characteristics or its its given characteristics upon creation?

84
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,000
And how about actions?

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,180
What you can do with it?

86
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:25,760
Sure.

87
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,380
But let's rewind the tape.

88
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,780
OK.

89
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,420
If there is such a thing anymore.

90
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
You actually there might be.

91
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,620
Rewind.

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,580
I didn't say people.

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
I said society.

94
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,780
Well, yeah.

95
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,720
In other words, it's a demarcation in society.

96
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Like, for example, when you speak of noble metals, you know, you look at the precious

97
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,040
metals.

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,180
And but at one point when aluminum was considered to be, let's say, put into society again,

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,940
it was it was it cost more than gold at the time in the late eighteen hundreds.

100
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,520
Right.

101
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,080
Right.

102
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,340
Because it was it was very you need electric purification.

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,620
In other words, it's very you cannot really make aluminum as we know it today without electric

104
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,720
refinement.

105
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,420
Right.

106
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,780
Right.

107
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,440
So it was not until that process of electricity got to the point where it was available.

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,500
Right.

109
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,180
So if you had an aluminum piece of anything from the 1890s, you could trade it for a piece

110
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,100
of gold that weighed a lot more than it than it did.

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,460
Right.

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,740
So that was based on rarity, though.

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Right.

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,180
It wasn't that based more on.

115
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,600
But so is the rest.

116
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,740
There's a twilight zone where some astronauts go to a planet and there's diamonds.

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,760
The Street Sweepers sweeping up diamonds.

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,120
Right.

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,880
It's garbage.

121
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,240
Right.

122
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes.

123
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,260
As well on Earth.

124
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,040
These are valuable.

125
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,840
And they laughed at it.

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,060
Right.

127
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,800
Yeah.

128
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,520
Yeah.

129
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
So it's a matter of that also.

130
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,080
But ennobling is that's why I said we're talking about ennobling and safety in a way

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,160
that other people wouldn't hear this, say what they attach to it will not work.

132
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,940
What I meant by ennoblement is of materials.

133
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,400
Years ago, it was very well known that if you had gold of a certain quality, you can even

134
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
increase its quality by burying it in the ground.

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,440
And the ground offered certain to Larrick, etheric to earth, right, energies that would

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,800
keep the the metal not only in its high quality, but actually slowly increase its quality.

137
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,080
Right.

138
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,080
Well, same with wines and if you plant anything in the earth, how it reacts with the earth

139
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,260
creates a different characteristic, very much like planting a seed.

140
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,320
Then it becomes a plant.

141
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,500
Then it sprouts fruit and makes more seeds.

142
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,800
Right.

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm going in a different direction with this, OK, because this has nothing to do really

144
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,220
with the earth per se.

145
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,920
It's a process that one can consider.

146
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,180
In other words, when you go out and select items, material things and for most people,

147
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,080
by the way, knowledge is a material thing.

148
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,240
You know, they don't see it.

149
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,160
This is a slight tangent when we communicate.

150
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,120
Right now, this is probably digital.

151
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,740
So supposedly, it's being broken down to binary and then put back together finally into

152
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,440
some acoustic analog way where we make sense of it.

153
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,680
Right.

154
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,280
Right.

155
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,760
But but the information knowledge itself, once it reaches its terminus in the mind of

156
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,720
the individual, it's no longer digital.

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
It has a flavor.

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,200
In other words, it's not zeros and ones.

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,780
So remember, remember that.

160
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,100
In other words, there is an analog string, you know, it's kind of like.

161
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,140
I think of it much like the energetic, the energetic transfer that we talked about with

162
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,580
the tapes.

163
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:32,980
Right.

164
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,720
And tape.

165
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,620
Yes, it might be an antiquated thing at this point.

166
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,760
But this concept that you literally do put different tones, different representations,

167
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,640
words, knowledge, indeed, transferred onto a tape and it's an energetic transfer as

168
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
opposed to a physical one.

169
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,720
But it does create a physical result when it's turned back around and played out through

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,260
a speaker, which, you know, creates that analog and is analog.

171
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah.

172
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,840
OK.

173
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,040
Yeah.

174
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,980
Now, what I'm going to be discussing, take a minute, sit back.

175
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,080
And this is going to be with the effects of subtle energies.

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,480
Now, there's subtle energies that have subtle results.

177
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,760
Most things, by the way, that you see on the stupid rectangle that they call so energies

178
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,120
have no results because it's put out by the, you know, the community to keep people busy.

179
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,120
But in subtle energies, you have weak results and strong results.

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,880
This is somewhere between weak and strong.

181
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,740
And this is what this might sound very base and rudimentary.

182
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,120
No pun intended about it being noble and base.

183
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,740
But the effects of location within an environment, like we said earlier, burying it in the ground

184
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,480
on the surface of the ground or up high off the ground, how high that can be, you determine

185
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:50,840
what you normally would have access to, let's say temperature effects of other living and

186
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,600
nonliving things in the area can change things.

187
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,300
Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,080
We know that Greek.

189
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,380
OK.

190
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,220
What I mean is by this, for example, I posted some pics, by the way, of the water devices

191
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,180
that I'm trafficking in lately, just in case people are interested or curious, they can't

192
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,040
say, what are you doing?

193
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,540
I just did.

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm not trying to offer them to anyone.

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,380
They're all custom made or whatever.

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,680
But I put some information if anyone is interested.

197
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,420
You never know.

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,700
Right.

199
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,140
You put that in the chat.

201
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,100
What, today?

202
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,620
A few days ago.

203
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,140
A few days ago.

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,540
Sorry.

205
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,460
More than a few days.

206
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,900
But maybe.

207
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,180
Yeah.

208
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,780
So.

209
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,480
So what I've discovered is when I'm working with these materials, let's just go to let's

210
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,059
go forward.

211
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:31,640
Let's go.

212
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,200
The last time we spoke actually going backwards, I said the next project in the near future

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,100
will be not a dissectable capacitor, but a dissectable inductor and how it pertains to

214
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,520
the body, creating and manifesting things by induction, not the way we're told by absorption

215
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,620
in these chemical things.

216
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,220
Right.

217
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,220
But fast forward, for example, the ennoblement of metal, you know, like something like aluminum

218
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,820
that I brought up earlier.

219
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,000
When you work with aluminum, you can basically work with it with basic woodworking tools.

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,540
It's in the twelve hundred to fifteen hundred PSI, which is like the hardness of a hardwood

221
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,800
like white oak or something.

222
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,100
Right.

223
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,840
But don't hold me in the PSI numbers.

224
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,000
It depends on the aluminum.

225
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,320
Right.

226
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,040
Oh, yeah.

227
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,340
Different.

228
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,380
There's there's different qualities of aluminum.

229
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,880
It's fairly malleable.

230
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:21,980
Alloys.

231
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,440
Alloys.

232
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah.

233
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,500
You can do a matrix aluminum, which is harder than steel.

234
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,640
But this is not whatever.

235
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,880
This is sort of the thing I wanted to bring up.

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,960
If you have a piece of aluminum and you keep it at a certain temperature at a certain pressure

237
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,400
and the pressure is air pressure.

238
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,560
When I say bar, that's one bar is one atmosphere.

239
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:38,960
Right.

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,400
And let's say two and a half bar at the temperature of a fever, which is about one hundred eight

241
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,420
degrees for a certain amount of time.

242
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,360
You'll notice that the tools that cut it prior to that treatment will have a very difficult

243
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,000
time, almost not be able to cut it or drill it.

244
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,280
Right.

245
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,660
So you're changing its quality.

246
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,100
But chemically and analytically, it's still pure aluminum.

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,420
But they can achieve something like that, let's say, by adding what's called metal matrix

248
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,440
with ceramic beads in it makes it really hard.

249
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,500
So what I've noticed also working with certain high quality, high grade plastics, I work with

250
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,680
Schedule 80 PVC.

251
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,020
I don't like the PVC, but Schedule 80 is NSF industrial standard.

252
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,500
If you show up anywhere with that in any industry, they respect it.

253
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,720
Right.

254
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,780
And it's also you can get NSF certification, blah, blah, blah.

255
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,140
What I've noticed is what I've been doing to make the pipe malleable to form as it does

256
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,180
is a mixture that an ad hoc mixture that I had here of certain quartz sands and magnetite

257
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,620
and things like that, things like that.

258
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,500
And the magnetite was of a certain quality that I used in a hot form to hot bend the

259
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,520
pipe and form it and have it relax and stay stable in that form.

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,120
And I noticed that if I didn't use that ad hoc mixture that I was using, I had a different

261
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,700
quality in the plastic so much so that if I don't use the mixture that I'm using, the

262
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,420
normal plastic bench acts like normal plastic.

263
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,980
In other words, it's not impervious to solvents.

264
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,780
Right. If you put a strong solvent like acetone, it will melt it or damage it.

265
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,500
It was susceptible to heat changes.

266
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,420
But I noticed when I used the ad hoc mixture that I used to bend the material, it was no

267
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:36,460
longer susceptible to solvents as it was before, and it was much more stable, thermally

268
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,920
stable. You know, that sounds very similar to what they used to do to plastic glasses

269
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,500
frames when they used to use the hot sand in order to reshape it.

270
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,020
And indeed, it became a lot less problematic for, like, say, you sweating into it and all

271
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,500
that, too. That was like this is different.

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,600
Well, both in other words, I've tried both hot sand bending.

273
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,000
The one that uses the ad hoc mixture changes the plastics quality where the regular hot

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
sand did not. Yeah, that was the only reason why I brought it up is that it actually used

275
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,160
to change the quality of the plastic and plastic glasses frames, which actually made it a

276
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,260
little longer. Yeah, which was weird.

277
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm not saying it's anywhere similar.

278
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,560
It just had this added effect that I found interesting that it actually by heating it up,

279
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,580
dipping it in sand, hot sand, basically, which was mixed with some old practice.

280
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,140
But the ad hoc mixture that I'm using, I've done I've gone back and forth.

281
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,760
I've cut up sections and subjected them to various solvents and with timers.

282
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,240
And, you know, the best science is the stuff you have.

283
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,300
By the way, if you ever watch a YouTube video or something like that with a scientist as

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,420
well, we discovered this using some very expensive equipment.

285
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,480
They're bullshitting. They're trying to get you away from being inquisitive and handing

286
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
over all your cognitive beliefs to them.

287
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,580
Like I've always said, if you can't do it in your kitchen or living room table or in

288
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,900
your backyard, it's bullshit.

289
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,780
Right. Even nuclear stuff.

290
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,660
And I don't want to get into that because I have had conversations with people that

291
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,760
worked with chemists like their parent was a chemist, old school.

292
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,000
And Fourth of July, he'd make sub nuclear reactive fireworks.

293
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Like instead of the regular chemical fireworks, he would make small nukes.

294
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,940
Imagine. Right. So and in his in his basement.

295
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,800
So this all this stuff that you hear about it, there's a video, the nuclear scare

296
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,440
scam. I forgot the guy's name, talked about why nuclear material is so expensive.

297
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,240
It's part of the security apparatus.

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,820
The reason they did that. Well, they tell you nuclear material is dangerous.

299
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,700
It's part of a security apparatus.

300
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,040
So when people walk near, they say, oh, it's radioactive.

301
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,900
Leave it alone because it's a million dollars an ounce.

302
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,020
Right. Well, look, it's also it's also a solid strategy by people that corner markets

303
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,360
and control things. If you make something super expensive, it becomes difficult for the

304
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,740
common person to acquire it.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,860
Just in general, it doesn't even matter if it's actually dangerous.

306
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,700
It actually matters that it's difficult for most people to acquire it.

307
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,000
I mean, if I tell anybody listening, they ended up being an expensive process, which

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,240
it became cheaper, by the way, but it was still around a million dollars an ounce.

309
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,560
Yeah. And they and they figured the it would get even more expensive to build a security

310
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,880
apparatus. So one guy had the idea or maybe a group had a think tank.

311
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,960
Why don't we tell people it's extremely radioactive and hazardous and they will stay

312
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,560
away from it? Well, in fact, it's not expensive and difficult to work.

313
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,780
That my point is, if it's expensive and difficult to work with altogether, whether by

314
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,800
legend or by truth, and it is just difficult to acquire monetarily, the majority of

315
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,480
people that you and I would encounter are not going to ever be able to touch it or

316
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,920
get near it because they want to steal it.

317
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,640
The access, of course, they would want to steal it.

318
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,060
But the access is denied.

319
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,020
And if they try to steal it, well, you better know how to steal it safely.

320
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,760
Otherwise you're going to say that's the whole scam.

321
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,020
Hold on. Hold on. Slow down.

322
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,840
Rewind. What I'm saying is there is no danger with these materials.

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
Yes, there is. They get hot when you get over critical mass.

324
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,460
No, my point was that you make you make this the common idea and you make this a

325
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,600
common danger with acquiring it, because that way it reduces the amount of people

326
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
that will even attempt to acquire it.

327
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,220
And there you go.

328
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,240
And even if you wanted to steal it, you don't want to steal it because.

329
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Hold on. Slow down, slow down, Chuck.

330
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,840
Too much coffee, maybe.

331
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,020
I don't know, because my case is always too much coffee.

332
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,040
If I don't have coffee and cigarettes, I can't do anything.

333
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,860
But anyway, the case ended up being the first amount that they ever

334
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,240
produced, the Americans at least, was a billion an ounce in today's money.

335
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,680
But then they got a little smarter at it and it ended up being in the million an

336
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,880
ounce. And then, of course, it's how do we keep it secure?

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,700
Because obviously people would want to try to steal it.

338
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,220
Let's just tell them that it's dangerous.

339
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,340
And now it doesn't end up being on the list of thieves, right, that want it.

340
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,580
And that's a scam. Right.

341
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,260
But it's OK, because you're not going to do much with it anyway.

342
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,020
You can make your own. Oh, my gosh.

343
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,260
What's he talking about? All right.

344
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,160
So let's get off of that.

345
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,140
What I want to say is that the ennoblement of material is something that is way out

346
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,900
of the people's nomenclature in their language.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,180
In other words, when they talk about things, the most they're going to actually

348
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,040
say is, oh, keep it in the fridge.

349
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,460
So it's fresher. Right.

350
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,520
When you get some food or something, right.

351
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,160
Keep it. And you have like certain things of paints and glues.

352
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
They have what's called a pot life.

353
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,920
You know, once you open it, it's only good for a certain amount of time.

354
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,000
You have a you buy a tube of glue and you open it and use a little bit.

355
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,160
And a few years later, you're like, oh, I remember I need that glue.

356
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,620
Yeah. I remember that glue you got for this.

357
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,840
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. I have some.

358
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,300
You go in the cabinet, pull it out.

359
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,300
What? Oh, it's dry. It's no good anymore.

360
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,860
Right. So pot life is over.

361
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,640
OK, so you have these common things that people interact with all the time.

362
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,500
And the most that they ever see in their vernacular is, oh, if you don't put it in

363
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,200
the fridge, it's going to spoil.

364
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,640
There's very little emphasis on ennobling something, keeping it, you know, to a

365
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,240
certain degree, even woodworkers.

366
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,599
OK, for example, if you buy, let's say, hardwood flooring, you cannot install it

367
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,060
until the wood or should not reach a certain moisture content.

368
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,720
If you install it when the moisture content is above five percent or so.

369
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Now, what a nice floor. Two weeks later, you got quarter inch gaps everywhere

370
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,420
because the wood shrunk. Right.

371
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,200
If you go to a good construction site, they usually stack the wood in there for a

372
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,460
couple of weeks or they have a moisture test before they install it.

373
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,340
Not anymore with the synthetic material so much.

374
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,280
So that is that's still not what I'm discussing.

375
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,980
There is there's anyone who plays an instrument knows that you shouldn't record

376
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,600
acoustic guitar on a rainy day.

377
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,760
You can never really tune it properly.

378
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,600
Right. So that's true.

379
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,620
And this is what I actually believe it or not.

380
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,340
A lot of guitars don't think that way.

381
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,520
But I'm telling them they notice it sounds like, yeah, why don't you start applying

382
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
it? I always I always check the humidity level because that's what's important.

383
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,680
If the humidity is too high, don't bother because you're not going to consistently

384
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,060
maintain the guitar.

385
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,060
But try to measure try to measure humidity when it's raining.

386
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,060
Yeah. Nearly impossible.

387
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,080
Right. Yeah. Right. Right.

388
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,680
Well, it's it's possible you get you'll get really wide readings and it changes

389
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,280
drastically depending on what floor of the building you're on.

390
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,940
Right. The higher up you go, the more humid it is.

391
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,860
Right. Oh, wait a second.

392
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,620
You know. OK. Anyway, it's another discussion.

393
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,520
So to get off the tangent, there's an ennoblement concept.

394
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,200
The only time you actually see it being used most frequently.

395
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,840
But what I mean by ennobling concept is the combination of certain things in the

396
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,940
environment and other materials to make something of better quality is maybe you'll

397
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,340
see it in the wine industry.

398
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,800
It has really been dumbed down.

399
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,120
Also, I remember speaking to people who were in a legacy of winemaking and

400
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,220
one of the more, let's say, prized wine bottles.

401
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,620
Women were never allowed into the room where the barrels were, because

402
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,620
when a woman a woman is menstruating, she's giving off a certain pheromone

403
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,140
and that pheromone would penetrate and permeate the wood and affect the taste of

404
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,380
the wine. So instead of asking, is

405
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,500
the woman in her cycle, they just prevented any woman from going into the building,

406
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,180
you see. And this is like a level of of, let's

407
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,760
say, critical, you know, let's say not just thinking, but critical level of

408
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,640
operating that you don't you don't see anymore.

409
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,080
It just doesn't exist. Almost, you know, in common.

410
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,900
And it's also dismissed as old fashioned, because, look, you're Greek and I

411
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,580
clearly say to you, I'm Italian.

412
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,780
And we both know that we probably had ancestors who had this idea that you don't

413
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,640
let the women into those rooms at all, because we've known at some point some

414
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,240
ancestor that probably made their own wine and you let them work in

415
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,120
the vats. But that's in open air.

416
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,520
And that way they're not exposed.

417
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,780
And also. Right. But it's a certain level.

418
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,600
But the thing is, it's just a concept.

419
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,040
It really has nothing to do with.

420
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,800
Yeah. But some people think it's just, you know, old fashioned because it's

421
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,580
antiquated based on old ideas.

422
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,240
Specific is that they're trying to get certain analogs here so people can get a

423
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,220
sense of how fine things really do work.

424
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
And the reason what inspired me to bring up the ennoblement is because I am just

425
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,800
completely fascinated by the things that I'm working on now and will be working

426
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,500
on on how subtle the effects of certain things can be.

427
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,220
But the result is not a subtle result.

428
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,820
It's a very strong result.

429
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,680
Right. Another thing I'm going to add, then I want to talk about safety.

430
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,300
Well, subtle is not equivalent to inconsequential.

431
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,040
That's really the case here that you have subtle and weak and subtle and strong

432
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,620
results. You have two different things.

433
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,380
Yes, that's that's the point there.

434
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,620
It's not always a matter of well, subtle just means it's not very important.

435
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,820
It's just a small thing.

436
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,460
Yeah. A small burning ember is very subtle.

437
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,700
Right. But if it's attached to a fuse that lights a powder keg, it's still subtle,

438
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,260
subtle, subtle, subtle, subtle, subtle, subtle until it gets to the powder keg.

439
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,340
And then it's very strong.

440
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,920
You see the same exact ember.

441
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,960
Right. So this is somewhere in between just an ember and a powder keg.

442
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,260
What I'm discussing. Another thing when you're dealing with ethereal devices, what

443
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm doing with the water and the weather and other things, this just struck me

444
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,020
recently. That's why it's I find it critical to bring it up to see if it's a wave

445
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,360
coming through where other people might have gotten this download, let's say, or

446
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,760
inspiration of thinking when I work with what I'm working with.

447
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,780
And I consider it to be an ethereal device because I use magnets, but I don't use

448
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,320
magnetism. In other words, the device has magnets, but it does not use magnetism.

449
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Right. It's kind of, oh, well, then why would you use them if they don't understand?

450
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,320
Right. So it's kind of like the way we society uses fire.

451
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
You use fire, but you're not using the fire on your you say you're staying away

452
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,900
from it. You're having to do its thing in a way that it's very isolated.

453
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,100
OK. What I want to bring up is when you're working with ethereal objects, in

454
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,640
other words, when you're accessing the resultant factor of what we know about the

455
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
ether, mass matters.

456
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,000
In other words, the when I'm working with the water, the mass of the actual

457
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,140
center of the piece makes a difference in the end result.

458
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,400
When I'm working with, let's say, the weather, the actual mass of water and the

459
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,120
size of the weather gun actually makes a difference as well.

460
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,740
So it's but it's not either way.

461
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,140
You only see the difference that the increased mass makes in the result, not in

462
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,620
not like having a small cap gun versus, you know, a 50 caliber gun, the kick, you

463
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,180
know, if you shoot a larger caliber pistol, it has much more of a kickback or

464
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,020
flyback. Right.

465
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,480
Not like that at all.

466
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,060
It's there's no direct correlation, but the direct correlation comes in the end

467
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,780
result. That's why it's very difficult for people to

468
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,900
understand working with these ethereal devices, because they're used to immediate

469
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,100
results. Like if you have a small hedge trimmer, right, and then someone there has

470
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,820
a three foot still chainsaw, right, and you go about cutting the same things, there's

471
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,100
a huge difference. But, you know, the reaction you're going to get from anyone

472
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,900
watching the big chainsaw go versus a little hedge trimmer.

473
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,860
Right. So this is the way we've been trained.

474
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,660
But I'm I'm saying that whether it's a hedge trimmer or a chainsaw in the

475
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,220
ethereal, they're both going to be absolutely silent and it'll look like neither

476
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,400
of them is doing anything until the job is done.

477
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,780
So this is this is how the ennoblement works.

478
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,380
Just to maybe slightly finish this off, if anyone's ever gone into what's called

479
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,680
hard rock mines where you find gold, most gold is found by creeks, rivers and

480
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,880
placer, you know, nuggets that are worn out.

481
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,700
But if you go into a hard rock situation where there's like a mile hole, a mile

482
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,980
long, deep hole in a mountain where you're you go in to see the gold inside the

483
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,940
mountain rock. Right.

484
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,260
It's called hard rock mining.

485
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,760
Let's say you will see quartz formations and the usually the gold is forming through

486
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,880
the quartz as if it flew ahead.

487
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,340
Like it was a fluid at one point and help and grew with the crystal.

488
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,940
Right. So that could be a rather quick process.

489
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,940
In other words, that process could just take a few decades where the scientists will

490
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,360
tell you, well, that takes millions and millions of years.

491
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,720
It doesn't. So that's what I mean by, again, it's very, very subtle.

492
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,560
You can look at a mountain. It doesn't look like anything's going on.

493
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,280
But if you've been in a hard rock mine and you've seen a virgin gold vein, you'll

494
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,560
see the quartz, you'll see the gold.

495
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,700
Depending on the gold vein, there are many types, but I have seen that.

496
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,480
And it's interesting when you see it, it's all organic, all of it.

497
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:03,000
Even the minerals have organic outlays or, you know, the the archetype of or of how

498
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,620
things grow. So with that said, I want to get into safety.

499
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,480
What I mean by safety, not the way that you might think that word means safety

500
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,200
pertaining to Greek speak and other utterings of similar reprisal.

501
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,340
What did he just say? OK, meaning going against right to a degree.

502
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,600
When you hear Greek speak, it's very different than normal speak.

503
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,500
And many people, this is a safety now, many people will take to it on a list on a

504
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,440
hearing basis. They'll hear it.

505
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:51,360
And very rarely have I ever been, let's say, challenged or negated or whatever.

506
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,920
Or, you know, other people have for some reason in public or speaking with a

507
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,780
stranger or whatever.

508
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,680
I've heard some academics say, well, I don't know what you're talking about.

509
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,780
I have I only like conversations that are linear, you know, like one thing at a

510
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,280
time. Right. So I've heard that and various other stupid remarks.

511
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,600
It seems like the more education they have, the dumber they their remarks are.

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,180
So what I mean by safety is what happens is when you bring up Greek speak

513
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:28,920
utterings, people very rarely see any reason to divert or negate or disagree

514
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,000
with very rarely.

515
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,480
You might have some disagreement here, but it's very superficial because, you

516
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,300
know, if the cognitive dissonance thing.

517
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,900
Right. We're talking about basic, basic things.

518
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,520
Right. Now, what happens?

519
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,600
This is what I mean by safety and why the Greek speak does not work on the mass

520
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,340
collective and why it is a unique factor, like a very, very unique factor in one's

521
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,880
thinking and one's ability to even think about or discuss it.

522
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,440
There's this thing I call safety.

523
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,840
What happens is you approach an individual and you bring up something that's in

524
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,040
Greek speak, or let's say I'll speak from the first person, right, or a third

525
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,420
person like I like to.

526
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,180
So you discuss certain things, whether it's about the character of the person or

527
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,320
society or religious beliefs.

528
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,660
Or did you know, you know, very basic stuff, you know, we're not talking about

529
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,420
like, I read a book and I found this out.

530
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,120
You should never notice like, you know, the days of the week, you know, how to

531
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,920
keep time, anything, anything, even superficial approach.

532
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,280
For example, you can absolutely destroy any religion with a superficial approach

533
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,520
of what's in the text that they're supposed to subscribe to very easily.

534
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,620
So all these very simple things.

535
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,540
I recently took a shot at induction just trying to introduce that idea to somebody.

536
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
You know, yeah, go ahead.

537
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,460
Yeah, you have to do it in a way, though, that is personable to the person's what

538
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,100
they expect to hear on such a conversation.

539
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
Maybe I'll talk about that.

540
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,260
So even what I do is when you bring up anything outside of the, quote, unquote,

541
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:09,060
normal collective vernacular, it should be done in a way where the conversation has

542
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,380
the the cadence and the and the intensity that they normally would hear as if they

543
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,460
were watching it on television, right?

544
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,260
Or something benign, you know, even though they try to if you watch the history

545
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,600
channel, such garbage, all of it, not some of it on how they try to dramatize things.

546
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,780
I'm like, why are they putting dramatic music behind something that this that

547
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,760
they're saying is a blatant lie or totally stupid?

548
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,300
It's because it's the music, the background music that affects the mind more than what

549
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,260
they're saying. You see?

550
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,880
So that's what I mean.

551
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,340
It's the casualness.

552
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,000
Sometimes it doesn't have to be casual.

553
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,600
That's why rather subtle soundtracks, not just with music, but with sound effects as

554
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,300
well, are often piped in there.

555
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
And you're not really hearing it.

556
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,480
You know, it's not the first thing that comes to mind.

557
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,820
You're listening to the words, you're watching the image and you think that's what

558
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,620
you're focusing on.

559
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Well, yeah, the early TV research, they found that after 20 minutes of watching TV,

560
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,540
almost everyone goes into alpha wave status and that alpha wave, you're very the brain,

561
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
right? It's very suggestive, suggestive.

562
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,540
And by the way, early studies on the brain in the early 20th century, what they came up

563
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,860
with was that most of the brain, except for the front of the brain, is is set up to to

564
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,240
believe and accept everything that it sees or hears.

565
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,080
It's only the front part of the brain and not the left or right, but the very front that

566
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,300
has the ability to discern.

567
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,380
So they know how to deal with that because it's on the front.

568
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,140
They could pulse it with low frequencies and like we're talking about.

569
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,800
And now pretty much everybody believes everything they hear and see.

570
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,980
Right. So but anyway, to go back to it.

571
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,600
So once you have a certain relaxed way, you know, not getting up into someone's face,

572
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,340
people are very agreeable, I find.

573
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,680
Right. But the reason why it's never for the general public or 99 percent of people you'll

574
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,040
ever mention anything about Greek speak to is because of safety.

575
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,860
What do I mean about that?

576
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,640
OK, bring me talking about safety.

577
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,140
It doesn't say anything about safety yet.

578
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,820
Yep. Still waiting on that real definition there.

579
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,180
Yeah. Yeah. Very simple.

580
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,200
This is specific to Greek speak, because no matter how much they like or don't like what

581
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,120
you say, how jarred they are by it or let's say unaffected or whatever.

582
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,640
One of the things that they do understand, and I do bring this up is you've probably

583
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,800
never heard this before. And now I finished up and say you'll probably never hear it

584
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,040
again from anyone else.

585
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,800
And they usually agree.

586
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,000
The safety part is this.

587
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,420
They know that because they never heard it from anyone else and probably won't hear it

588
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,780
from anyone else again when they go out into the world, into the collective, whether

589
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,980
it's people on the street where they live, their family, their workers, where no one

590
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,080
will ever go down such a path and bring up anything like that ever again, most likely

591
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,540
so they can listen to what you're saying, you know, the Greek speak to a point.

592
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,340
But they know that once they depart from your presence, even earshot, they are

593
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,160
completely safe because everything around them goes back to how it was before.

594
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,180
Right. And there's no reason.

595
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,080
So there's no they. In other words, they kind of know consciously that even if

596
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,340
something they hear in Greek speak really jars them down to the core, it makes them

597
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,220
uneasy. There is an intuitive part that they know that once they leave the presence

598
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,740
of whoever speaking the Greek speak, they will be safe again because no one else ever

599
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,060
brings anything like this up.

600
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
That's what I mean by safety.

601
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:31,180
And that's why the normies, the collective, whatever the people that are spiritually

602
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,980
lazy or whatever, listen to the Greek speak and, quote unquote, put up with it if it

603
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,060
makes them uneasy, because they know the moment they leave that the presence of

604
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,680
whoever is uttering these things, they are going to be completely safe.

605
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,100
So in plain speak, it would be that they're just simply not worried about getting

606
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,220
confronted with it again anytime soon.

607
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,440
So therefore, it's OK.

608
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,740
Well, yeah. And that is why they will never accept it in other or do anything with it.

609
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,360
So because of its rarity, basically, because they're not going to have to hear it

610
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,780
again because they won't hear it from somebody else.

611
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,880
That's that safety.

612
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,260
I don't think there's anything rare about it because ninety nine percent of the Greek

613
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,660
speak stuff is bringing forward what's already in front of everyone.

614
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,640
Well, yeah, but it's rare that somebody actually does that.

615
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,860
Yeah, right. So I don't think it's rarity.

616
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,100
I think what it is is, again, safety.

617
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,560
There's they can be uncomfortable with while they're listening as much as they feel

618
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,740
uncomfortable because they know the moment they depart, they will be safe again forever.

619
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:43,220
Well, OK, I I'm trying to wrap my mind around this because to me, it seems

620
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,520
it seems odd, but it's it's almost like since I since I won't ever see this again,

621
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,920
that actually explains a few other things.

622
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,040
I see where, you know, people talk about how could you possibly ignore this thing over

623
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,280
here? It is because they know they're not going to have to deal with that again.

624
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,360
I think that does change the reaction.

625
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,620
I think when they when they this is deep, deep psychological overview here.

626
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah, because it doesn't have to be Greek speak, by the way.

627
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,640
Most of the things that disturb another person when they're confronted with something

628
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,660
that is disturbing is because what is it always boiled down to?

629
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,920
You can hear it in their own language.

630
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,440
They'll tell you, well, I never want to have to go through that, even if they just

631
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,860
heard about something terrible.

632
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,680
Let's just say take anything.

633
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,840
You read a terrible headline in the news.

634
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,060
You know, the old jokes. There's some people that just come up to you and begin a

635
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,440
conversation with. Did you see that there were five murders yesterday?

636
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,780
You know, and you go, well, that's still part of the collective.

637
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,360
The whole thing is, OK, with this is one thing that I try to discern with people.

638
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,840
Well, yeah, especially with Greek speak before.

639
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,960
So tell me something that you've heard on TV, church radio that was not a lie.

640
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,260
In other words, and that kind of thing, what you know, because I know what they're

641
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,140
thinking. Right. So and I'll tell you what they're thinking, but something that's not

642
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,140
a lie. In other words, and then I say, well, in other words, give me tell me a media

643
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,699
story or a religious story or some story you've heard that is not a lie

644
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,219
from any of those groups that I met.

645
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,400
And then one person will say, oh, yeah, there was an accident on I-10.

646
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,580
A truck overturned yesterday.

647
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,040
Was that a lie to Greek?

648
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,980
And I'm like, no, I said story.

649
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,360
That's a report they can.

650
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,440
I'm telling you, CNN could come here right now or your priest and tell you this is a

651
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,679
stop sign, which we're standing in front of right now.

652
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,260
He's not lying because he's just reporting what you see and anybody can see.

653
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,739
But I'm talking about when they start giving you stories, they're all lies, all of

654
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,500
them. Right.

655
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,500
So now they start to discern the difference between a report and a story.

656
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,980
They say it all the time. They discern it on their own.

657
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,520
They tell you this is a story and this is a report.

658
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,179
They listen carefully.

659
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,180
Right. So and the other thing is people are getting wound up because they're being

660
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,460
distracted because the cataclysms that are coming are cataclysms that have not

661
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,620
happened in over 6000 years.

662
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,580
Right. So so you have to distract the people because when when you have something

663
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,800
that is so monumental, let's say even one percent of the population getting a

664
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,060
handle on it is way too much.

665
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,740
You have to keep it like below a thousandth of a percent right to guarantee some

666
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,600
kind of a way you can have a clean escape.

667
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,300
Right. Because they're not they have no duty, no authority.

668
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,360
Whether it's religious, governmental or whatever, has any authority to protect any

669
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,080
duty to protect anyone.

670
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,740
Right. As a matter of fact, they do the opposite.

671
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,860
Well, this is how I explain the JFK thing when people go, well, how come you guys

672
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,680
haven't made this kind of progress or that kind of progress with this or that?

673
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,500
And I go, because there's only about a thousand of us that actually do any of the

674
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,120
work. And you don't understand that a thousand people is inconsequential.

675
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,820
Right. As long as the numbers are very, very small.

676
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,360
They see. OK, if the numbers are not small, yes, there could be obstacles.

677
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,820
Right. They're just they don't view you as resistance at all because they have enough

678
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,600
ordinance to kill everyone five times over.

679
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,420
They don't care about that. And there's enough dumb people to do that.

680
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,680
Right. So for them.

681
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,400
So what I mean by it is the distractions are going to be increasing more.

682
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,160
So even if someone like me who completely ignores everything in the media, it's like I

683
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,220
don't even want to know who the president is because it's all a joke anyway.

684
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,560
Right. But I do find out eventually like the Maui fires.

685
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,260
I didn't know anything about the Maui fires.

686
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,180
I still don't know anything. But I could tell you exactly what went down based on the

687
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,760
previous playbook. Right.

688
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,320
All the conspiracies. And it was for knowledge.

689
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,880
And I don't even know. I mean, am I used to tell me, you know, it was for knowledge.

690
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,100
The government's in on it for as a land grab.

691
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,560
A whole bunch of people died. No one knows why.

692
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,660
Why did metal burn and plastic didn't.

693
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,620
Why did certain houses burn and others didn't.

694
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,760
Right. But that's what.

695
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,900
Right. And I haven't looked at a damn thing about the Maui fires, except maybe two

696
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,060
titles and you bringing it up and someone else bringing.

697
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,220
No, I know you haven't.

698
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,400
And yet you're you're calling exactly what the discussion is.

699
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,120
And yeah. Yeah, exactly.

700
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,260
So the same with politics.

701
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,800
You half of it is blame the people that came before you.

702
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,460
The other half is blame that you're not getting cooperation.

703
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,480
And the other half is you're a victim.

704
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,080
So anyway, what I'm saying is, as we get closer to time that's coming,

705
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,540
there's going to be more and more and more distraction about, you know, look at each

706
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,220
other and starting fights.

707
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,540
So what I'm trying to say, I brought this up in terms of safety, because part of the

708
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,700
safety mechanism that people enjoy when, in other words, if you confront anyone with

709
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,280
Greek speak, they will depends on who it is.

710
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,400
Some people, I suggest, don't do it if you're not a good communicator.

711
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,140
Don't even bother because you're going to jumble it and it's going to sound offensive.

712
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,200
So what I would suggest is if you if you start bringing up certain things that have

713
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,780
nothing to do with left or right or any other paradigms, people put up with it because

714
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,820
they know that once they leave your presence, there's going to be a safe haven with their

715
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,500
family, their co-workers at the bus stop, whatever, because everyone else is in the

716
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,640
collective. So that is the thing that will start falling apart because those people are

717
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,040
going to be pit against each other.

718
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,220
Right. And that doesn't mean that they're going to come back and listen to the higher

719
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,320
order of things. Yes.

720
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,300
Greek speak is definitely higher order of things because it's not like higher order.

721
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,900
You got to go to the top of the mountain.

722
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,260
It's because it's stuff that's right in front of you that you should know.

723
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,860
By the way, there's an old Chinese saying about there are many paths to the top of the

724
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,420
mountain. But once you get there, the view is always the same.

725
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,980
Right. Yeah.

726
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,840
So look, as we draw to the end of the time, you allotted for me for today, I have just

727
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,740
a quick question. Are we trying to say that instead of their safety in numbers, there

728
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,100
seems to be safety in ignorance?

729
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,640
Because. Absolutely.

730
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,100
Yeah. Like, for example, if I'm around a bunch of people that think like the collective,

731
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,580
I don't feel safe at all.

732
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
To me, that's dangerous, right?

733
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,780
Because they could be set off in any minute.

734
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
You know, it comes on television.

735
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,820
Anyone with a blue cap should be killed.

736
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,440
They'll do it. There'll be a certain amount of them that will do it.

737
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,060
Yeah. But again, instead of years ago, I used to knock people more than I do now.

738
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,660
And now I just study them like animals, just like you would go on a wildlife excursion.
