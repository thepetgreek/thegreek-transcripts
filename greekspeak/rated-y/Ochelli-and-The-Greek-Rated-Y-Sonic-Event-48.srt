1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,440
I have a couple of thoughts at the beginning here and I'll try and shut up and get out

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,540
of the way as fast as possible.

3
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,040
Because I think I'm going to have to this time.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,420
You know, Greg, how are you doing, first of all?

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,620
You're outside tonight.

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,960
So maybe we'll get a different type of feel.

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,180
Yeah, I'm out here by the patio garden slash cat area slash work area slash all that.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,980
Yeah, before we started recording, you asked me when we ended the last time, you got some

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,220
more you want to talk about.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,020
You brought that up.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,920
And I was like, you know, I forgot.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,340
Right.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,600
Well, it's kind of funny because you were like, look, I got a whole bunch of stuff on

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,960
my mind.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,860
But I don't have time right now.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,340
I got to go.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
And you were like, really in a hurry.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,360
And I was like, OK, cool.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:00,800
Yeah.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Great.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,200
That's that's what happens lately after me.

22
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:08,040
The past six months, let's say, were really nothing to do with what we're doing.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,520
And no, no, it's actually the water projects and other things that are just right.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,680
Well, you and I only do this a couple of times a week.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:16,900
Right.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,480
So, I mean, the thing is, we have we have other things to go on during the week, during

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,620
the time in between.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,180
And look, I get it.

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,780
But it's really funny to me because I never think of you as a guy who wouldn't keep something

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,600
in your memory because you have this astounding memory for certain things and certain things.

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,060
Yeah.

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,680
Well, you notice I did say.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,340
And I have odd memories for certain things as well.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,060
Like I remember fragments of conversations, like literally like as if I recorded them

35
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,440
sometimes.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,820
I don't know why that is.

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,660
I don't know why.

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,800
It seems that different people are equipped differently.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,380
Different people train themselves differently in memory in and of itself is kind of a fascinating

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,460
aspect to this.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,520
Well, let's just call it the creature I'm inhabiting at the moment, because as far as

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,240
I can tell, I'm one of these human things here on the surface of this rock.

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,480
And I got to say, it's one of those aspects that everybody talks about.

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,080
Everybody mentions, you know, from from the dumbest, dullard possible to the most intelligent

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,520
person.

46
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,700
They always go to their memory.

47
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
They always talk about memory.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,540
Everything, you know, really revolves around memory when it comes to conversation.

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,860
What information you retain, what it is you're able to do with things.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Do you remember?

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,960
Do you remember whether it's emotional, too?

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,900
That's another thing.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,540
Also, is it worth remembering?

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,060
Well, there you go.

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
And can you remember everything?

56
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,460
Like when people say to me, well, this is actually hold on.

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,420
Yeah, you do.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,640
You actually do.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,020
That's the crazy part.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,020
Everything is recorded because it's a tiny fraction of one's ability.

61
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,100
Well, and even physiologically, there is the difference between the endemic memory and

62
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,940
the other one.

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,220
Right.

64
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,940
So you have one that you can recall.

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,320
And then you have another psychologist, the academic, because it doesn't work that way.

66
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,100
Well, I'm not bringing the academic in.

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,460
I am.

68
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,820
I'm only bringing something that I was able to observe.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,040
Everybody else is non-academic.

70
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,240
Yeah.

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,700
No, no.

72
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,860
This is not the way an academic is going to describe this, I'm sure, because I've gone

73
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,520
through that stuff.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
I've read that stuff.

75
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,360
And it's foolishness.

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
It's really foolish.

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,420
But one thing they do kind of have right, but I'm not referring to them.

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm going on observations here is, you know, we have memories that started like if you

79
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
think back, what is the first thing that you can recall?

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,300
You're not going to recall your birth.

81
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:34,960
No, I don't.

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,220
I mean, you know, some people, by the way, but but it'll be extremely difficult because

83
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,160
your physiology, that is that memories from that point of your life.

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,720
Right.

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Until about three or four is super reliant on your physiology.

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,340
What do I mean by physiology?

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,240
Well, you're small, you're underdeveloped.

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,520
You're very flexible, very fluid, both in the descriptive mechanical fluidity sense

89
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,380
and in the chemical fluidity sense.

90
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,620
Right.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,480
So, well, as a creature, we're still sort of incomplete there.

92
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,160
Now, here's where I do agree with the academics and maybe you could correct what I was going

93
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,800
I just finished off the thought is this is where the ham radio guys come in, OK, because

94
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,720
the ham radio guys know all about, you know, antennas, you know, sizes and measurements

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,620
and frequencies.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Right.

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,100
So it's not that we forgot.

98
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,840
It's just that we are in such a radically different body, but it can be tuned in.

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,380
We'll talk about more of that in the future as I'm making more discoveries as we go along

100
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,120
on, you know, what I'm working on.

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
So well, the fact is, without adjustments, you can't take an FM radio and say, pull in

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,220
radio free Sweden, you know, not so easily with the standard construct.

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,640
You have to make some, you know, adjustments to receiver, don't you?

104
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,400
That's another that's a simple discussion.

105
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,980
You'll have more efficient radio transfer if you learn to build radios to transmit and

106
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,960
receive through the ground and not the air.

107
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:57,800
Yeah.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
It's a big mistake.

109
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,060
Yeah.

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,920
Eric, look up Eric Dollard stuff.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
You could find it.

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,520
I haven't found too much of it where you can pick up any radio station anywhere in the

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,280
world at any time.

114
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,000
If you design the device to do so through the earth, not the air, which makes more sense

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,880
because the one thing that is always common, OK, because it doesn't have constant rushing

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,520
storms changing it and things like that has nothing to do with that.

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,980
It's actually a non material phenomenon.

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,340
Real quick, everything in nature wants to form a sphere.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,780
Why?

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,360
Because the sphere is the smallest surface area to to close the volume.

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,540
Right.

122
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,580
So you might think a cube is, but a cube has more surface area than a sphere.

123
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,500
Right.

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,720
And this but the sphere will end up with a smaller volume ultimately.

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,800
But it is this the smallest ratio of surface area to volume to on that for a while.

126
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,520
What does that have to do?

127
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,300
What we're talking about?

128
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,640
But good.

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,580
No, I got it.

130
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,080
You know what?

131
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,760
You have something where you have an equivalent ratio going in all directions with a sphere.

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,740
So it makes sense.

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,440
Yeah.

134
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Twenty two over seven is the ratio generally.

135
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,360
But no one could figure that out.

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,540
Well, I can see it.

137
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,660
I don't know how to articulate it, but I can see it in my mind, which is interesting, too,

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,200
because it almost seems to come from some other memory back to the memory.

139
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,380
Right.

140
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,840
So, look, you start out with a different body.

141
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,020
You can't argue that because we're not like horses.

142
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,740
We don't get right up and are able to walk.

143
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,440
It's not something that happens automatically.

144
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,360
I, you know, I have raised a few children and know what what condition they are when

145
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,360
they come in the world from a different, you know, from an adult perspective, not just

146
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,800
my own.

147
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,080
Right.

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
They're not quite complete.

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,940
I think their wiring is not quite all the way set up just yet.

150
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

151
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
It is for that society.

152
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,940
I was at a I was at a house when I was peddling, trafficking in high end water.

153
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,320
And it was one of these split levels at the boo.

154
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,880
The boo is what Malibu is called, right?

155
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,460
Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,260
Is this when you were selling the twenty dollar bottles?

157
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,420
Yeah.

158
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:02,820
Yeah.

159
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,120
Right.

160
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,460
OK.

161
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,100
Spring water basically reprocessing tap water into spring water.

162
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,840
And it was going against the best spring waters in the world and matching it.

163
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,120
So, of course, I just try to it was it was I think at that time I was the only one in

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,180
the world that actually reproduced Victor Sharpe of his device.

165
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,240
And that's a great that that would be a good little book, you know, like a hundred page

166
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,460
hundred twenty page book novella.

167
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,540
But anyway, we were at a house.

168
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,200
You drive up, it looks like one level, but the back of the house is three floors.

169
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,680
You know, it's built on a hillside.

170
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,140
Daryl Hannah and a couple of other people were there.

171
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,200
Some of the David Wolf, the guy that's into health food and avocado boy.

172
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,740
And oh, you don't you don't mean the TV guy.

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,320
You mean the the health guy?

174
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,660
Yeah. A whole bunch of other people.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,480
There were some TV people that movie people.

176
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,740
So anyway, bored out of my mind and as one would describe it, even though I wasn't

177
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,600
bored, but on the ground level sliding doors where the whole wall opened, there were

178
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,840
like two nannies there and there were about six children and two of them were on the

179
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,660
couch and the rest were on the floor.

180
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,080
And they were all paying attention.

181
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,920
The five of them were paying attention to this one who was doing this elaborate baby

182
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,980
talk. And he finishes the baby talk.

183
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,080
There is a moment of silence and then all the other babies start breaking out into

184
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,460
laughter. And I looked at that and I said, look, he just told a joke.

185
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,480
He just told a joke the way adults do exactly the same way.

186
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
You know, everybody listens to the joke.

187
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,039
Punchline comes moment of silence.

188
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,240
Laughter. Exactly the same way you would direct the film for the cadence of the

189
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,600
interaction. Like, yeah, like in Goodfellas, you know, when someone cracks a joke and

190
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
then everybody laughs, right?

191
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,880
Right. Or something. He was choreographed.

192
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
It didn't look. It was so surreal.

193
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,020
And I was like, so I was like, look, this baby just cracked a joke and baby talk and

194
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,500
it was complicated and they all got it and they all laughed and they thought it was

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,460
good. How come we didn't understand a word of it?

196
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,680
Right. That's a very good question.

197
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,520
Yeah. You see. So they have their own culture and their own society pre downloaded

198
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,440
because remember. I talk about everything is not downloaded, but there's a small

199
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,260
exception in the baby talk world.

200
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,440
Right. Where it is pre downloaded, you know, to a degree.

201
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,960
Well, enough to the degree that I just explained what I saw.

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Well, now, you know, maybe I'm imagining things, but I need you to.

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,040
Yeah, I need you to bridge something here then, because I get what you're saying.

204
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,500
And I it's hard for me to understand this because I don't have a memory of it.

205
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,500
I've never observed it, but I believe you.

206
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,860
Here's the thing, though. I take note all the time that there are people that seem to

207
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,580
have preloaded talents.

208
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,000
They take to things very easily.

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,040
It's just it's you know, like you have a bunch of things that you're able to do that.

210
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,800
It seems to me like I don't think all of it was what you learned.

211
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,260
Some of it seemed to be what some people call intuitive external.

212
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,060
It's all external. It's all external.

213
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,120
But some people receive more than others.

214
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,700
I'm just saying, like, you ever know a guy like, OK, for instance, Randy Rhodes, who was

215
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,620
an excellent guitar player.

216
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,900
It's said that he only took nine months of guitar lessons.

217
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,420
Now, there are people that study five, six, 10 years and never achieve any of the

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
sophistication that this guy was able to get at.

219
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,880
Right. And you'll see people like this.

220
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,180
Some people are just talented when it comes to certain things and everybody's a little

221
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,680
different. Well, hold on.

222
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,120
There's two things going on there.

223
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,820
That's one thing is if you do a tutelage under a master and you ask him, show me, he's

224
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,920
going to kick you out the door.

225
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,860
In other words, if you ask him, give me a lesson.

226
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,520
Sorry. If you ask him, give me a lesson on this, he's going to throw you out.

227
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,860
But if you ask him, tell him, show me, he'll be glad to do it.

228
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,920
OK, when you are working under a master, I'm not talking about like a bullshit

229
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,580
apprenticeship that, you know, whatever some whatever someone that says they're good at

230
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,120
whatever, but a true master like the kind you see memorialized in Hollywood movies.

231
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:10,780
Uh, what they do is they teach by having people around them that are astute observers

232
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,360
and learn that way. And what he will do is he'll perform what he's doing.

233
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,820
And it's up to you to learn by watching him in real.

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
How would you say in earnest?

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
In other words, he's not going to pause.

236
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,740
Masters are looking for people to teach that will not allow the interruption of flow of

237
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,480
what they're doing to demonstrate, you know, and what they're demonstrating, because

238
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,080
actually when you are doing something and you want you have apprentices to learn from

239
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:45,960
it, the moment you stop, begin to pause to explain, you have you have diminished the

240
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,100
entire performance. You've taken away the flow because there are small little fine

241
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,120
things that are done in time.

242
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,280
So this whole thing about, OK, this is how we build this and we show this.

243
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,420
Any questions? This is how we build the next part.

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,100
No, no, no. Doesn't work because the pauses break up the flow.

245
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,440
There's a rhythm, there's a flow, just like instruments.

246
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,480
Right. So what I'm trying to suggest here is what I always tell people.

247
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,880
Recently, I brought up someone that, you know, when you cook poultry, use lavender and

248
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,060
sage. Right. Still, she goes, oh, I learned about that.

249
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,160
So you learned about it.

250
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,520
Yeah. I took a cooking class.

251
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,980
I said, from where? From a chef said, oh, that doesn't mean anything.

252
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,740
She says, why? Because anyone who goes to a good chef school does not say I'm going to

253
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,340
a good chef school, paying all this tuition and time so I could cook to do cooking

254
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,040
classes. What they want to do is work in a restaurant, get their own restaurant, have a

255
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,200
partnership. Right. But if they fail at that, guess what?

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,680
They default to so teaching.

257
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,540
So I said, you actually learn from a failed chef.

258
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,140
Mm hmm. You see.

259
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,300
So the same with judges.

260
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,820
No one goes to law school saying I want to be a judge.

261
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
They want to be a partner in a law firm and make one hundred twenty thousand a month.

262
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,520
Pretty much, you know, feeling important.

263
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,320
Well, it stands the same with a guitar teacher, too, by the way.

264
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,980
You're not learning from the greatest guitarist.

265
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,140
You're learning from you failed, probably trying to be a rock star.

266
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
That's what his intent was.

267
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,640
And now he's trying to make a living.

268
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,680
If you can't be a partner in a law firm, you default as a judge.

269
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,240
So you go in front of a judge. It doesn't matter if it's the Supreme Court.

270
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,460
It's a failed lawyer.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,900
So what I mean by this is things are not taught the way people are taught, the way

272
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,940
things are taught. Say that three times fast.

273
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,280
In other words, people that learn by watch being there and expect.

274
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,900
All right. How many times have you heard someone come into a situation and say, I

275
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,080
can do that. I have a lot of experience in that.

276
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,800
They don't say I got lessons in that.

277
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,340
Who would you trust more?

278
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,440
The one who said I have experience, the one who says they did that, well, the one

279
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,000
who did it and the one that I'm certain did it.

280
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,120
Yes. Yeah.

281
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,340
OK, so this goes back to the memory because they really don't teach.

282
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,480
They teach you how to memorize in a poor way.

283
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,720
So just to go forward, you're saying about instruments and all that.

284
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,020
That's a that's complicated, by the way, because it's really numerics, but not

285
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,420
numerics as we are taught.

286
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,680
Twenty two over seven is pi.

287
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,420
That is a indicates a whole relationship between the circumference of the diameter

288
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,640
that is a whole number.

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,420
Right. Well, it is a number that is contained.

290
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,560
It's finite. But once you start going just to numbers, if you divide 22 by seven,

291
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,700
you'll have super computers running that division for years and years and still

292
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,940
can't figure out what it is.

293
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,080
Right. It seems to go on for infinity and it never repeats itself.

294
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,660
But if you if you represent it with a circumference, just a drawn circle with a

295
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,460
line across, meaning the diameter, that's the representation of the proportion.

296
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,720
So how come it falls apart when you try to do it just numerically, meaning you'll

297
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,920
never find the end, but you can represent it geometrically.

298
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,760
And that's how the memory actually works.

299
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,260
That's why when you do rudimentary search, the most popular thing they're promoting

300
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,420
is memory palaces.

301
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,580
Right. So when you when you encounter something that you deliberately recall to

302
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,180
yourself, this is worth remembering or I want to remember it.

303
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,660
There's techniques for that.

304
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't use that.

305
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,100
I do use that, but not in the directly.

306
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
You have to custom tailor.

307
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,560
What I use is a song and it doesn't mean what it's so simple, it's hard to

308
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,680
comprehend. I'm doing some gardening and I got some rice cooking, you know, by

309
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,760
the way, whenever there's a comment on Greek speak, you know how to cook perfect

310
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,480
rice is one of like the most sarcastic comments out there.

311
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,900
Right. I've seen it over and over.

312
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Right. OK. All right.

313
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,560
So because I kept pushing that and, you know, believe it or not, anyone who did the

314
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,700
directions, I make perfect.

315
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,560
Right. Here, cover your ears.

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,040
But most white people can't cook for shit.

317
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,380
Right. Oh, did I just say that?

318
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,120
I'll take that back. No, I don't take that back.

319
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,400
Because I don't know.

320
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,980
All right. But but cooking rice.

321
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,780
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

322
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,620
That's like threading a needle at 100 feet.

323
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,060
So what do you do?

324
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,660
You go to the stuff that you know they're going to fail in every time, every one of

325
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,480
them, pretty much. And you put that out in a way that is orderly.

326
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,600
And all the semantics and syntax are there.

327
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
You can't screw it up.

328
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,640
And everyone admits that now they're making perfect rice.

329
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,280
What a great achievement on something that is so minor.

330
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,900
But it's not even a white person.

331
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,420
Americans House with rice being served.

332
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,840
Oh, my gosh. It's like, oh, my God, it's not.

333
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,040
I mean, it's animal grade.

334
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah. It has to do with technique.

335
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
OK, so I got a pot of rice on.

336
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,540
I can't hear the timer.

337
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,580
I'm not doing some gardening.

338
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,040
I know I got to return in less than 10 minutes.

339
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,540
So I tell myself, all right, you got to sing the rice song and I go back to the

340
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,740
gardening and I come back with two minutes to spare.

341
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,020
Now, hold on a second.

342
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,440
What do you mean the rice song, Greek?

343
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,360
All right. Am I actually writing a song or singing a song?

344
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,860
No, there is absolutely no song stuff going on at all.

345
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,980
All it is, this is why it's so simple.

346
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,180
You'll never figure it out, I tell people, until you figure out to appreciate

347
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,440
things that are so simple that work like I'm out here in the portrait.

348
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,000
I have a little bit of blue tape on the lamps and there's no bugs on the lamps.

349
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,740
It's amazing. A little dot of blue tape.

350
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,359
OK, so simple defies the mind.

351
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,300
Just telling yourself you have to sing a song of, you know, the rice song or

352
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,440
whatever, whatever, wherever.

353
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,920
I got to go pick up my daughter's song.

354
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,079
You just tell yourself you have to sing a song and mention the thing you want to

355
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,760
remember. And it's remembered and it keeps you alert.

356
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,540
There's no singing. There's no song.

357
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,320
You just tell yourself, OK, there's a song involved.

358
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,460
That's all it needs.

359
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,160
That's all the psyche needs.

360
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,680
It's amazing. And I've been playing with this with myself for more than a dozen

361
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,720
years. And I've showed it to other people.

362
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,420
About half the people can do it, half can't because they think if you're going to

363
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,640
sing a song, well, what are the words?

364
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,840
What are the lyrics? What's the music?

365
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,980
What song is it? You know, I don't know a song about rice.

366
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,500
See, that's it gets in the way.

367
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,660
Their own mind gets in the way.

368
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,920
Right. And by the way, I wouldn't recommend playing with yourself too much.

369
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,600
They say you will go blind and.

370
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,160
Yeah, it's possible. Sorry, I doubt it.

371
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,420
I had to play with you.

372
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,420
So we call it self-serve.

373
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,080
I had to say it's self-serve, self-serve.

374
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,660
Good. Yeah, I don't play around.

375
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,480
That is a great way to put it.

376
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,540
Actually, self-service.

377
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,360
Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, like, you know, when you go to a buffet and they got the

378
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,160
salt. Anyway.

379
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,820
Yep. So if you use anyway, I'm not going to get into that.

380
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,820
It's so. All right.

381
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,400
So the concept of a song.

382
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,760
Well, OK, let's go back to Homer's Iliad Odyssey.

383
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,600
Guess what? The Native American history.

384
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,660
Guess what? When you look at a lot of other things with big semantics in it, guess

385
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,160
what? They're all oral traditions.

386
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,900
Everything I mentioned was basically held in an oral tradition, not because writing

387
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,200
was bad and they didn't have writing.

388
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,860
They did have writing, but they lost it.

389
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,420
So there's something about the oral tradition

390
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,660
being mental. It's a song, iambic pentameter, right?

391
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,760
The Greek structure.

392
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,280
So the simplest thing works the best

393
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,480
because if it evades rationalism, the rational mind doesn't get occupied

394
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,280
with it. And the rational mind actually needs things to remind it.

395
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,100
Right. Because it's right. It's a metric.

396
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,740
So if you if you subscribe to things that are very, very simple that work

397
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,000
and learn how to manage those things.

398
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,280
Right. Then you'll be more successful with your memory.

399
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,920
And I know that's a big statement.

400
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,960
But in giving the little song, some people say this is ridiculous and some people

401
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,500
have. But whoever has adopted that find that it works.

402
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,140
And by the way, there's no time scale.

403
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,200
You can say, I have an appointment in two weeks.

404
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,700
I have to sing this appointment song.

405
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,720
That's all you have to do. And guess what?

406
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,360
When that time approaches, you're like, oh, yeah, I remember that.

407
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,300
It's amazing how it works.

408
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,060
Now, there's other techniques, but I just wanted to put that out because you won't

409
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,560
find that anywhere. This is maybe a homegrown Greek speak thing.

410
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,420
Yeah, I guarantee you, I've never heard that before.

411
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,100
Yeah, it's homegrown then.

412
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,820
OK, good. Homebrew.

413
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,540
So, yeah, I wanted to go back.

414
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,200
I actually forgot we were talking about the babies and how they're downloaded.

415
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,880
And but they're not we're not we don't rely on those downloads because we change so

416
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,620
radically that it doesn't work anymore.

417
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,280
Right. And you told us a story about the baby on the couch telling the joke and all

418
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
that. So they all left. Yeah.

419
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,940
And it was choreographed as if it was a I think they once did a baby movie.

420
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,580
They were acting like adults or something.

421
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,120
And it was fascinated by that because it allowed me to see into their world.

422
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,180
I didn't understand anything he was saying at all.

423
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,740
And it was complex, obviously, by the you know, they're all listening intently.

424
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,360
Eye contact, gestures, just like you would choreograph someone telling a joke.

425
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,500
Right. And a mob film.

426
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,960
Sure. Yeah.

427
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,500
And I found that to be incredible.

428
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,880
Now, the thing about the body, the body size sounds like someone's working on their

429
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,820
trailer. I'm going to go inside.

430
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,580
No problem. I'm surprised we didn't hear from Ivan.

431
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,680
Yeah, I'm on the stupid rectangle, by the way.

432
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,780
You'll hear an audio change probably in the background.

433
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,640
So so what's going on is with memory, by the way, I'm not sure if the if you were to

434
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,380
loosely look at the etymology, mem is water and order means light in the Hebraic

435
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,420
vernacular or, you know, the cognates.

436
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,940
Right. So it's interesting how it's water, light, water and light put together.

437
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,560
But what I would suggest with the memory, it's external as well.

438
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,680
Right. You know, you've heard of people.

439
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,080
Actually, they're very good at covering up stuff in terms of, you know, there are

440
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,060
people that don't have a brain, you know, function, you know, this might be some

441
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,580
left, you know, from an accident, you know, or something.

442
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
And they're still pretty functional.

443
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,780
You know, I was trying to explain someone the other day.

444
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,800
You know, when someone's in a coma, they call them a vegetable in a vegetative

445
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,520
state. But, you know, this is a little diversion here, a tangent.

446
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,520
But you notice how they stop there.

447
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,540
And someone brought that up and I was like, OK, so you have a vegetable, someone in a

448
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,780
coma is considered a vegetable, a vegetative state.

449
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Let's continue. What do you call the average normie people in the collective, the

450
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,280
people? And I'm talking about, you know, your family, your friends, the people you

451
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,740
see on the street could be in this, too.

452
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,260
Right. What's a step up from vegetable animal?

453
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,780
Yeah. Yeah. And what's an animal?

454
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,280
Livestock. Oh, perfect.

455
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,540
So now we got the vegetative state, the vegetable, which is the few.

456
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,740
And then we go to the livestock, which is I call them that before, you know, the

457
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,300
normie, the NPCs, whatever.

458
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,620
Right. And then what do you get after that?

459
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,680
Then you go to man and woman or human.

460
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,360
And a lot of people, the Jordan Maxwell's and the others have really ruined that

461
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,280
word. They said told everyone it means monster.

462
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,540
It was in a legal dictionary as a side note.

463
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:53,480
So anyway, I just want to bring that up, the legitimate use of the word livestock

464
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,840
to mention most people because they're like animals, just as someone who is, you

465
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,420
know, just breathing and have a just basic soul.

466
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,260
Right. Metabolism is a vegetable.

467
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,740
I thought it was kind of cute to go from vegetable to animal.

468
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,080
Right. We never we never dogged on the minerals ever called.

469
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,760
I know. Well, actually, in the British said that you have the minerals, meaning like

470
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,660
you have the balls. Right.

471
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,560
So later, the stones.

472
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,980
Right. So the stones.

473
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:28,880
Yeah. So, again, it's very, very tantalizing to think about the structure being so

474
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
important to them, to the function as a child, having a complex language and social

475
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,780
structure potentially changing very quickly.

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,060
And then how does that connect to memory?

477
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,100
And that's the first thing I brought up is that it's not it's some parts of your

478
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,920
memory, if not most of it is based on what the ham radio operators talk about.

479
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,740
Right. So so what do ham radio operators talk about?

480
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,020
Right. That's not fair.

481
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
I I haven't been one, but I've been around them.

482
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,420
Frequency, antenna length, right.

483
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,860
Power. Oh, yeah.

484
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,520
I used to have shortwave longwave radios and stuff, and I never talked on those, but

485
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,740
I could pick them up.

486
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,700
And oh, my gosh, it's critical to some degree.

487
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,500
But once you get into the very forgiving as well.

488
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,700
But if you want, you know, best signal.

489
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,880
So so there is something.

490
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,060
So what do you do with the adults?

491
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,280
Let's say we're presuming most of the people listening to this are adults.

492
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,900
What do you do? Right.

493
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,820
Well, the the easiest thing to improve memory is to pay attention.

494
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,300
In other words, don't take don't take things for granted and avoid idle chitchat

495
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,580
and things that annoy you.

496
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,880
But how's that?

497
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,380
Because annoyance is a form of trauma, by the way.

498
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,440
Right. It's a slight trauma.

499
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,960
You know, it's kind of like the drop.

500
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,400
What is the old famous saying?

501
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,460
The Chinese water torture.

502
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,760
Right. It was just drop, drop, drop.

503
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,860
Right. Oh, yeah. Right.

504
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,380
Yeah, it's cumulative.

505
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,860
So those are very simple hints.

506
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,140
What I've homegrown is the song.

507
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,540
Just tell yourself, you know, what you want to remember as a song.

508
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,900
There's no song, by the way.

509
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,480
I don't have to go over that.

510
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,860
It's just it's so simple.

511
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,700
It's it's unusually simple, but it tends to jog the mind.

512
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,520
And what do they call like a sticky note kind of thing, you know?

513
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,080
And it kind of works for it works for me and whoever pretty much got it.

514
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,420
The other thing is those that are good observers are good.

515
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
Memory have better memory.

516
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
I've noticed in life.

517
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,880
In other words, if you're in a situation that's let's say you were three people

518
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
and the three of you go somewhere and see something that you've never seen before.

519
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,460
And it's an action.

520
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,420
And the one that is the best observer.

521
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,380
We'll have we'll be able to recall more of the event

522
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,400
because of the input, more input right now, here's the thing.

523
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
The body will not.

524
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
You know how they say the universe doesn't give you more than you can handle.

525
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,000
Right. OK.

526
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,500
People that are good observers have good memories

527
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and people that have good memories are good observers,

528
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,180
because if you are a good observer and you don't have the memory to handle it,

529
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,080
it's a waste, isn't it?

530
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,340
And vice versa.

531
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,940
Well, this is true.

532
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,520
And some people fool themselves.

533
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,440
And I know they do it.

534
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,520
I've watched them do it where they start to add information to something

535
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,780
based on something that's erroneous, not their observation.

536
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,260
Plus confabulation.

537
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,740
But they yeah, they begin to add in because look at all times.

538
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,940
Memory is malleable. I agree with that.

539
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,620
You can always add information to it and then skew the whole situation

540
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
and screw it up.

541
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,720
Because if you start to interpret something, this is where the problem comes in.

542
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,360
If you simply observe it and take it in,

543
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,040
you can learn a great deal more by objectively observing it

544
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,820
than starting to add your own information to it. Right.

545
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,920
Well, you see, it's not just yes, it's not about memory.

546
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,160
Then it's like, what does it take to be a good observer?

547
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,640
By the way, they're in what they call in air quotes

548
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,820
and the jerk off hand sign at the same time.

549
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,040
And if you can imagine that law enforcement supposedly has trained observers,

550
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,040
right, they train, you know, and they bring up someone as a technical

551
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,880
whatever, they say he's a trained observer. Right.

552
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,040
You hear the military or law enforcement. Right.

553
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,080
Yeah. Yeah. Stuff like that. Yeah.

554
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,920
So and I that I'm not that's not what I'm talking about.

555
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,380
But there and I and I don't like to say it's

556
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,340
there's a natural proclivity towards it.

557
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,860
But it seems like some people tend to be better observers than others. Right.

558
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah. And by the way, that training does give them an upgrade

559
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,580
from the average upright walking individual around.

560
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,380
They are a little better at it than, you know, common person.

561
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,960
But are they doing it right?

562
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,260
I don't think so. Oh, yeah.

563
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,420
And by the way, did they did they learn that by taking a class

564
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,480
or did they learn that by actually being a good observer? Oh.

565
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,020
Oh, wait. Yeah. When they're actually good at it, it's because they've done it.

566
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,640
Right. Yeah. Right.

567
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,720
Or if you took a class in it.

568
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,920
Well, you know who taught it?

569
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,180
There's so many factors. Why did you have to take a class in it?

570
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,980
And right. So that's why whenever I've had to teach anybody anything,

571
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,100
I've told you this before.

572
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,620
I always, you know, made them do it.

573
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,680
Look, just do this. Start to do this.

574
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,480
Here's the basic thing you need to start with.

575
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,620
I'm going to do something that they can get hurt and that they have no knowledge.

576
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,740
I don't know what to do.

577
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,460
You say children all the time.

578
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,460
Yes. You safety the issue so that it's not a big deal.

579
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,200
But you have them do it.

580
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,360
That's the way I disagree with that in a big way.

581
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,380
It's just like when you see you go to someone's house that has children

582
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,760
and they have the crayon drawings on the refrigerator and they

583
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
because I think they should all be thrown away.

584
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,320
So you don't give someone that has no skills, no skill in expressing themselves

585
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,540
and to draw and say how good it looks.

586
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,220
It looks like crap.

587
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,080
But you got to give the children at least maybe a few hours

588
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,060
and how to draw proportion.

589
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Then they can express themselves better.

590
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,540
You know, I'm talking about the cheesy drawings, stick figures

591
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,860
and the size of the house.

592
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,040
That's garbage. Don't do that to a child.

593
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,500
That should not be done.

594
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,420
No, no, no. Look, I let them do that to start with.

595
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
And then I say, OK, well, that's here's what you're doing.

596
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,500
Here's what you're not doing.

597
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,860
And now let me instruct you a bit.

598
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,080
Now take it and do it again.

599
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,240
By the way, this is part of the kids culture.

600
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,220
This is very carefully crafted, like the Skinner system, Skinner boxes,

601
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,080
psychological stuff and, you know, Bernays all at that time.

602
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,800
You know, after the 20th century, the whole Bolshevik movement, you know,

603
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,360
which I'd like to do a tangent on that real quick.

604
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,920
There's a lot of people I've been running into lately

605
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,380
that don't know about the money system and don't care to you

606
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,940
because they say, oh, I'm a craftsman or I'm an artist or whatever.

607
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,900
All right. Well, what they fail to recall

608
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,260
is that at the turn of the 20th century, the Bolshevik movement,

609
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,300
which basically came out of Wall Street in Brooklyn, a bunch of Brooklyn guys.

610
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,640
It was nothing to do with the Russians.

611
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,660
You could look at the history.

612
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,940
The people that revolted and killed the czar,

613
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,980
then they were killed for another revolution, right?

614
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,000
It's systematic, right?

615
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,120
OK, that happened there to reorganize the culture

616
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,560
based on what that culture can understand the communism thing, right?

617
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
In America, they did the same thing,

618
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,860
but they didn't do it that way.

619
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,000
What they did was they

620
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,320
they took the money system away and made it fiat currency.

621
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,460
In fact, they started with fractional banking and then fiat.

622
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,100
So someone who says they don't understand the money system

623
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,940
or not interested in it is like living in Soviet communist Bolshevik

624
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,320
Russia and saying, I don't understand communism

625
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,320
or don't care to or whatever.

626
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,860
You're going to run into a lot of problems, right?

627
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,340
Very quickly.

628
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,820
So not necessarily if you're in the outskirts, but, you know,

629
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,420
when you're in in the collective.

630
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,800
So what they've done with the Americans is much, much worse.

631
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,780
It's much more insidious because guess what?

632
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,040
In 89, the wall came down and they reorganized it and opened it.

633
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,200
But in 89, did anything happen?

634
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,300
Reorganizing the financial system here is getting worse and worse,

635
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,140
getting worse and worse.

636
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,400
So that was the tangent. So

637
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,800
let's go back to what we were

638
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,420
we were saying about learning things and experiences and all that.

639
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,780
That's very that's a big, big, big thing with the children and the drawings.

640
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,260
What you don't give children crayons and say, draw and then say,

641
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,480
oh, look what they drew up. Beautiful.

642
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,760
Looks like crap. Throw it away.

643
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,660
Did the child get any instruction how to express themselves in that?

644
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Just like a four year old banging on a piano.

645
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,380
There's no experience, right?

646
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,640
I mean, if they start playing Chopin, that's like maybe one out of a billion.

647
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,140
Do you think you think one out of a billion four year olds

648
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,620
can just jump on a piano, start playing Chopin? Is that possible?

649
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,580
Yes, it is. Probably. Yeah, that sounds about right.

650
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:26,980
That's right.

651
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,600
So the same thing when I see these children's drawings that the parents

652
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,280
hang in the house, on their office or on the refrigerator, as you throw that away.

653
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,560
It's terrible. Would you record the four year old banging on the piano?

654
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,480
So listen, how beautiful. It doesn't sound beautiful.

655
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,460
So when it's a self-denial, what is it to take the ugly

656
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,940
and the misinformed and the uninformed and the unskilled and saying,

657
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,400
look how beautiful it is, it's an effect on the mind.

658
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,600
The other thing is to show the children, just go out and do stuff,

659
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,740
because the more you do stuff, the more we have attorneys

660
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,720
that could charge you for doing it now.

661
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,140
You get it?

662
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,900
How many times have you seen attorneys charge people?

663
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,720
Well, you got all these charges, right?

664
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
You know, because why?

665
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,240
Because they don't understand what they did to the Bolsheviks.

666
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,980
They did over here, but using the money system. Right.

667
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,020
So this is a complex thing.

668
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,280
But this is this is, again, in other words, there is a certain amount of order

669
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,960
and a certain amount of instruction that is necessary before

670
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,020
someone starts on anything.

671
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Well, I understand. But, you know, look, because I had to transfer

672
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,540
the ability to do certain tasks.

673
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,480
OK, I'm not going to describe specifics here, but I tried.

674
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,840
Look, observe me.

675
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,640
And it was it was just impossible.

676
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,460
I seem to be confronted with a good observer or not.

677
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,180
Like my wife. She's not a good observer.

678
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,800
I've been working with her for 20 years.

679
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,580
No, she's not a good observer. Right.

680
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,980
But I didn't make her bad.

681
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,740
No, no. Does it make her good? No.

682
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,300
But it means in order to teach her to do something,

683
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,500
you can't just ask her to observe something, probably. Right.

684
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,080
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.

685
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,400
So what happens is you start seeing these things.

686
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,560
And when you get later on, you know, I'm in my sixth decade,

687
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,640
you start realizing, OK, that will probably never change

688
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,300
in the ever we have left.

689
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,820
But if we live to a thousand

690
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,560
by the time this person is not a good observer,

691
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,520
it might be around 450 years old.

692
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
They might pick it up then.

693
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,740
Well, we don't have that kind of time. No, we don't.

694
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,860
So what that what that makes is it makes things that people do not improve in,

695
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,980
even over long periods of time, it makes it more pressing.

696
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,740
And then when you make it more pressing, then you have conflict.

697
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,180
So what do you do? You have to leave it alone.

698
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,980
Right. And that's the world that we live in.

699
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
But here's the thing.

700
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,600
There is a subtle line between pressing someone into

701
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,040
they have to do this better because of the time they have left at the rate

702
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,660
they're going, they'll have to live to a thousand to catch up.

703
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,740
And that, you know, some people feel like they have that luxury, by the way.

704
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,240
Do they act like it?

705
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,320
They do act like it's in the DNA somehow.

706
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,760
I you know, I can't disagree with you there because I see that.

707
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,140
And I say to myself, look, and you know what?

708
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,420
Some people, if they live to be a thousand,

709
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,360
I know they wouldn't master what it is they're trying to do.

710
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,260
And it's really sad to me.

711
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Anyway, it's interesting.

712
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,280
I have another idea, but I also want to address the speed reading,

713
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,900
which was the other part of the question in the chat, if you don't mind, real fast.

714
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,900
But perhaps we can talk about identity at a certain point

715
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,540
because I had this weird idea and maybe I'll get into it with you on the next

716
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,199
Sonic, but speed reading or finish out with the memory thing.

717
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,219
But it's interesting to me.

718
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,780
You have you have a very

719
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,420
yeah, you have me considering something very interesting here.

720
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,080
I think I think I'm starting to change my mind.

721
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,820
I don't have much. It's just like driving a car.

722
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,580
Would you give someone I'm using the regular vernacular, OK?

723
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,639
If you give someone some keys, they just they started.

724
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,020
They started driving a week ago.

725
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Is he here? Go to the race.

726
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,659
Go to the race right now with the car. Go ahead and race it.

727
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,760
Well, no, it's not going to work. Right.

728
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,000
Actually, most people think they'll crash.

729
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,800
Actually, they'll be so terrified they won't do anything.

730
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,880
They'll just sit there, you know, as if they're out of gas, you know,

731
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,980
or the engine died.

732
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,420
Believe it or not, because being in a race is very intimidating.

733
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,980
It sure is. Yeah, they probably won't crash it.

734
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,840
But the chances of them crashing is extremely high as well.

735
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,920
So the same thing with speed reading.

736
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,180
What I suggest with that is the typical textbook

737
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,240
before you even do that, just be a good observer.

738
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,320
What I mean by that is when you get a book,

739
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,440
especially something that's technical, even this works with novels.

740
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,740
The author usually when you write a book and publish a book,

741
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,600
if something is really important, guess what?

742
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,740
Not only do you write a little bit more about it, you might give what?

743
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,100
A picture, an illustration, a graph, a chart. Right. Right.

744
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,220
OK, so you just do what you do, whatever the subject is.

745
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
It doesn't matter how big the textbook is or technical book.

746
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,940
Let's just stick with the technical book, for example. OK.

747
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,460
You look at the front and back cover.

748
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,260
Very obvious.

749
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,860
And then you go to the table of contents and just browse the table of contents.

750
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,840
That gives you an idea.

751
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,180
I mean, have you ever seen a table of contents like 15 pages long?

752
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,200
I've seen that sometimes.

753
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,560
Oh, my gosh. Yes.

754
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
The divisions in here.

755
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
That means there's a lot of divisions, a lot of multitude

756
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,560
of various topics and things. Right.

757
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,900
Right. A big, thick book with three chapters. Easy. Right.

758
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,300
I mean, you know, the same thing.

759
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,740
They just talk more about the same thing.

760
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,600
You know, 150 chapters. Wow.

761
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,660
That'll covering 150 items most likely.

762
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,440
And then start going through the chapters page by page very quickly

763
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,100
and look for graphs and pictures. Why?

764
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,100
Because if they actually invested in putting in an illustration or a graph,

765
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,560
guess what?

766
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,040
They want to emphasize that point or it must be important.

767
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,740
Don't worry about learning or memorizing that.

768
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,160
Just keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

769
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,180
Let's get to the end.

770
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,880
There's glossaries, appendices, footnotes, credits,

771
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,760
you know, that they give to others. Right. Right.

772
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,580
And if there's none, you might say this is either plagiarized,

773
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,600
heavily plagiarized, or this person has really done a lot of research,

774
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
authentic research. Right.

775
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,160
It's got to be very original,

776
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,360
especially if you don't see like a bibliography where they write a bibliography.

777
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,900
Right. So if you don't see that, you're like,

778
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,540
whoa, this who this is incredible.

779
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,660
You know, if it's worth looking at the subject matter is interested to you.

780
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,500
And it's not bullshit.

781
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,360
Also, also an index at the end is an interesting indicator as well.

782
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,680
Yeah. Good.

783
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,100
Then when you go back to the chapter beginning,

784
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,240
look at what each chapter introduces.

785
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,200
But believe it or not,

786
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,820
even if you don't read the introduction to the chapter, guess what?

787
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,580
It's usually in the title itself.

788
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,160
You don't have to do much reading in the beginning at all.

789
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,220
Go to the end of the chapter and usually basic essay writing classes.

790
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,320
They give you you must come to a conclusion.

791
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,040
You already know what the chapter is about based on just the title alone.

792
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,220
Mostly you could read the first sentence or to read

793
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,100
the closing of the chapter last two or three sentences.

794
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,280
If it tells you, for example,

795
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,260
this one is about a certain type of tuberculosis virus,

796
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,320
but it shows completely inconclusive.

797
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,520
No evidence in the experiment.

798
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,500
Oh, great. Do you want to go back and read the whole chapter?

799
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,520
Because what you just got the final point that doesn't exist. Right.

800
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,240
You don't have to read the whole chapter to find out

801
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,100
how the tuberculosis virus doesn't exist. Do you? Right.

802
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,100
You see. And you go through each chapter.

803
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,200
Right. Another chapter is, you know, setting up a standard protocol,

804
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,940
let's say, for testing for disease.

805
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,620
And you go to the end of that. That's the title.

806
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,100
You go to the end of the chapter. You read a few sentences.

807
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,760
It doesn't seem like we'll be able to set set up a standard

808
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,960
protocol for disease for a very long time.

809
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,940
All right. And what was it written?

810
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,460
It was written in the 70s. Well, it's a very long time.

811
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,960
All right. So now you got that.

812
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,260
You go to the next chapter.

813
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,360
You see, now we cover two chapters in what, 30 seconds? Yep.

814
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,080
And you go on. So guess what?

815
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,800
If you use this method within about 45 minutes,

816
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,020
you'll be able to have a discussion with the author,

817
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,140
an intelligent discussion with the author.

818
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,460
But most people, how do they do it?

819
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,820
Let's say this is a 500 page book.

820
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,660
Three days later. Oh, I'm still on the first chapter.

821
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I just got the book three days ago. It's a heavy read.

822
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,740
How many times you hear that?

823
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,360
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

824
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,840
Right. A month later. Oh, I'm halfway through.

825
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,640
I don't know what you're talking about in Chapter 37.

826
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,460
Right. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

827
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,740
You see, you just you just gave the methodology I used to use

828
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,060
when I would go to a bookstore and I'd see a JFK book

829
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,380
I never saw before and I'd go, OK, and I do exactly what you just said.

830
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,100
Just get through and figure out whether it was worth me

831
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,020
putting down some money to buy the thing.

832
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,720
Right. It's not just skipping through.

833
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,520
You can actually intelligently communicate how you do it

834
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,060
and get a lot of value out of it.

835
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,780
Oh, no. I already knew what was in the book

836
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,640
by the time I was done with the process.

837
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,500
This technique is not discussed much.

838
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,400
Well, no, it's not.

839
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,360
But but that's how I used to decide whether I was going to spend the money.

840
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,580
Oh, yeah. Well, and then if you if it's a text, a college book,

841
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,360
look if there are any quizzes or tests at the end of the chapter.

842
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,740
Mm hmm. They usually do that. Right.

843
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah. And guess what?

844
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,040
You don't try to take the quiz because you don't you're not informed.

845
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,580
But when you're reading the chapter, go reference back to the go start.

846
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,720
If you were to read the whole chapter, go back and look at what the quiz

847
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,560
questions on and focus on those because they're basically giving you,

848
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,580
you know, the whole outline. Right. Oh, Jack.

849
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,520
So this way you could succeed a little more so you could go out to the bar

850
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,280
and drink and whatever you do at college, you know.

851
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,220
So and some of those things are very easy to do, because all you got to do

852
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,060
is like some of them, they say, here's a you know, they don't suggest

853
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,500
you use it as a quiz like in class or whatever, but they say you should take

854
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,880
this quiz, this little quiz at the end here to see if you retain

855
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,940
the knowledge from the chapter.

856
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,280
If you go to that first, as opposed to, you know, what you've set yourself up.

857
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,120
Yeah. You know what they're setting you up for,

858
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,960
which will probably brought up again later in some form of instruction,

859
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,520
you know, class or whatever, which is.

860
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,720
Yeah. Yeah. And if you're filling in gaps in your knowledge,

861
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,220
you can go there and say, OK, I know how to answer this, this, this, this.

862
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,020
But I don't know this.

863
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,280
You can go you can go flip through the chapter usually and find it

864
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,880
pretty quickly, fill in the gaps in your knowledge without a problem.

865
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,340
Right. Speed reading.

866
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,660
By the way, for speed reading, I have no direct way of doing it

867
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,600
other than what's out there.

868
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,180
There's classes that were been famous since the 70s.

869
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,780
Remember, there was speed reading classes advertised in the TV guy.

870
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Oh, yes. The 70s. Right.

871
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,620
So quite popular.

872
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,960
And here's the thing.

873
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,720
What I do is, you know, the intelligence

874
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,560
intelligence officers how to do an interrogation.

875
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,600
The four things.

876
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Listen to how they're saying what they're saying

877
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,380
and look at how they're saying what they're saying

878
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,220
and then look at how they're not saying what they're saying. Right.

879
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,560
Those are the two things.

880
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,780
But basically, I'm just just still paraphrased.

881
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,120
You have to look at what how they're saying, what they're saying

882
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,560
and also look at how what they're not saying. Right.

883
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,040
So what I do with that is when I'm when I want to speed read,

884
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,980
I try to filter out all the does, is, was them, us, all the conjugations,

885
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,060
pronouns, you know, not pronouns, but, you know, what are those things called? Right.

886
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,440
All the grammatical devices that are there to, you know, make it.

887
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,060
And what I imagine in the imaginary, all books have margins.

888
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,780
All some smaller than others. Right. Right.

889
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,200
What I try to do is what's really is imagine that all of those

890
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,380
the is is for and that I imagine a dust of dust brush.

891
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,840
And I and I brush all those words often to the margin.

892
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,400
And what's left is the meat.

893
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,700
And I go through that very quickly.

894
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,120
And in the beginning, it's very difficult to do.

895
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,080
But once you learn how to do it, it's almost as if all the unnecessary parts

896
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,560
are highlighted and you avoid them naturally.

897
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,360
And that's how you go through fast.

898
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,680
But for example, again, with the wife, there'll be something page up

899
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,200
to read on a video, you know, on a screen in the living room.

900
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
And I'll look at it's a paragraph and I'll look at it.

901
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,940
Five, four, three, two, one. I read it.

902
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,140
She's like, oh, I'm still need more time.

903
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,040
Right. So why?

904
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,660
Because she's reading it the way that they intended.

905
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,920
What I'm saying is not the way it's intended to be read.

906
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,500
You see. Right.

907
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,960
So I'm driving on the white line kind of thing.

908
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,180
Right. In between lanes here. Right.

909
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,960
But what I do, just like the rice song, you know, sing a song.

910
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,000
Right. There's no song.

911
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,380
What I'm doing is but here what I'm doing is imaginary

912
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,480
in an imaginary sense, all the fluff and excess.

913
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,020
I'm moving over to the side of the plate, you know, which is the margin

914
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,600
and trying to target the main point.

915
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,600
Now, is that a good thing to, you know, if it's something important

916
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,840
and if it's a good story?

917
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,800
No, you shouldn't do that, really.

918
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,980
I think there's speed reading classes that can assist you and better.

919
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,740
But that's what I've developed on my own is to share. Right.

920
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,440
And if you're trying to glean information from something, that's one thing.

921
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,300
If you're attempting to just familiarize yourself with the story, that's fine.

922
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,160
But if you actually want to enjoy the story, I wouldn't suggest speed reading.

923
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,260
Well, because it's yeah, it's also the amount of time

924
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,460
that you spend reading also has an effect on the mind. Right.

925
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,640
Well, but that's the thing, you know, if you want to invest that time

926
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,180
and you want to experience the you know, I used to enjoy.

927
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,500
I don't know. You probably find this silly,

928
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,160
but I used to enjoy sometimes going into the story of things

929
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,400
and really, you know, making it up in my own head, drawing those pictures,

930
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,060
you know, imagining the scene as it's laid out, things like that.

931
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,680
You can't really do that as a speed reader.

932
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,780
I don't think maybe maybe you can.

933
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,020
But it seems to me as though it's time to percolate. Am I wrong about that?

934
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,080
No, there's those also.

935
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,020
You got to understand it.

936
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,880
But what's being served up to the collective, to the common people is garbage.

937
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,660
Always. So if it depends, you know what I mean?

938
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,220
Like one man's junk is another man's treasure, vice versa. Right.

939
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,840
So, for example, all the stuff that they told us in school for the past 100 years,

940
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,640
I've noticed what are the Clavie Elmer said, Emerson, Twain,

941
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,420
Melville. I can't read stuff is junk.

942
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,060
I read them like, well, my gosh, this is a classic.

943
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,800
It's so poorly written. Why are they doing this?

944
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,680
Ah, you know, so that's the dumbing down and the screwing

945
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,180
with the mind was done a long time ago by taking these degenerate writers

946
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,400
and telling you these are the classics. Read them. They're great.

947
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,800
They suck. Right.

948
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,460
You notice you ever notice you read some of the classics, even Dickens.

949
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,580
A lot of Dickens works. Oh, my gosh, it's horrible.

950
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,640
And they're putting this crap.

951
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,340
So the crap, the crapola, the stuff that they've been doing

952
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,280
to make a demented population,

953
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,720
keep them busy and keep them dumb and keep them in the livestock division

954
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,600
is you will find that what they call are the classics.

955
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,600
So when you say, then what do you enjoy?

956
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,460
Like, I think one of the best writers that I've ever read is Frank Herbert.

957
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,660
If you read his stuff, that's of course, it's an opinion.

958
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,680
It's like saying, what's your favorite ice cream? Right.

959
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,720
So but there's stuff out there that is way better than the classics,

960
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,800
way better. Philip K. Dick.

961
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,520
Right. I mean, you talk about a story.

962
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,120
Oh, my gosh. You know, you know, it's like taking drugs. Right.

963
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,860
So you could and you could follow along.

964
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,020
But here's the thing.

965
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,220
We've been messed with for so long that unless you're 100 plus years old

966
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,860
and more than that and you have a good memory, no pun intended, you won't see it.

967
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,400
So, well, that's that's fair enough.

968
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,360
And I you probably think I'm nuts.

969
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,420
But again, you know, what's your favorite ice cream?

970
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,900
I like Kurt Vonnegut.

971
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,060
Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Yeah.

972
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,660
Sluton House. Yeah.

973
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,860
Slaughterhouse Five.

974
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,360
Slaughterhouse Five. I mean, Timequake, even though they panned it, I liked it,

975
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,360
you know, and yeah, stuff like that.

976
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,320
So anyway.
