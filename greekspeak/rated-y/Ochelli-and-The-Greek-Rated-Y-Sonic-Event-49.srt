1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,070
And if your devices are charged and running, you are getting another sonic event.

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,050
This is the Greek, and here's Chuck.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:16,730
Hey, Chuck.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,510
Hey, we're breaking the pattern, right?

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,490
Everybody went, wait a second.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,050
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,830
Rated Y.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,990
You're listening to Rated Y because, well, and it's the unculting of humanity.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,670
You know, we've never really brought up that slogan.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,510
I guess you could call it a slogan, the unculting of humanity.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,590
I was trying to explain this the other day to some people that someone described something

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,150
as a cult.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,990
I said, wait a second.

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,370
All of humanity is in a cult.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,130
So when someone tries to do something different, they're called a cult, right?

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,050
But of course, that has negative connotations and all that.

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,030
And they usually go along the negative connotation side.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,890
But all of humanity, folks, the entire surface, and probably below the surface as well, has

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,690
been cultified big time.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,069
Yeah.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,230
Well, and that's the thing.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,690
It's like a series of cults, honestly.

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,490
That's what I see.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,130
And the funny thing is, by the way, there's this cartoon, I think, called Teenage Euthanasia

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,570
or something.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,890
Or maybe it's not that one.

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,610
Maybe it's another one.

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,950
But this character actually utters in the trailer the unculting.

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,370
You know, the unculting.

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:21,730
Recently?

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,130
How old is that?

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,690
It's pretty new.

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,810
It's like just this year, yeah.

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,830
And it's kind of funny.

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,470
I saw it, and then I checked out the synopsis a little bit.

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,610
And the funny thing is, it's a comedy based on this girl, I think, that is inheriting

37
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,890
her father's cult.

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,750
It's all comedy.

39
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,630
You better keep it in comedy because you don't want the tragedy.

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,850
By the way, you know, tragedy means you know the outcome and you go through with it anyway,

41
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,190
right?

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,770
Oh, yeah.

43
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,110
You know it.

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,930
You know it's going to turn.

45
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,650
That's the point of the tragedy, actually.

46
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,690
That's why when people say, oh, it's a tragedy.

47
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,350
I go, really?

48
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,270
So you didn't expect it to turn out that way?

49
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:55,970
Yeah.

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,790
But the comedy is supposed to be funny.

51
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,610
It isn't always, right?

52
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,470
Well, comedy used to have a slightly different meaning, didn't it?

53
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,910
You know, speaking of meanings.

54
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,810
It's a Greek.

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,810
It's just a ancient Greek word for theater.

56
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,330
But yeah.

57
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,789
Right.

58
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,550
Exactly.

59
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,350
So speaking of meanings, somebody emailed me about this, you know, the story of the

60
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,190
10 plagues in the Bible.

61
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,710
And I asked him to clarify the question, but it's just an interesting thing they brought

62
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,070
up.

63
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,870
So that's supposed to be clarified.

64
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,670
But go ahead.

65
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,210
Well, no, but I wanted the question clarified so I could ask it properly because it was like,

66
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,210
you know, good.

67
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,790
Default.

68
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,470
Default.

69
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,070
Default.

70
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,630
Default is this.

71
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,810
Anything that's old.

72
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,990
OK, what's old?

73
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,430
Pre 1920, pre 1890.

74
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,350
All right.

75
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,110
Why is it out in public?

76
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,070
There's such a thing called an FBI book seizure list.

77
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,470
It was really hot and popping up until the 60s, by the way.

78
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,010
That's right.

79
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,290
And yeah.

80
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,710
So why are they why are they allowing it on the surface?

81
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,090
Right.

82
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,830
So here's the thing.

83
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,550
I used to be called a Bible guru and all that.

84
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,410
Yeah, I'll take that.

85
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:01,730
Yeah.

86
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,930
Well, you know, whatever.

87
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,110
And other compliments.

88
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,030
Thanks for the flowers.

89
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,350
Right.

90
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,930
But what I'll say is, yeah, you know, ethereal ones.

91
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,230
But this is what I'll say.

92
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,530
When we talk about something that sounds like it's talking

93
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,550
about that something.

94
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,130
Right.

95
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,090
So what I mean by that is there's no religion on the planet

96
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,290
that's doing anything or knows anything pretty much.

97
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,390
It's in the text that they allege to subscribe in.

98
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,650
Same with academia.

99
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,210
Go look at an academic textbook.

100
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,290
It's the current philosophy, political twist on it.

101
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:33,570
Right.

102
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,930
Yeah.

103
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,970
On a textbook.

104
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,350
Right.

105
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,450
And not what's held in research or libraries, let's say.

106
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,350
So when we talk about, let's say, anything in the Bible,

107
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,810
three things come up.

108
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,630
The first is, why?

109
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,970
Why did they leave it out?

110
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,490
Right.

111
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,730
And it's going to it's a double edged sword.

112
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,890
It's a brainwashing tool.

113
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,210
But at the same time, it's a foundation for what they're

114
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,510
how they decide to operate.

115
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,170
You know, the classic part of society or conservative part

116
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,790
of society.

117
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,070
The other thing is you're not really getting you're getting

118
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,070
a redacted, altered version.

119
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,610
And then the other thing is, why should you take interest?

120
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,930
Right.

121
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,310
So the majority will probably take interest because what

122
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,490
cults do is they they have to offer choices, but it's

123
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,829
the choices that they offer.

124
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,130
Right.

125
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,910
So when you look at the major religions, they're they all

126
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,370
come from the same place.

127
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,190
Power structure.

128
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,210
So if you don't like Christianity, you go to Judaism

129
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,910
or Islam or Hindu or Buddhist.

130
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,090
All those are heavily controlled and heavily, you know,

131
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,070
however, modified.

132
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,410
Right.

133
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:34,870
Right.

134
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,770
I like that.

135
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,290
Modified.

136
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,850
Modified.

137
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,730
Yeah.

138
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,910
And then you have no choice.

139
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,150
It's you know, you see that all the time.

140
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,570
So you see these white Christian people and they are

141
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,410
disenchanted and they go to become Buddhism and they know

142
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,610
nothing about Buddhism in their whole life.

143
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,070
And because, you know, that's just for most people, these

144
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,090
I don't know, proclivities, your religion, your political

145
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,730
stance, whatever that's been given to you as a choice.

146
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,090
And you have no choice because it's coming from the same

147
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,390
place.

148
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,490
Now, here's what they all have in common, whether it's

149
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,910
academia, science, politics, history, the Bible, anything

150
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,510
like that.

151
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,670
What people.

152
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:11,950
You know, they're they're they're they're they're they're

153
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,690
when people bring up a subject that any of those things that

154
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,950
I mentioned, it's always the du jour current

155
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,510
political spin on that, right?

156
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,170
It's never what's actually been memorialized in the

157
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,470
text.

158
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,390
It's important to look.

159
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,470
I've had someone a couple of people during my lifetime

160
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,050
say, oh, I don't need to, you know, books to learn.

161
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,690
You know, I'm like, it's not the book.

162
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,330
What if it was a completely digital right

163
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,990
on the screen?

164
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,510
What if it was oral to tradition?

165
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,190
What if it was?

166
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,490
It's not just information that if I can access, you can

167
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,150
thing, which, by the way, is going away now that they're digitizing books, by the way.

168
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,610
Oh, of course. Yeah. And we're not talking about like the scanning of books where you still see

169
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,810
the original print. I'm talking about they're just you know, they're not they're rewriting

170
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,550
them essentially slowly. They're not going to do it in shock, you know, shock that many people,

171
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,990
even though it wouldn't matter. But yeah, I don't think here's the thing. I got into the Bible

172
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,570
because of the law form. And then as I tiptoed around everything else, I found out whatever

173
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,510
popular story, the 10 plagues, the burning bush, there's no burning bush, by the way.

174
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,530
It's an angel that was on fire, and he put the bush between him and Moses and

175
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,390
the fire did not consume the bush. There's no burning bush. It's a burning angel.

176
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,710
So anyway, crucifixion was an easy one. Actually, that's the most difficult one because

177
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:41,850
it's been so put through society. Right. That it's very hard to get over that, that there is

178
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:49,830
no crucifixion. Right. So based on understanding of what the text says. Right. So and it doesn't

179
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,070
matter if it's Mel Gibson or it's, you know, an open stage play during the Dark Ages that's going

180
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,750
on in order to, you know, memorialize this story. It's still a story. It's not actually based on the

181
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,590
text at all, at all. Nothing is. Now, look at lately what I've been hammering on is, quote,

182
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,910
unquote, the health field, biology, more biology than the health field. Right. Because

183
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,070
there's good biology, bad biology or whatever. But if you start off with anatomy,

184
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,170
like you do normally in that field, you know, right. If you study the anatomy, you'll see

185
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,270
there's no way all those those tissues are impervious. Right. Whether it's skin, long

186
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,470
intestine, organ tissues are all impervious. There are ducts that communicate in and out.

187
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:38,070
There's orifices and things like that. I like that word orifice anyway. So when they tell you

188
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,130
things are absorbed or when they tell you this process happens, but then they when something

189
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,930
appears this way, then this process occurs. But they skip everything in between because

190
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,530
everyone just says fine. In other words, where do the play? How do the where the

191
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,950
platelets come from? Never discussed. Right. Never discussed how the nutrition gets into the

192
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,590
body. Oh, it's absorbed. Oh, just two words. That's it. Don't ask questions on how it works.

193
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,030
Right. So let's just look at anatomy and see that it's impossible for anything to go. Well,

194
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,710
it's not impossible for anything to go through the tissue. If it does, you won't be living very

195
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,690
long. It's called sepsisemia. You'll die. Toxicity that which happens, by the way, also.

196
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,110
But essentially, there's nothing. It's all energy, all 100 percent energy. Basically,

197
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,330
if you want to know how it works, just leave the biology department or medical department and walk

198
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,309
down the campus to the electrical engineering, maybe or right or physics, maybe physics and

199
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,150
sit down and look about induction and learn about that and then go back. By the way, you know what

200
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:46,550
you learn in university about electricity. I think we've done this before. Let's do it again. It's

201
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,490
worthwhile. Sure. If you want to learn about electricity, you go to two places in university.

202
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,550
One is the physics department. The other one's electrical engineering. Two buildings opposite

203
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,070
each other. Right. So the physics, you know, they look at the circuit and they just study the

204
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:07,350
negative part, the ground. And the positive is just mark plus, let's say, plus one. So you put

205
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,850
a plus one. I mean, I'm sorry, just the ground, which is a negative. So they put a minus one on

206
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,510
the building. Go across the street to electrical engineering. They're studying the positive side

207
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,790
of the circuit. Everything goes to ground. Right. They ignore that pretty much. It's negative.

208
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,530
I just, you know, shunt the ground. Right. So you put a positive one on that building. So physics is

209
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:32,530
minus one and the electrical engineering is positive. What do you get when you put plus one

210
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,350
and minus one together? You get zero. And that's exactly what you're going to learn about that in

211
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,890
college. Right. And that's exactly the truth. That's what they're doing. The physics studies,

212
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,030
the negative and the one and the electrical engineering studies, the positive one. Right.

213
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,010
Put them together. What do you get? It's exactly what you're going to get with your university

214
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,050
education. Now, they'll say, oh, I'm calling bullshit on that Greek because my dad's an

215
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,210
electrical engineer. So am I. We work. Yeah, exactly. What you're going to learn is how to

216
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:08,590
work in industry. And that's it. And when I say industry, is anything from, you know, motorized

217
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:14,350
erector set. Young people even know what that is. Those are the worst things to get. Get those for

218
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,190
Christmas when I was young, because you just ended up with you need a box of Band-Aids, right?

219
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,270
Yeah. For that. It was all the sharp metal. But anyway. Yeah. They came with motors. You

220
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,970
make cranes. OK, so whether that's industry all the way up to whatever old devices, by the way,

221
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,450
that you're using now, the computers, all that stuff has been around except for since the 1800s,

222
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,730
except for the silicon chip, which was much a little bit later. And it's not there's no new

223
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,210
technology. All the technology has actually gone into miniaturizing it, making things smaller.

224
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,050
You're not getting it. You haven't gotten any new technology in 100 years, that's for sure.

225
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,290
That's why when you look at science stuff, all these new discoveries at MIT, they give you this

226
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,110
crappy video with a bunch of snotty 18 year olds from MIT. They're laughing at you, you know,

227
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,510
they put stuff together with hot melt glue and tell you this is what. Oh, my gosh. Mocking

228
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,330
humanity. So anyway, it's all about miniaturization and it doesn't impress me. And I heard

229
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:18,750
miniaturization does not impress the ladies either. So no matter how you look at it. Yeah. Why are

230
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,150
you getting what you're getting? It's all a distraction, which which is what I wanted to

231
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,770
get into a little bit. Not distraction, but what you're getting yourself into and what

232
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,150
what you could be doing. And this might sound a little cultish, actually, because I'm going to

233
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,930
bring up something that people should do if they can, because it's kind of like when you have an

234
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,750
engine that hasn't been maintained well. Sometimes it's recommended you do a flush. Right. Right.

235
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,030
To clean it out. But this is not about cleaning out. This is this will do that also. But what I'm

236
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,370
going to say pretty much is going to if people do it, it'll probably be the first time in their

237
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,710
lives for many of them. I know this, that they had they had something with such value in it.

238
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:20,070
What it is, it's basically cooking a very basic dish and eating it in small quantities and seeing

239
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,710
how you feel. And before I get into the dish, I just want to say that. I've had several people

240
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,930
through the years make comments like, you know, you talk about food, clothing, shelter,

241
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,030
that's so base, you know, we need more than that. Right. I'm like, are you joking?

242
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,950
If you if you can't take care of the qualitative aspect of the most basic things in life,

243
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,110
how are other things going to be helpful? Right. Well, that's that is, you know, and look,

244
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,270
all things begin there. Right. Look, if you're not properly rested, you're not properly fed,

245
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,210
you're not properly sheltered and you're not properly clothed. The rest of what you try to do

246
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,310
is why it becomes, you know, increasingly problematic. Right. Well, hold on to find

247
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,390
properly. That's what I've been trying to get into and why it's proper. And it's not really

248
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,890
something that's subjective. It's leaning towards the objective. Right. Well,

249
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,870
substantially, look, it may be proper to be dressed in a certain way, depending on what

250
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,510
the weather is like around you. OK, you might need a warm coat in some places.

251
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,430
Well, hold on. It's how you're built also, how you're made. Like you give me an example. Some

252
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,470
people will be depending on their diet will be colder in the same environment than other people

253
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,570
with a different diet. Right. Right. When I first came to Tucson, I had to go downtown to one of

254
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,990
the tall buildings here, 15 stories in the elevator. And there was it was winter,

255
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,530
40 ish Fahrenheit. So I was wearing a couple of layers. But there was a guy in a T-shirt

256
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,850
sweating his ass off. And he was in Inuit visiting Tucson. And it was 40 degrees outside. He was hot.

257
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,470
Right. Inuit Eskimo. Well, you and I used to live in the northeast. I mean, come on. Every time

258
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,370
somebody would come from Florida during the winter months, you would see it happen. They

259
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,850
would be losing their minds trying to get warm because they couldn't. You know, I'm standing

260
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,870
there in a T-shirt and I'm like, yeah, it's only 30 degrees out. And when I lived in Jersey,

261
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,030
that was fine. I was totally used to it. And they're sitting there dying. They're like,

262
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,210
oh, my God, I've got blankets on me. I got a coat. I got boots and.

263
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,770
Well, it's acclimation. That's that's what basically I'm glad you brought that up,

264
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:31,050
because I call it acclimating. Right. Adjusting. So people want to seek out all these things,

265
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,450
like what's going on with the world, what's going on with my family, what's going on at work,

266
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:41,130
but they have their own stuff. I've been trying to indirectly include a lot of practical stuff that

267
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:47,550
are helpful. You know, I do it mostly with they talk about hygiene, food and fixing things or

268
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,910
doing things, you know. But one thing I want to bring up is when you're going to start off,

269
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,550
I think I'll always be repeating that we don't absorb anything. The body is completely sealed.

270
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,370
It goes by induction. Right. So what is induction? It's energy. You know, I was having a

271
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,990
discussion with someone who's very materialistic and they weren't quite getting it. They were

272
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,790
they're pretty well versed in all this stuff, you know, quote unquote, college education.

273
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,930
And they were interested in science. So when I say induction, they definitely know.

274
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,370
I don't have to give them too many examples. Right. You know, like the wireless toothbrush

275
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,190
that has no metal contacts. You put it in the thing and it charges. Well, how is it charging?

276
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,550
There's no metal contacting. Right. So induction, stove top. I didn't give it.

277
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,670
They understood this, but I had to break it down in a material way where I said,

278
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,890
think of evaporation and condensation. Think of it that way. But with energy, though. Right.

279
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,870
OK. OK. So once you understand that and then you what it does is it overemphasizes the actual

280
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,090
qualitative, energetic nature of what we eat even more. Give me an example. I don't know

281
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,370
if you've ever heard of anyone working in a food processing plant like Archer Daniel Midlands

282
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,570
or whatever. When you look at all the ingredients on mac and cheese, there'll be a couple of chemical

283
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,570
ingredients in there. Right. And they make this in bulk. So when they get the ingredients delivered,

284
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,930
it comes in these big stainless steel tankers. You've probably seen them on the road, you know.

285
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,190
Sure. And they wear hazmat suits because they're poisonous. So why would you deliberately be adding

286
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:20,910
poisons or time? Yeah, they can be poisonous. Yeah. Toxic chemicals. Right. A refined, highly

287
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,810
refined. You know, it's tough. Well, so what if it acts as a preservative? Right. Actually

288
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,850
handling the product differently. Look, if it needs a preservative, damn, just put it just get

289
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,470
bigger fridges, just charge a little extra because it's in the cold department. Right. Don't put

290
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:43,630
chemicals in it. Right. Like that. So my point here is, again, again, a very basic one. If you

291
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,110
start off with food. Right. And understand that it's energetic, pure energetic. But here's the

292
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,990
thing. How can you get someone who eats mac and cheese and bologna and margarine sandwiches?

293
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,710
Right. To understand that the they're actually it's the energy in the food. Right. Well, what

294
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,690
are they going to get out of that? Right. So, you know, or a standard American diet. Right. Or they

295
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,010
think there's protein. You know, I show people carbohydrate that go to the chemical analysis.

296
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,470
They show you a diagram of the molecule of protein and a molecule of carbohydrate. I said, hold them

297
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,829
up together. They're exactly the same except for one nitrogen. There's no. Why the distinction?

298
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,350
Right. And we're not talking polymer chemistry here. Right. So what I wanted to bring up is

299
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,650
there's a how do you get started in this? And this is very, very basic. Learn to eat something

300
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,890
that is very simple, that is very, very highly charged with energy. And this is the part where

301
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:45,390
it starts to get cultish and like I'm almost being sponsored by them. But if you can get yourself some

302
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,250
Lundberg, it's a brand brown rice. Why? Because it's the only brown rice. Basically, unless you

303
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:59,490
get some from Japan, that's high quality and it's treated very well. What I mean by this is, OK,

304
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,790
they're what's that private radio station, W whatever in New York and YC. Yeah. Yeah. In New

305
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:16,690
York. And they were interviewed once the grandson of Goya Foods. You mean public radio? It's public

306
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,590
radio. That's right. Public radio. It's a Gary knows on there. And he wants to put the network.

307
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,790
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Let's have your back. But, you know, public radio. Yeah. Non-sponsored whatever.

308
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,130
But I remember this because I was doing a restoration project. I was in Manhattan in

309
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,830
the mansion and we were doing the plaster in the gilding and all that to make it look like

310
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:42,930
it did in the eighteen hundreds. And we were working 20 hours a day. And this came on.

311
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,770
And I just leave that on the background. No commercials, no pop music. So there was a recording

312
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:55,570
of the interview of the grandson of Goya Foods, G.O.Y.A. And he said, basically, the reason why

313
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,510
they started Goya Foods is because there was immigrants coming from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican

314
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,710
Republic, living on the East Coast. And they like to eat rice and beans. So they would go to the

315
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,670
grocery store and buy rice and beans. And they found the quality to be inferior. Like, you know.

316
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,970
So they said, we need to do something about this. And it's true. I'm going to. So the Latin people,

317
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,650
when they eat rice and beans. OK, what I mean by this, if you go get a can of Trader Joe's,

318
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,730
let's say, organic black beans, you open the can, you look in there. All the beans are different

319
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:31,210
sizes. Some are broken. Right. Or Kroger or whatever, whatever, quote unquote, white people

320
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:38,670
shopping place. If you get a can of Goya beans and open the lid, all the beans are sized,

321
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,970
they're classified, they're all the same size and there's not one broken bean ever. OK, so you go

322
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:50,510
get rice, whatever white people, rice, American rice, whatever you look at it. You go buy a bag

323
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,970
of new, shaky rice from Japan. You pour. It doesn't matter. I buy it by the twenty five pound bag,

324
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,110
the short grain. You pour out the whole twenty five pound bags. You will not find one broken

325
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:05,730
kernel of rice, piece of rice. They're all whole and they're also the same size. Why?

326
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,950
What does that tell you about the quality? Right. It's kind of like going to a new car dealer and,

327
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,150
you know, you're looking at the cars. I don't want this one. It's the right color,

328
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:20,090
but I don't want it. Why? Because the headlights broken. Right. Well, you know, that's how they

329
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:28,850
come. Oh, my gosh. Right. So, I mean, that's just another way to think about it. So when you buy,

330
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,950
let's say, Nishiki or Lundberg or Goya can of beans or whatever, and you notice or you told

331
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,950
that they're doing this because there are all the grain and all the beans are classified,

332
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:48,770
meaning the same size, not one broken bean or broken piece of rice. Right. It's very clean

333
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:54,550
and all that. What does that tell you? They took extra time. Right. I don't know if you've ever

334
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,970
seen these food processing places, though, but it's basically guys with knee high rubber boots

335
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,770
and jumpsuits and shovels, snow shovels. They dump the food on the ground and they. Right. You said,

336
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,090
yep, you might have seen it. Right. Yes, I have. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you got to rinse all the

337
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:16,330
stuff that's dry, you know, before you cook it. Right. So, yeah. All right. So this is a

338
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,330
qualitative. I'm trying to just lean on that. So get yourself some Lundberg brown rice.

339
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,730
I didn't forget. Came back to it and learn how to cook it. It must be cooked under pressure.

340
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,710
They don't talk about that, really. They just give you a time. You need a good pot with a good

341
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,710
fitting lid. What I like to do is I use Lincoln cookware or all clad. Look it up. Whatever size

342
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,930
six quart is a pretty good pot. Not too big, not too small for court. You know, whenever you work

343
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,670
with a pot, you don't fill it all the way up to the top. You got to give yourself some room. Right.

344
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,610
Yeah. So six quart is a pretty good one. There's like 200 bucks for the pot or whatever you can.

345
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:01,230
Yeah, they don't. You know, rarely you find them on sale, but all clad. OK, what the lid fits,

346
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,350
the lid is a very tight slip fit. It goes down into the pot and it has a shoulder that stops

347
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,250
it from going all the way in. Right. Right. Very, very tight. Same with the Lincoln cookware.

348
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:16,530
Lincoln. I like the pans. I'll try to like the pots. Now, there are a lot of companies that

349
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,530
get yourself a good pot. You also need what's called a heat diffuser. It's like a perforated

350
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:28,370
metal sheet with a handle that you put between the burner and the pot. So when you cook something on

351
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,330
low for a long time, you don't get burn what's on the bottom and you need the pot has to have

352
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,290
a certain amount of thickness. And then you just follow the instructions on the rice. Now, it's

353
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:44,410
not that simple. I'll probably do a solo. I have neglected the solo sonic simply because of what's

354
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:52,410
going on outside of doing sonic events with the water project and other things. It's just a

355
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:58,850
shortage on time. If I tell you I sleep eight hours a week, maybe 12 hours a week. Right. You

356
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,590
know, that's not a lot, but I feel great. I feel great. But how long can you do that for? And no

357
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,810
drugs, by the way. Right. Yeah. No, it depends. Look, if it's working for you, it's working for

358
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,110
you. There are certain time periods I've been in certain time periods where I need a lot of sleep.

359
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,870
I've been in other time periods where I need very little. Yeah. So I'm just super excited. I'm more

360
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:22,590
excited now than I was when I was 12 years old or 30 or whatever. So. OK, so why am I saying this?

361
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,430
OK, so what I did recently was I was saying, you know, I just need to make some food. I just need

362
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,890
to eat some food, but I want it to be really good because the less of it I eat, the better it should

363
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:37,790
be. Right. So what I did is I made some brown rice. It has to be cooked under pressure. I remember in

364
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,490
the chat, someone put in even like a brick wrapped with aluminum foil on the lid to hold it down.

365
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,850
And the reason I say if it's a rock or brick, wrap it with some foil or something, because, you know,

366
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,390
they crumble, the pieces break off, you know. It's like, you know, you serve it and they're like, oh,

367
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,950
this is really crunchy. I mean, yeah. Oh, sorry. I can't tell them why it's so crunchy. Right.

368
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:04,150
But anyway. So, yeah, just be I use diver weights, four pound lead diver weights. Right. And also have

369
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:10,650
a mug that I filled with cement weighs four pounds. But I cut a groove, a half inch by half

370
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,610
inch groove across the mug after it was filled because the pots use a strap handle instead of

371
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,490
a single knob in the middle of the lid. It's a strap that goes across. So the mug. Right.

372
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,830
You can use a pressure cooker. Personally, I think it's the best way to go. But personally,

373
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,410
I think it's I don't like the pressure cookers because they have this rubber gasket that goes

374
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,490
around and I can taste it. It just it smells and tastes like rubber to me. I mean, most people

375
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,430
can't. But when I have something that's cooked in a pressure cooker with rubber gasket, I'm like

376
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:44,910
I can almost taste the rubber, you know. So in Japan, what they do when they pressure cook

377
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,750
certain types of rice, they have the pot machine totally flat. Then they get a thick copper plate

378
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,290
and they weigh it down with buckets of water and things like that. Right. So, yeah, I'm not

379
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,790
suggesting that's not necessary. The copper has an energetic property. Also, the copper plate that

380
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,730
would cover a pot would cost three, four hundred dollars on its own. The all cloud would be almost

381
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,710
as good. OK, so when you make this rice, what I did, I wanted something I kind of meditated on.

382
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:22,730
What would be like super modified, super nitro charged octane boosting body can induce it quickly.

383
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:30,090
It'll be very rejuvenating to the cells. Right. Also, energy, easy to digest. Right. All this

384
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,930
stuff. Right. So, by the way, when I make the rice, I have these I get these these plums. You

385
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,930
know, I've ever had a plum. You know, when plums are not ripe, they're really bitter. You bite into

386
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,770
them like, oh, this needs to ripen. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. There's a type of plum that grows in Asia.

387
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,130
They could be grown here, but they're not. And it's called Umabashi plum.

388
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,830
Umabashi plum. You get them at any Chinese or Asian food market. They have some crazy ingredients

389
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,970
like they use a red coloring, but it's a natural red coloring, some alcohol or stuff or the paste.

390
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,610
But what you do is you put a plum with the with its pit in the rice, in the middle of the rice

391
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,250
before right before you add the water and you cook it with the plum. Why? Because the plum,

392
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,230
the Umabashi plum is world famous for settling digestive. I think on one spot on our fair,

393
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,810
we mentioned I recommended it to you, Chuck. It's world famous for

394
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:32,090
settling digestive issues of any kind, severe and mild. It would be the the most natural,

395
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,530
most effective Pepto-Bismol milk of magnesia or one of those products. Right. What those things

396
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,710
are supposed to do. Yeah. I tried to find that around here. Very difficult where I am. But

397
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,290
but yeah, mail order. It's got mail order, probably. Yep. They're just varieties that

398
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,770
have to be kept in the fridge. And there's varieties that are what do they call them

399
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,650
when they put them in free? They say it's like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't have to be fridged.

400
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,190
You know, I was a trader just once and they had pre-cooked rice on the shelf. It wasn't even in a

401
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,530
it's one of those pouches, vacuum sealed, vacuum sealed pouches. Yeah. They have vacuum seal or

402
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,050
hermetic seal. Yeah. Yeah. Vacuum seal. Right. So why am I saying this? Because I've been playing

403
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,470
around with food for so long and not until recently where I really thought I thought about

404
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,050
this for about a month. What do I need to do to get myself some like super nutrition?

405
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,570
They call them super foods. Right. You see that advertising all the time. Yeah. And I've been

406
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,850
playing with this for a while. And it really, really, really, really works not just with me,

407
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,430
but anyone who tries it because we make the rice this way. Basically, pressure cook Lundberg brown

408
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,070
rice. You can't get Lundberg brown rice. Try to get the best quality you can find.

409
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,370
And cook it with a new bashi plum in a pressure cooker type situation. Right. Now, what I mentioned

410
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:52,050
to people is you can rinse the rice and I'd like to parch it. And parching is as a term. We say

411
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,490
we're parched when we're thirsty, but it's a term. Well, it's a light roast. You know,

412
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,750
there's roasting. Right. Right. When you roast coffee, beans, peanuts or whatever.

413
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,430
But parching is a very light roast. It's like just beginning to roast, just beginning to get

414
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,050
that aroma and you stop. What you do is you rinse the rice. You rinse the rice. You rinse the rice.

415
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,250
Really? Well, you don't have to soak the brown rice. You could. It doesn't matter. It's not going

416
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,410
to get through the husk and let it strain out. And while it's damp, put it in the pot. You're

417
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,610
going to cook it in and go ahead and put the flame on medium and then start lowering it as you're

418
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,050
stirring it. The water will evaporate and then there's no water in the rice as you're stirring

419
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,850
it. You get that beautiful roasted smell. You know, you've smelled things being roasted. It's

420
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,190
just wonderful. Right. It brings the essence out. Right. Absolutely. Yeah. And then when you add

421
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,390
your water, when you add water at that point, add a hot water, have another pot going with twice

422
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,650
the amount of rice. So if you have one cup of rice, two cups of water, that's basically two

423
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,650
and a quarter, maybe water. So then you make your rice. OK, so this is the part where, well,

424
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,990
how is brown rice superfood? Well, it's part of it. I call it brown rice number seven. Right. You

425
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,730
know how the food industry, they name all these things with numbers. Right. Yeah. Right. So I

426
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,950
figured I'd do that, too. So what's the rest of it? Very simple. You got to get yourself some.

427
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,710
Let's start with the one to start with the hard to get vegetables first, Chuck, or the easy to

428
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,650
get vegetables first. Which one? Start with the easy ones. OK. Onion, white onion. Get yourself

429
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,710
some white onion. And when you make the cut on the white onion, by the way, the top of the onion

430
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,550
is the young part of the onion, the part that goes upwards towards the sky and the bottom parts,

431
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,730
the part that goes towards the ground. So when you cut an onion, you want to make it so when

432
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,770
someone gets a piece of onion, they're getting both the top and the bottom at the same time.

433
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,790
So you always cut it vertically. Right. So you cut it in half from top to bottom, lay it down,

434
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,630
take the skin off, whatever, and then go across the side. So when someone gets a piece of onion,

435
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:46,390
they have the top of where the bulb shoots up, the green. And also you also get near the root.

436
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,870
Right. So that's the best way to the flavor is better. Also, that's how you cut your onion.

437
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,190
The next vegetable will be carrot. The way you cut your carrot, cut it on a bias.

438
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,590
So you lay down the carrot. You might want to flatten it a little bit, slice a little bit.

439
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,270
So it's flat. You know, you can just scrub carrots. You don't have to peel them, by the way.

440
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,830
By the way, you know, when you buy potatoes, a lot of people like to peel them. I like that.

441
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,590
You know, they got certain ranch fries and things where it's got the skin on potatoes with skins

442
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,230
and they bake them. They taste good, too. Yeah. When I tell people, you know, I got you wash

443
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:23,090
a lot of stuff that's on potatoes is not dirt. It's not soil. It's human. It's humides. It's

444
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,610
like something that potato. It's like the soil that forms on the potato. Right. It won't hurt you.

445
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,930
It's not dirt. Right. But I would recommend scrubbing them anyway, because if you want to

446
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,650
see how potatoes are handled, you definitely want to wash it. Right. Plus, you don't know what they

447
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,170
came in contact with when they were exactly forwarded, et cetera. So, yeah, I definitely

448
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:45,630
recommend always washing. But don't be totally crazy if you see it's you know, it's got that

449
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,970
little bit of a clay kind of, you know, whatever. It's fine. It's a human. It's humus is what it is.

450
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,830
So one day we'll get into humides and by two minutes, look nights and all that.

451
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:04,250
So anyway, so the carrot, you cut it on a bias, which is an angle. We lay it down and you cut it

452
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,990
like on a. So let's say the carrots about three quarters of an inch in diameter. The piece that

453
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,690
you're going to end up with is going to be almost two inches long because it's on a bias. Right.

454
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,450
OK, you cut that in half again. All right. So now as we're going this way,

455
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,670
those things take less time than the other vegetables cook. So cut them a little thicker.

456
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,150
So actually, in this case, I would cut it about a quarter of an inch thick, no less on the carrot

457
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,890
and no less on the onion. All right. Now we get to the harder to get vegetables.

458
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,890
That would be something called burdock root. Burdock is in the thistle family,

459
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:42,450
and people have heard me extol its virtues before. You know why people eat meat and always

460
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,650
and prefer it? Because when you eat meat, whether it's fish, fowl or beef or whatever,

461
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:53,090
it gives you instant energy. Right. Instant. I mean, like, you know, within not too much life,

462
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,570
you don't get it while you're eating it. You're getting it right after the meal. Right.

463
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,570
That's why you feel that you either feel energetic or you feel strong. One or the other. Yeah,

464
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,690
it does. Yeah. But there's a price to pay later because it's very it could be taxing on the body.

465
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,790
That's why if you had to go somewhere and you had to be on the move for a long time,

466
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,170
you need a bag of dried fruit and some beef jerky and a water source, and you'd be good for days

467
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:25,990
just with a few ounces of that right beef jerky and some dried fruit in a pouch and a water source

468
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,830
from your water source. You could have, let's say, like eight ounces of that and go for a week.

469
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:35,430
That's how concentrated it is. But you'll have a hangover after a few days of eating that right

470
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:41,090
because of the way that it distributes the energy. OK, so in this case, the burdock root,

471
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,910
it does what meat does because it's the most young. It's the most bracing. It's the tightest

472
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,170
vegetable known. It's basically in the thistle root. And people that are into, let's say,

473
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,550
alternative healing and stuff will know that if someone has liver issues, they recommend milk

474
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:01,290
thistle. All right. You've heard of that. Yeah. And basically everyone, anybody that has most

475
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:07,110
like skin rashes, allergies, diabetes of any kind, you know what that is? That's a liver issue.

476
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,690
That's a liver dysfunction, by the way. Right. Right. Yes. Yes. Allergies or liver dysfunctions,

477
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:21,770
guys. Yeah. Wow. So. OK, so this is very bracing and strengthening in many, many ways because the

478
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,890
thistle family burdock root also cut it on the bias and that I would cut on like a 16th of an

479
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,730
inch, make it thin. Right. So let's say the burdock is a half inch to three quarter wide

480
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,410
a diameter. When you make your slice, it'll be, again, about two inches long, like it'll look

481
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:42,010
like an ellipse right on a bias. OK, what's the next vegetable? Next vegetable is taro root.

482
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:48,070
Now, you'll find that mostly in mountainous. It's a mountain. Now, there's two types of taro root

483
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:54,970
is large root and small root. Use the large root. Right. OK. It has more flavor. It looks like a very

484
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,230
white. You know how potatoes are white, but they're not really white. They're yellow. You

485
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,450
know, kind of right. Well, taro root is chalk white, like blackboard chalk white. That's how

486
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,310
white it is. Right. It's got a very dark skin. Yes. Super white. And it has little blue or purple

487
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:14,150
hairs throughout the starch. OK, now that one you want to cut the thickest, peel it and just

488
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:19,570
cut a slice of it about a half inch or more and then cut it into smaller pieces like you would,

489
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:24,770
let's say, potatoes. Right. I don't think I've ever had this. I mean, it's delicious. Yeah.

490
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:30,630
I mean, where would you find that available? You find that in a lot of South American culture and

491
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,550
Asian culture. They it goes both ways. It goes for savory dishes and for desserts.

492
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:42,449
It would be if you lived in a Latin neighborhood or Asian neighborhood, it would be more common

493
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,210
than the potato, the potatoes that we call, you know, it's a root. It's a mountain starch root.

494
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,810
OK, OK. You can get it's delicious. Actually, you know what I was addicted to about a few decades

495
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,410
ago is taro chips. Do you remember those? I never saw them. You never. Oh, OK. Yeah,

496
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,450
he was kind of all the rage. I know there's a bunch of people who had them and they are delicious.

497
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,590
Right. And it's not like it's a very broad flavor. Yeah. Lots of different chips became popular at

498
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,490
different points. There was all sorts of different chips, chips, sweet potato chips.

499
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,870
Chips were a big thing for a bit. Remember, those were a big thing. Which one? Banana chips,

500
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,150
believe it or not. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. That started in the 80s. Yeah. Right. That's what

501
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,290
I'm thinking back to is the banana chips. And then all of a sudden there was all these different

502
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,150
types of first time I saw what they call deli chips or kettle chips all of a sudden. And yeah,

503
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,290
right. Right. And then I have I have enough plastic teeth in the mouth that I got to be careful if I

504
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:41,770
try to bite on something like that. But all right. OK, so the terror. OK, we got that. All right.

505
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,370
The next one, we're going to get really strange lotus root. It's the lotus plant. What does it

506
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:53,250
look like? It kind of looks like those Yukon gold potatoes. But when you and it comes in there in

507
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,950
pods, sometimes it's four or five minute pod looks like something, you know, in Star Trek,

508
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,390
they try to make like alien looking food and vegetables. Right. It looks like something

509
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:07,450
out of Star Trek, but neutral in color. If you cut a section of the lotus root,

510
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:14,990
it looks identical to the bronchi bronchi in the lung, in the lungs. Look up cross section

511
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,310
of lotus root. I don't know if you can do that, Chuck. I don't know if they'll mess up our recording.

512
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,650
No, no, I won't. I'll go ahead to cross section of the bronchi bronchi in the lungs and do a

513
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,230
cross section of the lotus root. And tell me if you see any difference at all. And the answer is no.

514
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,790
So guess what? The lotus root is good for. Right. Energetically, in other words, the energy that

515
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,770
takes to form the lotus root is the identical energy that it takes to form the bronchi in the

516
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:46,750
lungs. So they complement. Right. Right. I'm just sorry. I'm getting the bronchial tube up and

517
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,270
the bronchi. Yeah. Which are the little sacks, bronchi sacks. Yeah.

518
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:57,070
Cross section or cross section of lung would be an easy one. Oh, cross. You know what? Yeah.

519
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,010
Cross section lung. OK, that's easier. Yeah. Cross section lung and then do cross section

520
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,730
of lotus root. OK, got it. I type real slow, but I'm getting it. Yeah.

521
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,350
Yeah. So all these are these are based. They all they're all have their own very distinct flavor.

522
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,890
But this is pure energetic. This is like formulating a synthetic oil for a race engine is what I'm

523
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:26,030
talking about. Right. You notice I said race engine. Right. Right. So, yeah. Well, there's

524
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,650
a cross section of the root. And yeah, you see what it looks like. Go even without looking at

525
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,270
the lungs. I mean, familiar with sort of the structure. Look at the lungs and you'll see

526
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,730
it's identical in proportion and everything. Yeah. That's it's just a little more symmetrical.

527
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,610
Looks like in the in the root. Yeah, but it's identical in proportion. You know,

528
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,850
this is the amount of cells to the proportion of the body of the root to the bronchi.

529
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,170
Yeah. It's just laid out in a more organized pattern in the root from the pictures.

530
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:59,630
Yeah. As far as I've noticed, roots tend to be more organized than most people as well. Yeah.

531
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,490
Yeah. OK, there we go. You see that? Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? OK.

532
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:10,310
The last thing is ginger root. Slice that real thin. It doesn't have to be on a bias. Just go

533
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,570
across. Peel it. And less than an eighth of an inch. And you could do Juliana like matchsticks.

534
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,370
Right. There's two options here. One is to put it in with the rice, all these veg in

535
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:27,990
with the rice as you're as you're parching the rice, because you always want to saute

536
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,910
vegetable dry a little bit to bring till it caramelizes. That's where you get the wonderful

537
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:37,010
flavor. Right. You don't have to do that. I suggest doing that now with the ginger. Is the

538
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,630
ginger more about flavor or is that more about? No, no. OK, no. I kind of skipped over that.

539
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:47,710
I didn't get over where the energy of the taro root that much either. OK. And the ginger root

540
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:54,350
is is a very it gives off the strong aroma of something you would imagine as being very

541
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,510
expansive. But its structure is extremely contractive and it's a root. OK. Any kind

542
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,550
of root vegetable, by the way, is bracing anything that is a root is bracing. What

543
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,810
do I mean by bracing? I was just going to hear about people like they haven't eaten

544
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,110
and they say, I got the shakes. Oh, yeah. OK, well, if you eat this kind of food and

545
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,250
you haven't eaten and you're really hungry, you'll never get the shakes. You still feel

546
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,870
stable. And if you don't, you know, you don't hear people say my blood sugar is low. Right.

547
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:25,810
Oh, you eat this. You eat this kind of food. You don't have that feeling. The hypoglycemia.

548
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,710
Which way it goes too much or too little. OK, so the taro root, though, just to jump

549
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,190
back on the energy and then they'll do the ginger root. The taro root is does everything

550
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,950
a simple starch does without being a simple starch. OK, if you're in a race or a marathon

551
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,050
or whatever, you're running out of energy. You need a simple starch right now to boost

552
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:50,650
you. Right. To get some energy. Right. Chocolate bar, energy bar, energy drink. Right. It does

553
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,710
that, but it does very much what that would do as a simple starch. Very easy to digest.

554
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,230
But it's not a simple starch. It's actually has a lot of minerals. It's also good for

555
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,150
chitin in the body, which is hair and nails. Now, the ginger root has got a very strong

556
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,570
peppery aroma, which was in the vernacular that I like to lean on. It would be make it

557
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:16,210
very lean, but it's very young. In other words, if you feel a ginger, it's really tight. You

558
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,250
throw a ginger root across the room and someone on the head, it's that knob is going to hurt

559
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,590
their head. It's hard. Yeah, it's very hard and very fibrous, extremely fibrous, believe

560
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:29,210
it or not. You'll see if you start slicing it. If you try grinding it, you have to do

561
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,990
a slice because the fibers get in the way. Right. OK. And also you could tell by the

562
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:41,010
segments on its skin. Right. How it grows is also giving a tremendous amount of energy

563
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,370
and then it stops growing and then it gives us tremendous amount of energy. So what the

564
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:51,110
ginger does is it aids recovery. Right. You know what I mean? Like you make an effort

565
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:56,210
and you got to recover to make another effort. The ginger will help in shortening the recovery

566
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:04,590
time, whatever that might be. OK, so this is all very much put together. By the way,

567
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,190
the burdock root, the carrot. Yeah, it's good for your eyes. You know why? If you cut a carrot

568
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,830
across the just straight across and you hold it up next to your eye. Yeah, it's just like

569
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:18,930
the eyeball. Same proportion. Right. Yeah. The concentric. Right. Right. And so all these

570
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:23,710
things have energy, energetic patterns, and they all work very well together. So back

571
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,890
to cooking it. If you think you have enough finesse to put it in with the rice and cook

572
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,130
it, you'll probably end up with the rice being too crunchy and raw. The vegetables will be

573
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,170
overdone. Why? Because the vegetables have moisture in them and it will not let the water

574
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,890
get hot enough. They act as a cooling. So what I recommend doing, even though it is a pressure

575
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,730
cooking situation, is cook the rice three quarters of the way, half hour or 25 minutes.

576
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:54,010
Let the pressure out. Add the vegetables, stir them in and add just a little bit extra water

577
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,990
and then bring it up to a high heat and a medium heat with your heat diffuser and finish the

578
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,830
cook. It'll probably be an hour when it's all said and done instead of 45 minutes.

579
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,010
So now you have this number seven rice that is a superfood. Literally, it works really,

580
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:14,390
really well. If you have a sensitive bowel and you're not good at chewing, you will know that

581
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,510
you have a sensitive bowel because you're not good at chewing. Right. I always recommend when people

582
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:24,730
do brown rice to make it a little soggy in the beginning, a little mushier until they get used

583
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,930
to it. Why the rice? Why? Well, some people say, oh, it's too much carbohydrate. No, it's not.

584
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,050
It's actually a whole food. Why am I leaning on this so much? And why are we putting a sonic

585
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,830
event on this? Because I'm so impressed with the performance of it in the body in terms of the

586
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:46,930
amount of energy that it gives. And this is not just like a recipe. I gave all of the ingredients

587
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,090
and the reasons why they work together and how they work together. And the more you understand

588
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,870
the induction principle in the body, the more you will see what's going on here, especially when you

589
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:02,410
try it. Right. If you have conditions known as whatever the C word or whatever, or you can't

590
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:08,610
recover or quote unquote health issues, chronic stuff, and you incorporate this into your diet

591
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,110
and then disincorporate your other diet and eat more of this, you will watch those manifestations

592
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:19,390
disappear. Usually, usually in most cases, but experiments with people and myself, something

593
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,090
chronic comes up like a dry spot or something, you know, like, oh, look, I'm getting older.

594
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,470
This dry spot here means it's too much eating and the body's blocking it. Right. So when I start

595
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,330
eating this way, it disappears completely. And we're talking about a chronic thing that

596
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:36,630
was been around for two, three, four, five years. You tried all kinds of ointments and stuff like

597
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,370
that. It doesn't really work, but you do this and it disappears. What does that mean? Right.

598
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,650
The energy. Yeah. Flowing commonly the dry elbows. Right. I mean, that's one of the first things that

599
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,290
always happens with the dry elbows. Yeah. That has nothing to do with dry elbows. It's a manifestation.

600
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,870
Right. Right. Well, it does. Well, it's a dry elbow. What do you mean? Does nothing to dry

601
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,610
to dry elbows, a dry elbow. Right. I know. But I'm just saying it's a manifestation.

602
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,470
Once you start. So what I've discovered is I'm able to sleep very little and eat very little.

603
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:10,890
And I feel totally satiated with this. Now, I wanted to go back to how I started taking care

604
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,790
of the most basic things in your life, starting off with food. I've got we've gone into the hygiene

605
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:23,530
quite a bit, too. Right. To a degree, which is actually simple, you know, washing. You know,

606
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,550
I talked about how the body demagnetizes right when you bathe or shower. Right. Whenever people

607
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,110
aren't feeling well, the first thing I say is take a shower, take a bath and let me know how

608
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:38,070
you feel after that. And you know what? Ninety percent of the time I feel a lot better. Right.

609
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,630
So because it demagnetizes the body literally, you know. You know what? Put it this way. Let's

610
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,570
go to the simple boy electrician stuff. If you're holding a live wire, standing in a puddle of water,

611
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,990
what do you think is going to happen? Well, versus not standing in a puddle of water,

612
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,530
your chances of getting hit pretty hard in the puddle of water increase. Right.

613
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:02,790
So water has something to do with electricity, maybe. Right. Yeah. Is the body electric,

614
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:09,010
you know? So yeah. So imagine condition, energetic condition building up in the body and you jump in

615
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,850
the shower, take a bath or whatever. You're fully grounded. The water running over your body.

616
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,110
What what's it going to do to that field that you had built up in the body? So wash it away.

617
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,610
Well, that condition is going to change radically. Right. All right. So, yeah, that's just that's the

618
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,330
beyond the hygiene part. So the reason I'm saying this is I've had discussions recently with people

619
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:34,810
that everyone's got their own specific thing for being here on this earth, what they like and what

620
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:40,350
they don't like. And when I listen to it, I'm like, yeah, but how do you eat? Are you eating

621
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,950
good food? Do you know about hygiene? Do you know about how the body really works? So when you're

622
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:51,290
when you see like everybody around, you say, oh, take this mangosteen. Your body absorbs it. It's

623
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,370
full. What are you going to say? You're going to go along with that or you're going to call

624
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:58,090
bullshit at somebody. Right. So I mean, do you know how your body really works? Do you know?

625
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,750
Right. So I found that most people that I've interacted with, we're talking about an industry

626
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,950
to these are, you know, OK, and all kinds of all levels. I'm like, they don't know how to eat.

627
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,190
They don't know how to keep themselves clean. They don't know how we're right. They get easily,

628
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,190
easily swayed in direct, you know, especially with health stuff. Right.

629
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:24,230
So, you know, I don't want to get cancer. Well, then keep the energy in your body moving. Well,

630
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:29,010
I don't believe that. Haven't they, at least for the past 20 years, for sure,

631
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,290
they've been trying to teach or put in people's minds that cancer is hereditary.

632
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,450
Right. Oh, yeah. That's another thing. Oh, my gosh. Your family history, your family history. That's

633
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:43,350
what they do. Yeah. Heavily leaning on that. It was an actress. She got her boobs cut off just

634
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:48,530
because she thought she might get cancer or something. Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. That

635
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,610
was what he called it. She was with Angela Jolie. Jolie. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if

636
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,410
it's true or not, but I mean, putting that out in public is just freaking embarrassing. Well,

637
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:01,930
she said it. I don't know if she did it, but she said, yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is this stuff is

638
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,670
criminal. But here's the thing. Like I've had a discussion with an attorney general once and he

639
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:12,230
didn't. Obviously, he knew that I knew law and he didn't. Right. Yeah. Basically, the conversation

640
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:17,210
ended up with, you know, we get into that. We just put you in jail. He didn't know any law at all.

641
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,830
So their answer is, we'll put you in jail. We'll just put you in jail. And he could do it. He'd

642
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,850
make a phone call and put you in jail. Right. Oh, no reason. Of course. Right. So this is how

643
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,350
they're operating. This is how everything's operating right now. They're not operating

644
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:33,650
by by what they say they are. So why did I bring up this long thing on the sonic event about the

645
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,870
food and actually gave out the recipe? If anyone has any more specific questions on it, I will

646
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:44,610
answer. The most problem that I found with people living in, let's say, the Midwest or maybe even

647
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:50,230
where you are, Chuck, you may not be able to get the ingredients. That's OK. Just make it what you

648
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:55,230
can get. Right. And but here's the other thing. There's no substitute for lotus root because you

649
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,170
can use taro root for potato, but it's going to make a mess. So there's no substitute for the

650
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:04,930
taro. There's no substitute for the ginger. There might be like Galangal looks like ginger, smells

651
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,030
like ginger or turmeric root, but doesn't have the qualities. It's too strong on us. Right. You

652
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:14,170
see those these things I've been. This is this has been like masterly crafted. There's no substitute

653
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,930
for any of these things that I mentioned. Well, I experimented with to America. I don't think it's

654
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:23,350
a bad thing at all. No, but it won't do what the ginger does. It leans too much on one side.

655
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,270
That's why it's turmeric. OK, but you know what I'm saying? It looks just like ginger root,

656
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,210
right? It's pretty similar. So does Galangal. But Galangal just tastes like white pepper.

657
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,990
Doesn't have any as a very strong. It's very, very strong flavor.

658
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,730
So, yeah. So there's no substitute for these things. I mean, let's say you don't have carrots.

659
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,190
Actually, it's hard to say carrot. You can't find carrots and onions because that's probably the most

660
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,330
common thing you can get. Right. Carrots and onions, you should be able to find anywhere

661
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,870
in the United States for sure. Yeah. So you start off with that if that's all you can get.

662
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,710
Right. But what I'm suggesting, this is like on a master. What I'm giving you is a master level,

663
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:06,370
super modified, super food type combination. And prove me wrong that this doesn't help you

664
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:10,870
recover and rejuvenate your body. Just tell me you tried it and it didn't do anything for you.

665
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:15,090
It won't. It's incredible. I've been playing around with this and thinking about this for a

666
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,650
very, very long time, and I've been doing it recently. And I'm like, this works so well.

667
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,450
I got to tell other people, you know, and once you get that and hygiene, a few other things

668
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:29,270
together, you can have a completely different outlook on the way you think your outlook is now.

669
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,590
Absolutely. And again, if it begins with that. Right. You know, look, some of the old

670
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,390
adages make sense. Right. What you eat, you are what you eat. Well, kind of because

671
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:45,110
it does begin a lot of what you're going to be dealing with later. I mean,

672
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,250
but that's the point. Later, as we're getting into what we're getting into,

673
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:55,410
we're getting hit with more energetic stuff than ever. We're not just direct energy weapons and

674
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:00,790
the multiple, you know, the force multiplier of Wi-Fi everywhere. Right. You know what?

675
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,470
We talked about Wi-Fi 20 years ago and talk about it now. It's what? Maybe 100 times more

676
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:11,130
Wi-Fi everywhere. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. And also cosmically, you know, some believe,

677
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,670
you know, people that are sensitive, they say the sun we have now is not the same sun we had 10

678
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,730
years ago. Right. That's true. You know, I've been observing the astronomical bodies. They look

679
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:24,430
very different because the atmosphere, everything's changing. So we need to humans are inherently

680
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:30,050
robust creatures, but we need to be even more robust now just to just to think clearly what

681
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:35,130
it took to, let's say, improve your body so you could have clear thinking. Let's say 20 years ago,

682
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:40,070
you need to do five times more now. Right. I can tell you this. Look, I've been alive. You know,

683
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,230
what they say is 50, 50 plus years. And I can guarantee you this much in the past 10 years,

684
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,770
I've been able to feel not necessarily identify everything that's happening,

685
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:56,190
but I'm certain that there is a lot more action going on in the unseen world energetically in the

686
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,470
past 10 years than in the previous 40 without question. Yeah. Yeah. But but energetically,

687
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:07,050
not in the woo woo happy, you know, airy, fairy side copy, but in the like the way your body

688
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:12,390
can recover and health issues and things like that. Yeah. Things are more intense, more oppressive.

689
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,250
The weight is heavier on you. You know what I mean? That's the way I interpret it. It's probably

690
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:22,070
not proper, but I mean, I definitely feel the difference in the past 10 years. And it's not

691
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:27,190
just me getting older. There is more happening. Yeah. Yeah. You can sense it. It's the easiest

692
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:32,150
time to sense it is right before going to sleep and waking up. You'll you'll notice. Right. Because

693
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,770
when you're unconscious and sleep, it's kind of shuts you down. Yeah. It's so I just I just wanted

694
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,110
to share that today. I hope people find it valuable. You'll find it extremely valuable if you

695
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:48,110
do it. And I hope you can find the ingredients. And if you have to go a little extra, it's worth

696
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,670
it. And I'd like to some feedback from it, because the difference between this dish

697
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:58,350
is just I'm talking basic sustenance now, which you just had to create basic sustenance and

698
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,990
something that, again, aids in recovery, rejuvenation, energy, digestion, all that stuff.

699
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:10,070
This this would be it. And I am a foodie and a food Nazi. But this is something that lies in

700
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,290
between everything. And it does taste good. And don't be afraid if you make this to put

701
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:18,330
condiments on it, any condiment you like. Yeah, I was going to ask about, you know what

702
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:22,630
with variations. But, you know, all these other things coming together, it seems pretty well

703
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:27,290
balanced. And I mean, I'm imagining it. I haven't actually experienced it, but it's a it's a pretty

704
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:35,830
sound idea. So I like it. One of these days I might ask you about mushrooms, but not that's

705
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:42,630
not green, doesn't have seeds. Mushrooms are. They still can't figure out if mushrooms are

706
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,830
animal or vegetable or mineral or what they are. You know, right. It sounds strange,

707
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,730
right? They're mushrooms. They're in their own class. I'm an Old Testament kind of guy. And I

708
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:58,830
loosely or no, I strictly interpret the loose explanation that your food shall be green and

709
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:05,290
have bare seeds. I take that loose description and I use it strictly. So do mushrooms are

710
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:10,170
mushrooms green and do they bear seeds, have a seed bearing structure? The answer is no.

711
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,910
It's like, you know, pumpkin is a fruit. Right. Right. Because it has a seed bearing structure.

712
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:22,590
Right. As like fruit does. Right. So, yeah. Yeah. So but do what you got to do. You know,

713
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,750
I've in some cases, some people have some conditions that I might have to put together

714
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:32,350
of something like cockroaches. So that's another story. Right.
