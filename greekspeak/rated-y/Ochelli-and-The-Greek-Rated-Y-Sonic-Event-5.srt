1
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,980
Number 5, Sonic Event, Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y.

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,660
I am Ocelli, alright, that's all you really need to know about me.

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,160
What do we know about the Greek?

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,560
Well, you know, as you listen, perhaps you learn about him, perhaps you don't.

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,060
Perhaps you just get other rarefied information.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,740
And you know, there's been some stuff in the chat lately, Greek, that is going to be part

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,140
of what is discussed today.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,100
I'll leave that to you to decide where it is we go with it, but could be a really interesting

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,600
interaction.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,420
And if you are listening to this, you're obviously subscribed to Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y,

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,880
but you may not have noticed the little chat box, which you can participate in, even anonymously

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,160
if you choose to, and it is there.

13
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:12,020
We're not running it, but we do have administrative privileges in there, so be sensible about

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,900
your communications in there, and enter your thoughts about what it is you're hearing.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,780
Okay, now I've done enough of an ad for something that we don't need to do an ad for.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,400
Greek, how are you doing today?

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,540
Yeah, good.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,820
I could tell you I'm slightly anonymous myself.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,000
I go as the Greek, but look, this is what I do.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,960
I did find out I'm the only Greek I know.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,160
So that's a good thing at this point.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,840
But yeah, the chat's been very good.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,700
Everything's been very civil, in air quotes, and we knew it would be, because when you

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,300
do things the way we're doing them now, they're going to end up better.

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,440
So yeah, look, this is Sonic 5, which is an odd number.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
People don't like talking about the number 5.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,920
They talk about 6 as being whatever, and 7 as being whatever, but 5 is kind of odd.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,860
It's also the number that comes right before man comes on the scene symbolically on the

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,620
spiritual realm.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,280
So being odd-

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,620
Interesting thing about number 5, though, is that people do work in 5s, right?

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,220
I mean, denominations of money almost always have 5s involved in the equation.

33
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,240
5 is a fairly good collection of something where you don't have a couple, which is 2,

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,780
and you don't have a few, which is 3.

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,180
You do have a grouping of something now, and significantly, I think the 5th Sonic element

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,960
means now there's a significant grouping of this series.

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,600
How about that?

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,300
Yeah, and also, well, look, odd numbers promote odd groupings.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,700
Let's say you're buying terminals or things that comp light bulbs or anything that you

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,480
want to get in pairs.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,600
Sometimes they'll sell it to you in an odd number, like 3 or 5, or like batteries or whatever.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,700
So if you need an even number, you've got to buy an entire new package, right?

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah, true.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
You notice that's being done in marketing?

45
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,440
But what's interesting about here-

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Most devices ask you to use 2 or multiples of 2, so it's an even number usually, right?

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,480
Yeah, well, it's like I'm buying electronic parts and their terminals, which are positive,

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,760
negative, just even numbers, but they'll sell you an odd number, so you have to get an-

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,620
Anyway, but no selling here.

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
Here's the thing.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,380
Being odd, referring back to the chat, let's just get right to business.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,740
Cloning has come up, and I've brought it up, and I want to discuss that, and I can discuss

53
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:36,460
stuff, not just what people discuss when they spend too much time on the internet, but little

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,320
clues and cues and things, and I'll give a little more history on how I found it to be

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,760
very plausible and what is mostly available, but also it's mostly twisted.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,440
You cannot discuss cloning without discussing things that are held in secret, but shown

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,580
to the public as something else.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,620
Well, is that due to the fact, though, that there is a guaranteed spiritual element to

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:10,220
this, as well as the scientific and the supposedly secular, moralistic considerations?

60
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,200
I mean, is it because it crosses so many boundaries?

61
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,200
It's not something that can be relegated only to the spiritual and only to the scientific

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,260
and only to the political, et cetera, et cetera?

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,760
I mean, is that the reason why it's not really discussed in a serious fashion in most places?

64
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,820
I mean, even when you go to some of these publications where they're supposed to, it

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,300
seems like, eh, look, surface level, here you go.

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
I don't know.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,880
Is that it?

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,100
Yeah.

69
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,500
Well, you know the Swiss Army approach.

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,780
It's the one little thing that does multiple things, but you can't use it as the main

71
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,420
tool, right?

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:43,820
Right.

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,780
But the Swiss Army approach is, there's always a spiritual component to anything, but

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,940
the main overarching Swiss Army application of the spiritual component is the overarching

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,820
spiritual aspect that there is a controlling body on the earth that is here to prevent

76
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,400
or implement methods and whatever in society where people never, will never, that's in

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,160
a sense, will never realize who they really are or what they're capable of.

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,480
That is the overarching spiritual element to anything, is that whether you want to look

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,500
at religion, look at what organized religions do, right?

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,580
Look at what science does, right?

81
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,780
Everything's materialistic.

82
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,620
All of the spiritual components to almost any subject in this incarnation, in this era,

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,500
this age, is to prevent people from understanding what they're capable of.

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,760
And it goes all the way down to the conversations.

85
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,660
How many times have you heard, that was a really, I can't have a decent conversation,

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,480
right?

87
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,560
Well, that is the result of this spiritual element, which is basically to present people

88
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,260
with, let's say, funneling into the lower aspect of what they really are versus what

89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,520
they can be.

90
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,460
That's the overarching part of it.

91
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,960
It's funny, I'm starting to hear this sentiment now, and not quite articulated exactly as

92
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,060
you did just now, but I'm starting to hear it from some others who do seem to have some

93
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,860
level of awareness about the game being played.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,060
I mean, let's be honest here.

95
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
There's an anti-human agenda.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,300
It is certainly being run by a group of conspirators, okay?

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,960
And the thing is, realistically, the actual, you know, the big players, right, the high

98
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,100
rollers in this casino, are unseen.

99
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,420
They are unknown.

100
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,280
Their names are not publicized.

101
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,840
They're not on the idiotic rectangles.

102
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,980
They're not there.

103
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,740
You don't see them.

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,940
You do see their works, but you don't see them.

105
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,340
Yeah, and they never have been seen, by the way.

106
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,220
There's references, like you've heard of the Magi class and all that.

107
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,060
Even that's a little too much.

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,960
You know, people do research on the Magi, and the reason I bring that up is because

109
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,800
it goes back a long time.

110
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, you know, we discussed recently, if you've heard their name, seen their face,

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,660
heard their voice or whatever, they're just a front puppet or a front man.

112
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,600
They're not the ones calling the shots.

113
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,480
But they do have some power.

114
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,600
So let's say, you know, the local authority, who's a puppet, wherever you might be, and

115
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,480
the lower, the less they have to administer, actually, the more, less of a puppet they

116
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,640
are.

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,680
Like, so for example, if you talk about the U.S., the worst puppet is the president.

118
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,440
And then as you go down, then it's the vice president and speaker of the house, your

119
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,260
main senators and main congressmen.

120
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,860
But as you go lower down to something called assemblymen, which are even lower than a

121
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,960
congress, they are pretty free.

122
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,980
They're not that manipulated, believe it or not.

123
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,280
Right?

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,240
Yeah, they can show up like once a week or once a month.

125
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,220
Yeah, they're not that important because it's kind of like, you know, there's a

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,380
biblical thing where the ruler of thousands, ruler of hundreds, and the rulers of tens.

127
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Right?

128
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,060
So the tens would be very local.

129
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,240
Hundreds would be, let's say, on a state level.

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,900
The ruler of thousands would be on, say, a federal level, which I don't like that

131
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,140
word.

132
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,260
Anyone look up the word federal.

133
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,640
What it means is that you, it's a religious term.

134
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,580
Right?

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:21,280
So, but anyway, the aspect of today's discussion is that when we say something very

136
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,040
simple like, let's discuss cloning on this.

137
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,120
You really can't without discussing, let's say, nuclear agenda, the general propaganda

138
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,140
on society, the faceless unseen enemy threat, all of that.

139
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,580
And I want to get into some detail.

140
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,520
And the thing is, this is often discussed on the web, but I want to bring it from the

141
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,320
angle that we do.

142
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,940
And, and how it's actually knowledge of what we're going to be discussing of it

143
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,960
actually can be useful.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,560
What do you think?

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,520
Oh, absolutely.

146
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,280
I think that over and over again, it is a repeatable.

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,320
It is a constant, even that there are, well, an array of invisible enemies, so to

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,000
speak, invisible.

149
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,180
Some of them imagined some of them quite not imaginary at all, but all equally

150
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,660
invisible.

151
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,420
I mean, even.

152
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,960
Well, here, look, I want to interject this step on you just for a second.

153
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,300
Let's go to the end.

154
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,160
You know, like sometimes I tell people, give me the important part first.

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,760
Let's say you're making a cell phone call and someone says, Hey, I got to tell you

156
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:18,960
something.

157
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,580
It's really important.

158
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,580
And then you lose, lose battery power or lose connection.

159
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,760
You didn't get anything.

160
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,140
But if you say the, the, the important part first and then tell them that was

161
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,700
really important.

162
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,400
Did you get that?

163
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,680
You see?

164
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,660
So this is the most important part.

165
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,020
And this is just analogous again with the invisible enemy and however it was

166
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,100
originally, let's say it was a threat from another country or an ideology.

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,560
It was the communist, the Nazis or the Arab terrorists.

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,140
And then it becomes more and more invisible.

169
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,860
Ultimately, even as simple as the next tribe, you know, the, the tribes that

170
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,320
will come from outside of the area, you've never seen them before, but

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,680
they're coming.

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Little green men from Mars or whatever.

173
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,780
We'll cover that too.

174
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,740
So, so, but here's the ultimate thing.

175
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm just going to give the important part here before we even get into the

176
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,120
whole sonic is once what's past the embassy, we went from a uniform or

177
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,340
ethnicity or something to identify to something you cannot identify.

178
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,920
And it could be anywhere like a 1984 type thing.

179
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,840
It could be anywhere, anyone, where does that lead to?

180
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,640
Here's the simple analogy.

181
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,240
And they've been putting this out for a while now, and this is what it's

182
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,860
going to lead to.

183
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
You've heard of the climate change, right?

184
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Sure.

185
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Okay.

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,220
And they're saying that it's manmade.

187
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,500
Ultimately it has nothing to do with climate change or carbon or anything

188
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,020
like that.

189
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,960
It has to do with making you the enemy because they're blaming it on you.

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,920
So ultimately you go from an enemy identifiable one unseen to one

191
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,180
invisible unidentifiable.

192
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,400
And it always ends up as you are the enemy.

193
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,980
And when you are the enemy in any, in an organism at war with itself is doomed.

194
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,040
And it's not only a war with itself on a familial or local level, but in

195
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,120
eternally, you see.

196
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,140
It's to the point where I can't take it anymore.

197
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm going to go jump off a tall building or cut my wrists or blow my head off.

198
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,480
That's the ultimate goal of this, self-destruction.

199
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,540
Okay.

200
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,500
So when you hear climate change and they're blaming it on everyone, your

201
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,260
activities, you know, your carbon footprint, the next step is that you are

202
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,660
the enemy and we don't have to give you a reason anymore.

203
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,480
So end it now, right?

204
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,680
You see, this is a, basically it's the old Mission Impossible self-destruct

205
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,660
tape, right?

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,700
This tape will self-destruct in 30 seconds is the agenda, self-destruction.

207
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay.

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,940
So that's the most important crux of this.

209
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,860
So let's get into it.

210
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,420
Coning.

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,620
Yeah, strategically it's sensible, by the way, because, look, if you have an

212
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,280
enemy that you can never escape because you are it, guess what?

213
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,340
Eventually exhaustion will set in.

214
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,920
Fatigue will take its toll.

215
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,940
So there you go.

216
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,380
You just blow yourself up and your problems will go away, right?

217
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,700
That's what the climate change is about.

218
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,140
Well, that's why the people basically become the enemy with these political

219
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,740
things, which are, again, more.

220
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,760
Well, we'll talk about that, what the politics really are.

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,560
I know everybody knows it's bullshit, but there's another thing there.

222
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,800
Let's get into cloning.

223
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Sure.

224
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,740
Let's jump into it.

225
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,660
Okay.

226
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,280
Well, everybody's got the sense of what that means, right?

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,800
A copy.

228
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,080
But, you know, nature, there's a guy, Oshi or someone, some guru, he said

229
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,740
that nature doesn't make carbon copies.

230
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,280
And it's true.

231
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,080
That's why, for example, when something is cloned, with basic scientific

232
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,860
analysis, they could tell if the cell is an original or it's a clone based

233
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,380
on certain proteins that are present.

234
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,640
And I've been looking into this for a little while because I'm doing some

235
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,680
research on biopolymers, in other words, like plastics that are not made from

236
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,120
petroleum, but using more natural plant based materials, right?

237
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,660
So for structural stuff.

238
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,660
So I'm kind of like in a project with that for a little while because the

239
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,140
biggest problem with making biopolymers is making them chemical and water

240
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,920
resistant, right?

241
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:05,180
So if we go back to the cloning concept, first of all, I want to say that the

242
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,800
powers that be from the cosmic rule, they invented science fiction back in

243
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
the 30s, 40s.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,700
I mean, yes, science fiction goes back to the 1890s, right?

245
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,140
They invented that to sort of put these thoughts in people's heads so the

246
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,600
thought was there, whether it's to be, let's say you have the white hat, the

247
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
positive part of the elite that say we want to help humanity.

248
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,660
We can't say this.

249
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,000
How many times have you heard someone publishing a book on something and

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,140
they'll say, the publisher will come back and say, we don't want to publish

251
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,140
it, but if you want to publish it as fiction, we'll publish it, right?

252
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,420
It's very simple.

253
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,720
The cosmic rule is once you're aware of an idea because of what's possible,

254
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,120
it doesn't matter if it's fiction category or fact.

255
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,560
You are made aware of that idea.

256
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,680
That's what matters.

257
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,100
So in science fiction, which I call disclosure, we've seen, let's say,

258
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,960
enough about cloning.

259
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,020
So we're not going to really go down that aspect.

260
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,280
What I want to do, maybe start out with when you start getting involved in

261
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,900
things that whether you hear about it or read about it and you say, that's

262
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,220
interesting.

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,940
I have enough free time to engage it.

264
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,120
A lot of people do that with Tesla technology and other things like that,

265
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,880
Victor Schauberger less so, but they get into little science projects if you

266
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,860
have the wherewithal and if you're that type of person.

267
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,900
So about a decade ago, I reached the peak with that and I had left Tucson

268
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,120
with a Victor Schauberger device, a water imploder that I built.

269
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,340
It took about six months to build and I was able to take tap water, any tap

270
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,680
water, and transform it into comparable to the best quality spring waters in

271
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,040
the world.

272
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,120
In other words, when you drank this water, it was unusually refreshing and

273
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,160
then within a few minutes, you became invigorated as if you had taken some

274
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
kind of a drug that would invigorate you.

275
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,760
Use your imagination, right?

276
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,580
It gave you incredible clarity and some people witnessed healings and things

277
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,980
like that, but just what the best water quality in the world would be using

278
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,600
tap water.

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,840
I was peddling this water in L.A., Hollywood, Beverly Hills area, Venice

280
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,760
Beach area, and all that.

281
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
It was interesting as word got around that we had the best water in the world

282
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,160
and we're able to transform any water into it.

283
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,140
So when you start getting involved with stuff like that, you have what I call

284
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,000
in air quotes, characters start appearing out of nowhere or someone knows

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,040
someone who knows someone who might be interested to talk to you kind of thing,

286
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,280
right?

287
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,800
So we had this one character.

288
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,280
He was quite interesting and his job was working for Coca-Cola, Pepsi,

289
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,920
and Nestle.

290
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,400
He was a free agent and he was a geologist.

291
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,220
What does Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Nestle have in common?

292
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,440
They all need water for their drinks and things, right?

293
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,960
So he had a company and it was a surveying, it was a geologist, and his thing

294
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:01,080
was he was hired to go out up and down the west coast to find springs,

295
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,740
water springs, natural sources.

296
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,940
So then these companies would go in and claim the spring and pump the water out

297
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,260
for free, basically, and use it in their drinks, right?

298
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,540
Right.

299
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,920
So when he would find a spring that was extremely unusual, like the quality was

300
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,740
almost, quote-unquote, magical, like this incredible water, almost like drinking

301
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,100
it and you feel like you've done cocaine or whatever.

302
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,100
By the way, if you haven't done cocaine, don't do it.

303
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm not a proponent of that, but if someone were to describe what doing Coke

304
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,260
was like was, have you ever gotten some really good news, how it made you feel?

305
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,340
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

306
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,320
That would be what it felt like.

307
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,680
So drinking this water or cocaine, for example.

308
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:40,980
Right.

309
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,100
But anyway, this was his job.

310
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,600
I will say that naturally occurring, by the way, just some of this stuff that

311
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:44,880
they're doing.

312
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,640
One other thing that Coke and Pepsi and all those companies would have in common

313
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,340
too is the need for containers.

314
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,600
Well, they make them.

315
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,140
Yeah, the containers, I found out, well, because I was a proponent of glass,

316
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,020
but what I found with plastic containers, let's say you're just a side tangent,

317
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,220
but just people wonder about where they get those millions and millions of

318
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,200
containers per day or per hour, right?

319
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,440
When you're a bottling company like that and you use those plastic containers,

320
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,440
you don't buy the containers.

321
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,380
You buy a machine that makes them and you get bags and pallets of pellets,

322
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,619
and the pellet goes into the machine.

323
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,500
The machine is about maybe it will fit in a large garage, let's say,

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,200
and out in the other end a bottle is popped out, and that's how they do it.

325
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,020
You don't buy the bottles.

326
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,500
You buy the machine that makes the bottles on the spot.

327
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,300
I've seen them.

328
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,820
They're pretty neat.

329
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,400
And that's why there's always separate local entities, your local bottler.

330
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,300
It's a totally different thing.

331
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,840
Let's get back to the what, because I think I dragged this out a little too long.

332
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,440
Well, no problem.

333
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,380
I also wanted to just state that the guys looking around for these springs,

334
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,120
they do happen.

335
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,820
Like there's one near here that is the Creek Indians allow people access to it

336
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,060
or whatever.

337
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,300
Sure.

338
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,680
I want to stay on it and keep it to cloning.

339
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,740
But I'm just saying that naturally.

341
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,280
This is why.

342
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,760
I'm not trying to push you around,

343
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,580
but what I'm trying to say is that if I get into a water tangent,

344
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,800
we'll be here two hours later talking about water.

345
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,060
Yeah, no, I don't want to do water.

346
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,660
I'm just saying that there's a difference between naturally occurring

347
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,820
and something that you do by process.

348
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,580
But this is the point.

349
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm giving a background on this guy because he wasn't just someone that was

350
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,080
hired by these companies to do that.

351
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,620
He had other things he was doing, and this is it.

352
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,680
So if he found one of these magical water springs that were extremely high

353
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,680
quality, he got into the office at the end of the day.

354
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,620
And what did he put on his report?

355
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,820
I didn't find anything today.

356
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,220
Right.

357
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,580
He kept it from these guys.

358
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:39,880
Right.

359
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
And I said, well, what for?

360
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,980
He says, because there are certain things that people are involved with,

361
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,600
certain people that require certain water quality of the highest degree.

362
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,840
And we started, I visited him a second time.

363
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,600
I said, okay, great.

364
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,220
Certain people.

365
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,080
Okay, so you're working for certain people already, but you're talking about

366
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,040
another certain people.

367
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,320
Yes.

368
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,260
Okay.

369
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,660
What was interesting about that is that we started getting into conversations,

370
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,540
and it got into what the subject is, cloning.

371
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,240
Somehow he ensued enough about it.

372
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,840
I said, do you mean like cloning, cellular regeneration?

373
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,060
He says, well, look, you know about Walter Russell.

374
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,540
I said, yeah, I've got one of his books, Universal One.

375
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,360
He says, well, you know, him and Victor Shawberger had correspondence.

376
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,720
I said, really?

377
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,740
And he said, well, what was it about?

378
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,320
He says, what it was about was to get these men to understand that the ultra

379
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,080
high-quality natural water had properties that most people are not aware of,

380
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
but are aware, again, by some people.

381
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,600
And the point was Victor Shawberger and Walter Russell were both given a task

382
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,780
to see if they can manipulate other waters to act like this water.

383
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,980
And the task was this.

384
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,720
He explained it to me.

385
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,780
I'm going to connect this.

386
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,840
They were told to take rose petals and place them in a glass of this water

387
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,280
and keep at room temperature without a cover and keep the rose petals alive

388
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,120
and looking like the day they were picked for over a year.

389
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,300
Think about that.

390
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,920
Anybody's gotten flower cuttings and things like that.

391
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,860
What does it look like even after a week if they even make it, right?

392
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah.

393
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,980
You've got to put it in water and you've got to keep switching the water out.

394
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,200
Yeah, and the florist keeps them under, you know, in a chill box and all that.

395
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,100
So the task with these guys was to put the fresh rose petals in a glass of water,

396
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,400
a container of water, open at the top, and keep them looking fresh for a year.

397
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,260
Walter Russell succeeded.

398
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,800
Okay.

399
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,880
How do you do that?

400
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,880
That sounds like magic or it sounds like really unusual stuff.

401
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,080
And the conversations were around that.

402
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,220
And, by the way, he did like the water I purveyed.

403
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,160
He says, if you didn't have the best water, like people say,

404
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,460
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

405
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,700
Getting approval from someone like that was very good.

406
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,980
But, anyway, we had roundabout discussions about things are not as they seem.

407
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,640
So here's the idea of someone putting in my head that you can keep rose petals looking like they were freshly cut

408
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,860
for over a year in an open container at room temperature.

409
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,240
There's something going on with this water quality thing.

410
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Okay.

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,620
So fast forward, this was one of the main things that I recall.

412
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Vinny Eastwood and I, back in 2011 or so, I was a frequent caller.

413
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,020
And, you know, you and I know Danny.

414
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,940
Danny knew about me.

415
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,540
He always said, oh, you should get a show here, you know, and all that.

416
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,940
I think you might know a little bit of the history before you and I even met with Danny, right?

417
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,460
Yeah, sure.

418
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,280
So he was fond of what I had to say and myself, and it was mutual.

419
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:49,060
So I was following Vinny Eastwood, and I was like, you know, I don't want to stick with Vinny too much because I'm not going in that direction.

420
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,740
I'm not into politics and making jokes about things.

421
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm into sharing information that people can use.

422
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,840
So I kind of watched around a little while, and he had this guy come on once and do an interview called Donald Marshall,

423
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,520
a young guy who sounded kind of wacky.

424
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,760
He talked about his experience at cloning centers.

425
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,340
And I was like, oh, wait a second.

426
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,120
I know about cloning.

427
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,580
Most people know about it from science fiction and all that.

428
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,640
On some level, yeah.

429
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,920
Yeah, and here's this guy not only talking about cloning but an underground world, an underground society,

430
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,700
and he's giving it with personal experiences with great specificity.

431
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,540
But this is the other part.

432
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,580
When he said how does the cloning happen, it's basically the tissue is held in a water solution with some nutrients,

433
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,740
maybe some electrical impulses, and it's slightly agitated.

434
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
And I was like, oh, my goodness.

435
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,580
Okay, he's telling the truth because this stuff is really, really simple.

436
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,420
Right?

437
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,680
Even though his story was really far out there, just as far out as any science fiction,

438
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,840
maybe even further because science fiction doesn't get as broad as describing little real reptilians.

439
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,160
Right?

440
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,920
But at that moment, I realized also the culmination of other things that I've been looking at

441
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,860
and how ignorant people are of things and how things are being used against them because of their ignorance

442
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,220
and told that there are other things.

443
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
I started piecing the cloning thing together in my own mind and watching it very slowly.

444
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,900
If you want to dive into a subject and you just want to dive, a hard dive into it for a week,

445
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,160
you're not going to get that much.

446
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,320
But if you keep it active in the back of your mind for years and years and years,

447
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,560
you'll end up collecting enough information to piece it together and see what's plausible and what's not.

448
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:25,940
Right.

449
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,680
Which we'll get into because you and I were talking about the plausibility of what happened in Manhattan in 2001

450
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,000
and I want to get into that too.

451
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,420
I really do.

452
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,080
I got it.

453
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,540
It's important.

454
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,940
So here's the thing.

455
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,180
I'm going to jump out of the cloning and get back to it.

456
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:47,660
You cannot talk about cloning without talking about nuclear or atomic devices.

457
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,360
You cannot talk about nuclear or atomic devices and cloning if you're not talking about what the agenda is

458
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:01,260
will ultimately lead that people will believe that they are the enemies themselves instead of being paranoid.

459
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,940
So these are all inextricably inseparable.

460
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,540
The reason why is because all these things are being used without the people realizing

461
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,720
and taking advantage of their ignorance as them being projected as something else.

462
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,160
So going back to the cloning, a couple of things that I've had in the back of my mind that made it plausible

463
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,760
more than ever just on my own discovery without like watching a YouTube on some talking head

464
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,580
or someone talking about what's going on.

465
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,000
There was, it might still be on YouTube, a news, just a regular local news thing.

466
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,380
And it started off by saying, oh yeah, these burn victims that lost a lot of their skin have new hope

467
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,780
and we're going to go visit today.

468
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,440
So they basically it was a laboratory that was growing skin from the person's same skin

469
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,880
like basically cloning skin in a lab that would then be brought back and grafted onto their skin and so their body.

470
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,520
And it starts off with maybe a second and a half shot of a motion video of a man standing in front of a table

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,560
that was slowly oscillating, shaking back and forth through all these glass containers on it.

472
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,760
Nothing technical, almost like the rose petals in the water with no container, no cover.

473
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,720
And it looked like just chicken skin in there.

474
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,500
And then the camera moves to the guy sitting at a table who looks like an eight and a half by 11 piece of paper, jagged,

475
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,700
puts it on something that looks like a butcher block and scrapes the top off and holds it up.

476
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,280
And it's like semi-translucent and says, this is what we're looking for.

477
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,100
This is what's going to save these people.

478
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,560
And she says that, oh, this is made from the same, the person's cells.

479
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,680
So it's not going to be rejected.

480
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,900
We take a sample and then we grow it here.

481
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,880
And she's like, you grow it?

482
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:49,440
So this was a short news thing of how this laboratory is growing skin from their own skin.

483
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,760
So if they're showing this on mainstream local news, well, they're growing skin.

484
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,580
Can someone else be growing bones and eyeballs and feet and hair?

485
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,100
Of course.

486
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,220
I heard about this growing skin thing.

487
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,320
I had a stepfather in the 80s who had suffered severe burns.

488
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,900
And this has just been a matter of fact for quite a while that they grow some skin.

489
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,640
They take some healthy skin from somewhere, if you've been burned, right, and they grow it

490
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,480
and they bring it back and then they graft it over the damaged area and repair it.

491
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,480
And then it grows together and boom, there you go.

492
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,280
Yeah, and that's still the materialist low level, but on the higher level,

493
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,020
if anyone wants to look up chromotherapy by Dinshaw-Garialdi from the turn of the century,

494
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,000
and I have personal experience with this, and it's all been very well documented,

495
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,080
severe burn victims that they couldn't do anything with

496
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,880
and basically loaded them with morphine until they died from infection for not having 90% of their skin.

497
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:00,100
He would put them under an extremely bright, intense blue light alternating with yellows and greens,

498
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,280
and within two weeks they grew all their skin back and looked like they never had a burn before.

499
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,380
Which, by the way, his laboratory, Dinshaw-Garialdi of chromotherapy,

500
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,280
or basically color and light therapy, he was out in Jersey in the 1920s,

501
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,680
and his lab was bombed with firebombs, but the reporting here, like this in the newspaper,

502
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,760
was they interviewed the locals and they said, yeah, an Army airplane,

503
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,260
which was very crude back then, flew over the house and dropped a bomb on his house.

504
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,040
And that's why the lab, because this is clearly Army on there.

505
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,500
What year was this?

506
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,260
In the late 20s, early 30s, something. You could look up.

507
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,560
So that's really rudimentary aircraft there.

508
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,460
Very basic, because they had not gotten into aircraft until that time initially.

509
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,820
It was still a biplane or whatever.

510
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,020
There's still no Air Force yet.

511
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,540
No, Air Force was after World War II.

512
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,660
Right, that's what I'm saying. I mean, it's way before that.

513
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,600
It was the Air Corps. Yeah, so they still do that today, by the way.

514
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,560
This is kind of like the thing about secrets or whatever.

515
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,060
I don't know if you remember out in San Francisco, they said a gas,

516
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,420
it was very heavily covered in the news about 10 or 12 years ago,

517
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,160
a gas pipe exploded and destroyed a neighborhood.

518
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,700
Well, I've actually talked this to someone who was at the gas company

519
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,480
that comes around sometimes, and they're laughing.

520
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,900
They said, yeah, of course they would do that.

521
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,500
What they do is if you're like a political subversive

522
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,540
or they really want to get rid of you and they just can't take it anymore,

523
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,040
well, you know, like the reporter whose Mercedes blows up on the street

524
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,580
and they said it because he hit a tree or whatever.

525
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Well, back then what they did with this woman in San Francisco,

526
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,580
they flew an F-16 and basically stung her missile into her house

527
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,500
and blew up the house.

528
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,220
You could see the crater. It's definitely a missile.

529
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,120
Before the smoke even cleared, the gas company is dispatched to go out there,

530
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,000
and what they did is they took some old gas mains that they had in their yard

531
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,340
and just started dumping the gas pipes on the street

532
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,300
to make it look like it was a gas pipe.

533
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:10,920
But clearly you see that conical, inverse cone blast crater where the house was,

534
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,840
and then about 100 feet away you see all these 30-foot or 20-foot lengths

535
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,980
of crooked rusty pipe laid out in the street.

536
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,280
There's no way that those lengths of pipe came out from that crater.

537
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,720
Just to show TV, this is how ridiculous it is.

538
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,680
Anyway, back to the cloning and how it has to be connected to nukes

539
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,100
and all this other stuff is very important.

540
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,960
But what I've surmised at this point also is that skin can be grown,

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,340
organic tissue can be grown simply by being in a certain quality of water

542
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,020
and agitated and nutrients and things like that.

543
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,220
So if we go back to Donald Marshall and see that they're grown in tanks

544
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,040
and this and that, I'm not going to get into his testimony.

545
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,300
Anyone could look him up.

546
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,640
His interview with Vinnie Eastwood is a pretty good well-covered one.

547
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,900
So I filed all this away.

548
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,260
Because to say you can clone and make another human is quite advanced.

549
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,520
We're given a documentary on how we've advanced from horse and carriage

550
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,940
to a jet airplane or whatever, but they left this out.

551
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,420
Wow. So why? Rated Y.

552
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,020
Another thing came up.

553
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,880
This was about five years ago.

554
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
An article, because I researched the Middle East.

555
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,740
Mummies were found.

556
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,980
And in the article it stated that these mummies were clones.

557
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,060
And I shared this with some people and they said,

558
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,040
oh, they're cloning mummies.

559
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,960
I said, no, no.

560
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,240
These are Egyptian mummies.

561
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,580
They said that the DNA and all that was a clone.

562
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,980
In other words, this mummy is over 2,500 years old

563
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,560
and it doesn't have direct human DNA.

564
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,920
It has the DNA of a cloned human.

565
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,380
So the Egyptians.

566
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,760
Ergo, they had cloning technology.

567
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,260
They had cloning technology.

568
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,640
And I was like, what the hell is going on?

569
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,680
I'm showing this article.

570
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,080
People say, oh, they're cloning mummies.

571
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,040
I said, no, no, no, no.

572
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,960
This mummy is a clone.

573
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,340
So it's really hard to make the connection.

574
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,060
So all these little things, I'm bringing up these points.

575
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm not going to sit here and review what you could research on your own.

576
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,440
I'm not a big proponent of sitting and watching hour-long videos about cloning

577
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,900
because, you know, it's fine.

578
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,760
In other words, you're not going to get it all and sit in one week of looking at it.

579
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,520
You have to keep the subject open.

580
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, right.

581
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,340
And I would also look at, look, slight diversion here.

582
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,780
But, I mean, the idea, the reason why somebody is saying, well, they're cloning mummies

583
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,880
is because that idea was already introduced in not just science fiction,

584
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,340
but I'll go for a silly example that just came to my head.

585
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,660
G.I. Joe, remember there was a cartoon series for a while?

586
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,520
Or, by the way, the cloning mummies of Jurassic Park, cloning dinosaurs, right?

587
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,360
So previous to cloning dinosaurs, right, G.I. Joe had this,

588
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,560
where they came up with a character that was meant to be cloned

589
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,560
from all these DNA samples of various people.

590
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,900
They came up with, I think it was called Serpentor or something.

591
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,500
Anyway, you know, because Cobra is the enemy, the snake is the enemy, right?

592
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,660
Anyway, we'll leave that alone.

593
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,180
But the point is that they introduced this in a kid's cartoon.

594
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,820
Okay?

595
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,220
In the 1980s, without a problem.

596
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,480
Where they're like, look, they're taking the Egyptian, the pharaohs,

597
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,400
and I forget who else they threw in there, but it was something like the pharaohs,

598
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,120
Napoleon, great conquerors.

599
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,060
It's everywhere.

600
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
They do start with the children.

601
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,580
You know, some of the highly advanced materials, like the metal,

602
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,060
you could crumble into a ball, and then it goes, you know,

603
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,160
you heat it with a blow dryer and it goes memory metal.

604
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:36,580
Yeah.

605
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,440
And the little levitating objects, right?

606
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,220
They always put it in a kid's toy.

607
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,240
There was kid's toys.

608
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,140
There's, as we say, kids, right?

609
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,260
People know what I mean by that.

610
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,560
In Japan, there was several people that have gotten in trouble between the 70s

611
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,240
and the early 2000s for taking a lot of these black project secret materials

612
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,300
and energy systems and putting them in children's toys.

613
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,060
And they had been, you can look this up, I forgot the name of the individual,

614
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,760
but he was put in prison and then he kind of disappeared.

615
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,040
He was working in these advanced material laboratories

616
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,760
and giving the he was actually charging it himself.

617
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,400
In other words, he was putting the money out to have the toy company make it.

618
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,500
So you basically had, between the late 70s and the early 2000s,

619
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,620
because of this guy, children's toys in Japan that represented, you know,

620
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,880
technology that's still not made public today.

621
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,460
So it is put out.

622
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,860
Then what a better way to do it.

623
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,980
Well, and they also normalized these things.

624
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,440
I point this one out.

625
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,820
I don't know what you think of it, but, I mean, what did they do?

626
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,660
They started with the drones.

627
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,580
Those were toys to start.

628
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,980
They were crappy toys, a lot of them.

629
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,900
But there were toys initially that had varying qualities that children controlled,

630
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,800
that they could fly around.

631
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
They put cameras on them, boom, drone.

632
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,600
And the drones have become more and more of a discussion and then sort of stopped.

633
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,380
But drone stuff, being out there in the kids' toys.

634
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,740
Now, I recognize there were military applications before that, but still.

635
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,880
Well, any application, you could spy on your neighbor.

636
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,500
Well, right.

637
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,380
But that's the thing, is they normalized this first with kids' toys

638
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,380
and then created the adult hobby version of it and blah, blah, blah.

639
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,280
But the point is that they were letting you know what was already in use in parts right there.

640
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,800
So I find that interesting all the time.

641
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,040
It was normalized that way.

642
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,260
So now somebody sees a little.

643
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,380
It's part of cosmic law.

644
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,320
Whether you put it out as fiction or as a toy, are you aware of it?

645
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
That's what it's about.

646
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:27,780
Right.

647
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,760
So here's the other thing.

648
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,739
I also had some, go back to the cloning.

649
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,120
Right.

650
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,460
I had some discussions with someone who, local, Raytheon is here,

651
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,199
and they make guidance systems for missiles and things like that.

652
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,380
And he's a language kind of guy.

653
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,840
So when they send, let's say, missiles over, they don't send it through UPS or DHL or whatever,

654
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,639
and you open the package when you get the missiles.

655
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
They actually send technicians to train you and set them up.

656
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,500
So he had several languages, and he would go to several countries in the world.

657
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,780
And the cloning issue came up with him once just about,

658
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,360
this was after the time when, you remember, Saddam Hussein had 14 body doubles and all that.

659
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,540
Well, I was in a discussion last night that Alexander the Great had body doubles.

660
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,300
Caesar had body doubles.

661
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,260
Everyone has body doubles throughout history.

662
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,840
This is a common thing.

663
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,620
Yeah, you can discover that constantly.

664
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,480
Any leader who is, you know, supposedly the idea is that since they're in danger of being assassinated,

665
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,700
body doubles are either recruited or created one way or another.

666
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,820
And it's, you know, sometimes they go on casting calls to look for people and whatever.

667
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,460
Right.

668
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,600
Sometimes, yeah, go ahead.

669
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,620
Or in a very superstitious society, they could be one place at one time,

670
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,120
and an hour later they're what normally would take two days to travel to appear there, right?

671
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,120
No, even if they're psychic.

672
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,960
Superstitious people would lend that to be godlike.

673
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,960
Hillary Clinton pulled that once when she was in Australia,

674
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,600
and then three hours later she's making a speech in the Netherlands.

675
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,740
And how is that possible?

676
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah, because it takes like 20 hours or whatever to get to the Netherlands physically.

677
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,560
By airplane.

678
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,160
Yeah, by airplane.

679
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,380
It could be underground railroad.

680
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,620
But here, this technical guy, we brought up cloning, and he says,

681
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
oh, yeah, of course they're clones.

682
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,120
He said, how do you perceive that?

683
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,820
What makes it plausible for you?

684
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,560
And he says, the minimalization of the security apparatus surrounding these leaders.

685
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,080
And we got into it, and I was like, of course.

686
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,420
So if you look at the security apparatus, we're not talking about, let's say, what they did to JFK,

687
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,580
but the typical security apparatus around these leaders and famous people,

688
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,100
if you notice, is at a bare minimum right now.

689
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,920
So what I mean by that is what they do is they put a clone out in public,

690
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,200
and if the clone is kidnapped, because the kidnapping world works by hire.

691
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,560
You can go on the dark web, not that I have, but I've heard this,

692
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,580
and if you want to kidnap someone, there are people for hire that do that.

693
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,900
They're usually ex-special ops military, right?

694
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,420
Yes.

695
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,500
Yeah, and the kidnapping is just the basic thing for ransom, for money.

696
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,840
So you have a minimal security apparatus, let's say a president, minister,

697
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,800
or whoever is kidnapped, and it's a clone, and they ask for the money.

698
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,180
All they do is push a button and blow up the clone.

699
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,760
What do they have left?

700
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,960
Nothing, right?

701
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,940
So the word has gotten around in the black ops, retired black ops kidnapping community

702
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,660
that don't bother kidnapping the president or prime minister or Johnny Depp or whatever,

703
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,600
because chances are if you grab them from public, it's going to be a clone.

704
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,400
You've got nothing.

705
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,600
So the kidnapping and the hostage thing has gone to a minimum with this,

706
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,740
and it's very clear to see the minimal security apparatus around these dignitaries

707
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,840
that go to memorials and things.

708
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,380
It's just like two black SUVs.

709
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,420
What the hell, right?

710
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,180
They don't care because they know it's not the real individual,

711
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,780
which leads to if it's a clone, how does it get up and make a speech?

712
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,320
Because what came up in the chat is yes, they could reproduce the body.

713
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,260
Notice I'm not getting into in-depth too much.

714
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,940
I'm just giving you my personal experiences with conversations

715
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,040
with people that made it more plausible for me.

716
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,340
Again, anyone could go and listen to the Donald Marshall,

717
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,560
which I don't wholly approve, but it's the best stuff out there and other things on their own.

718
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,280
But here's the thing.

719
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,580
What was brought up by an anon in the chat was very, very vital,

720
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,860
is that the consciousness transfer,

721
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,860
there's only one spirit of you.

722
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,320
Yes, there is possibly talk about being able to split you with split personalities,

723
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,240
but when people are asleep, if you've ever read Stalking the Wild Pendulum by Isaac Bentov,

724
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,880
one of the things that I've got out of that book was that your consciousness is always being used,

725
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,360
especially when you're asleep.

726
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
You're not using it, and the reason why you sleep is because someone else is using your consciousness.

727
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,280
And that kind of gets into the real woo-woo spooky airy-fairy zone for me,

728
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,480
because I need more than that.

729
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,980
Right, and we barely touched upon this when we were talking about external input,

730
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,520
and briefly we discussed sleep, and you kind of pivoted away from the topic real fast.

731
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,660
Yes, because I have my own personal experiences with that, not dreams,

732
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,040
and just being able to see things that maybe I shouldn't see or can see or should see,

733
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,660
however you want to say it,

734
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,660
that I have not been able to put together where I can express it in a coherent way yet.

735
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,280
But the essence of this is also our minds are always broadcasting and receiving.

736
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,560
And an example of that is you ever notice when people develop a teenage, adolescent almost body,

737
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,800
they've actually changed, they've gotten larger, more adult-like, they like to stay up all night.

738
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,880
And the reason why is because now because the brains are physically larger,

739
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,860
they're tuning into a different frequency,

740
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,740
all of the adults that are broadcasting all this garbage stop broadcasting because they're asleep.

741
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,340
So now the airwaves are clear.

742
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,120
And I find that to myself also.

743
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,700
If I'm pondering or contemplating something and I'm not making progress,

744
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,080
I deliberately set it up that I do stay awake all night when most of the society is asleep

745
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,700
because the airwaves are cleaner.

746
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,680
I mean, think of the mainstream individual, what they think of, and they're broadcasting this.

747
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,960
We're not talking about radio or speaking.

748
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,280
This is just in their minds.

749
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,500
You don't want that in the air.

750
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,440
I've always said I functionally feel better and do better late at night because of this.

751
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,020
Yeah, when all the radios are shut down, basically asleep.

752
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,660
Well, the consciousness transfer, what I've also gotten maybe about,

753
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,240
this might have been even during the time of the first ONG run,

754
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,900
I was speaking to someone in Texas because I've had a lot of interesting people

755
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,180
just come out of the woodwork on a Skype call or a telephone call, believe it or not,

756
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
or meeting in person.

757
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,720
And this one individual, first he says,

758
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,040
I'm probably one of the most dangerous people alive because of my criminal mindset.

759
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,040
I was like, what? I don't have a criminal mindset.

760
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,640
He says what he meant by that is that I have a mindset that allows me to go around obstacles,

761
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,940
things that are put in front of people, ideas.

762
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,240
I usually am able to drive around and see what's going on on the inside.

763
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
So we got into a few things and the cloning thing came up again.

764
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,620
And the consciousness transfer, basically, without getting into the little fine details

765
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,800
that may not be pertinent, what I wanted to get out of him is how is the conscious transferred?

766
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,400
He says it looks like a claw and it's magnetic.

767
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,080
You ever go to one of these carnivals or airport and they've got a thing you put a quarter in

768
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,640
and it's a claw, you move around with a joystick and you pick up a stuffed animal or a prize

769
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
and you drop it down the chute to get it?

770
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,960
I was like, yeah.

771
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,200
He says it's something like that.

772
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,540
And I was like, oh my goodness.

773
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,980
Oh man, how do you make something like that up, right?

774
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,600
And again, people don't want to give too much history or whatever,

775
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,180
but I've come across characters like that that have just come out of nowhere

776
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,320
and want to have a conversation and engage me.

777
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,420
If I ask, I know when they reach the limit and whatnot, but you know me,

778
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,160
I'm going to push it like, why, why, why?

779
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,000
Like a little child, why, why, why?

780
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,660
But in a way that makes things coherent, you know, not in an annoying way, hopefully.

781
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,540
So the cloning and the secrecy go hand in hand.

782
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,600
I want to tie this in with the nuclear aspect, the atomic aspect, because that is also secrecy.

783
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,800
How many times have you heard what the Rosenbergs, what they executed them in the 50s

784
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,440
for sharing secrets with the Soviets, right?

785
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,880
So they were trying to tell you it was very serious, even, you know, it still is.

786
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,820
The reason why this is important is just like I mentioned,

787
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,600
the cloning and the security apparatus, how minimal it is.

788
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,320
Because if you, let's say you're going to go kidnap a dignitary or a famous person,

789
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,300
you're probably going to kidnap a clone if they're just two black SUVs

790
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,860
and no security apparatus, right?

791
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,300
So it makes it worthless.

792
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:43,060
What they've done, and this is also with the agendas, ever since the 80s,

793
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,160
and by the way, I'm going to bring up Dmitry Kaluzov with a K.

794
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,740
Look up his stuff.

795
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,660
Again, I don't wholly endorse him, but, you know, the stuff that he says on this

796
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,620
is verifiable and validatable.

797
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,700
He has some weird ideas about certain things, but that's fine.

798
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,540
You pick and choose.

799
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,200
What he brought forward is that all these, like, car bombings and truck bombings

800
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,140
all the way to the World Trade Center are not possible, physically impossible,

801
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,280
as you're being told.

802
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,080
And they're actually nukes.

803
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,800
And, okay, I'm listening.

804
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,660
And when I started looking into it, it was 100% correct,

805
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,940
meaning that from a physics perspective, in other words,

806
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,140
when you go and study physics, there are certain linear,

807
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,920
quote-unquote, Newtonian values and things that are quite measurable, right?

808
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,540
Like, if you're working with electronics and you have a voltmeter

809
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,200
and you're measuring, like, voltage, amperage, and resistance,

810
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,680
that's very linear, but it works quite well.

811
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,920
The concept of blowing things up, which if you've ever talked to a mining engineer,

812
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,880
you know, the hard rock mining where they put dynamite to blast rock,

813
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,880
they don't like using terms like explosives or blowing things up for whatever reason.

814
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,560
It might be, what's that thing that listens to everything you say, right?

815
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,560
And they tag you if you use certain words, what is it called, echelon or something like that.

816
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,280
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

817
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,180
Maybe it's because of that.

818
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,420
But what they use, they call it high-speed chemistry.

819
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,240
And what's interesting is when you research explosives, I said the word again,

820
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,680
you know they're rated in feet per second, right?

821
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Like, so dynamite's in the 1,200 to 2,000 feet per second when the reaction happens.

822
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,740
Then you've got C4, and then they go up to CDX and all this other stuff.

823
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,960
It's in the 5,000 to 6,000 feet per second, right?

824
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,320
So it's the higher feet per second that this has, the more powerful it is, right?

825
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,620
Is the idea.

826
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Okay, so this is all linear stuff.

827
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:46,300
So if you show a crater, let's say they say this was a car bomb, okay, that blew up here.

828
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,340
And anyone that has some basic training in the field, usually from military or mining,

829
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,180
those are the easiest people to access.

830
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,340
If you tell him what it was, you know, soil instead of solid rock, let's say a paved road,

831
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,820
and the crater is 30 feet in diameter and 25 feet deep and it has this shape,

832
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,020
he'll pull out a calculator and he'll tell you if it's, let's say they tell you it was a basic explosive,

833
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,640
he'll tell you that in order to blow a hole like that, you need five tons of dynamite.

834
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:23,420
Okay, and then you go back, and what was it, what kind of a vehicle was it that had the car bomb?

835
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,020
It was a Nissan Sentra.

836
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,160
Okay.

837
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,180
You know what happens if you put five tons, 10,000 pounds inside of a vehicle?

838
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,420
Impossible.

839
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,860
Right?

840
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,280
Impossible.

841
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:34,660
Okay.

842
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,080
Now here's the other thing, and this goes on and on and on.

843
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,500
This is very, very typical.

844
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,400
I wanted to say the other thing and the thought escaped me.

845
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:44,660
Yes.

846
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,360
Okay.

847
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,640
With nuclear, there is a pact amongst them, no atmospheric.

848
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,520
There was something, a cartoon or a Disney thing called The Incredibles or something,

849
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,580
it was an animation, and there was this little fashion designer, they wanted uniforms.

850
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,320
She goes, no capes, no capes.

851
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,420
Anybody has a cape, right?

852
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,140
Okay.

853
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,160
Okay, so I always think about it.

854
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,920
No atmospheric.

855
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,900
That's the rule.

856
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,580
So when you bring up the concept of nuclear and atomic, everyone is just like that woman Judy Wood.

857
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,440
Oh, it couldn't have been World Trade Center atomic because you have blinded by the light.

858
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,860
Right?

859
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
Well, that's all atmospheric.

860
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,600
Well, since the 60s, the pact is no atmospherics.

861
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,800
Underground.

862
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:24,840
Underground.

863
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Everything underground.

864
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,600
Sewer pipe, buried, under a building, whatever.

865
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,600
Never atmospheric.

866
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,420
Okay.

867
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:30,720
Right?

868
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,620
Because it's very identifiable.

869
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,380
Now, here's the thing.

870
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,060
Nuclear devices do not explode.

871
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,000
They're detonated.

872
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,620
And when the detonation happens, Dimitri gets into it a little bit.

873
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,900
Basically, it's a reaction of radiation of x-rays and gamma rays,

874
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,080
and they are so intense that the reaction depends on what the environment does.

875
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,420
So if it's in the air, the air is going to catch fire and it's going to glow a bright color.

876
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,940
If it's underground, you don't see any of that.

877
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,040
All of the material, irrespectively of what it is, vaporizes,

878
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,560
and then the instant vaporization of 10,000 degrees creates a shock wave.

879
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:11,620
And then anything that is around that shock wave becomes dustified, very fine dust,

880
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,220
just from the shock wave.

881
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:13,520
Okay?

882
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,920
It doesn't have to lose its shape.

883
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,220
But if it's a building like the World Trade Center stacked up,

884
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,640
if you turned it into talcum powder, of course it's going to collapse the way it did.

885
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:21,840
Right?

886
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,300
Okay.

887
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,200
So what's interesting about this is it's always a two-step reaction.

888
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,080
There's something called the Vela satellite,

889
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,240
and it's up there to monitor explosions on the Earth

890
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,200
to see if they're chemical explosion, which is a single reaction, boom, or nuclear.

891
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,060
Nuclear is always a double flash.

892
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,780
You have the initial detonation and then the reaction, what's called an explosion.

893
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,180
It's always a double event, always.

894
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,720
So that's how they detect them, in the ground or in the sky.

895
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,840
It's always a double.

896
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,980
So when they show you something that looks like an earthquake

897
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,420
and it's just an incredibly vertical line, that is a nuke, right,

898
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,720
where a natural earthquake will have a rumble on a seismometer

899
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,920
and then build up to a large peak.

900
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,300
So these are very, very measurable.

901
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,560
And based on what size nuke they are,

902
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,240
they are always judged by going back to classic explosives and tonnage.

903
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,760
Why is this important?

904
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,080
Okay, let's just fast forward.

905
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,840
Now, I'm not going to get into the World Trade Center stuff,

906
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,600
the nuclear demolition.

907
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,080
Go listen to Dimitri Kalozoi.

908
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,000
I have a four-hour video, you can still find it,

909
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,640
on how the World Trade Center was done.

910
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,800
He gets very technical, but in common parlance, you understand what he's saying.

911
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,800
The Murrell Building and all these other things.

912
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,640
So it's very easy to determine what's nuclear and what's not,

913
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,140
simply by saying, if that was a Nissan Sentra with a car bomb

914
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,860
and it required five tons of TNT to do it,

915
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,520
and they tell you it was TNT, you know that's a bullshit story.

916
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,000
So here's how you identify,

917
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,580
because this might be in a neighborhood near you.

918
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,620
For example, if you lived in the Middle East,

919
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,920
they do a lot of these car bombs that shatter windows for a mile

920
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,880
and create these big craters.

921
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,160
Well, I don't know who's listening here who might be there.

922
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,690
You might want to not be there immediately.

923
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,240
And this is how, right?

924
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,980
If it's a nuke, because even the new nukes,

925
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,600
the eighth generation that they're up to,

926
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,220
do not put out the radiation as old atomics do.

927
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,220
And I want to go back to how do you prevent yourself

928
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,980
from being exposed to this anyway.

929
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,000
Before that, I want to get into one thing.

930
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,460
You know how the flat earthers are running around

931
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,140
saying there's no globe, right?

932
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,980
You're an idiot if you believe that it's round.

933
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,180
There is also a movement that says there is no nukes, right?

934
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,800
So with the flat earth thing, I say yes,

935
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,200
the earth is not flat and it's not a ball.

936
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,540
It depends on what you're doing.

937
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,680
If you're an architect and you're making level and plumb lines,

938
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,080
or agriculture, making a ditch five miles long,

939
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,780
you build all that as if the earth is flat.

940
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,980
You don't account for curvature, never, right?

941
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,860
But if you're a surveyor and you're making a map over hundreds of miles,

942
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,660
you'll notice that your buddy on the other end that's aiming at you,

943
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,720
you cannot form a triangle.

944
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,040
It's always going to show a curve.

945
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,740
That's why in certain large roads and cities,

946
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,780
the avenues go for a few miles and there's a jog in the road, right?

947
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,340
So if you're doing maps and other things like that, it's a ball.

948
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,780
But if you're doing agriculture, it's flat.

949
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,200
And architecture, it's flat.

950
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,720
If you're doing farming, it's flat.

951
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,680
The sun comes up on the east and goes down on the west.

952
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,820
The earth is not moving.

953
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,980
If you're firing projectiles, you also have to account for curvature too.

954
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,080
I've been told that by snipers.

955
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,740
Yep, the 45-degree rule and all that.

956
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,980
So it's both.

957
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:51,280
In other words, this reality that we're living in is malleable because of that.

958
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,160
So there are no nukes.

959
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,300
The underlying thing, when someone brings it up,

960
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,800
there's a lot of people, flat earther types,

961
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,080
there's no such thing as a nuke.

962
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,160
They're just using big…

963
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,840
Okay, just like the flat earthers are right some of the time,

964
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,080
these guys are right some of the time also.

965
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,080
No, there are not nukes.

966
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,140
Because what they're telling you, they're splitting the atom.

967
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,700
There is no such thing going on.

968
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,860
And by the way, I had spoken to someone who was Army, Air Force,

969
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,120
that guarded a lot of the nukes that they had in the 80s.

970
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,680
And he guarded them.

971
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,780
And then he got more training and started maintaining them.

972
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,780
And I had a discussion with him that really got him upset.

973
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,220
And this is a discussion that went like this.

974
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,900
And this will cover that.

975
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,740
There are no nukes.

976
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,380
People are saying there are no nukes.

977
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
They're just using explosives.

978
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,060
And they're correct from that perspective.

979
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,200
They're not splitting the atom.

980
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,620
But I'll tell you what they're doing.

981
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,680
It's even more crazy.

982
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,160
It's just as crazy as the cloning.

983
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,620
What you've heard of, there's a nuclear core.

984
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,740
They got the radioactive material,

985
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,360
and they basically implode that with a small explosion,

986
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,060
and it sets off a trigger reaction.

987
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,780
Well, there's more of that.

988
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,780
What they're actually doing is what Tesla talked about

989
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,980
as finding a virtual ground.

990
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,880
In other words, when you have a positive or a negative,

991
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,000
you know the car battery won't work unless you hook up both or your flashlight.

992
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,240
Well, in this case, you have a situation where all you need is the positive lead,

993
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,220
and the negative takes care of itself.

994
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,640
The negative is the environment.

995
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:21,240
What I mean by that, very simply, is that this material,

996
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,380
these very heavy metals, when they're constructed,

997
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,920
this is what upset the fellow that maintained these.

998
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,620
And so there's no chemical reaction, not splitting any atoms or anything like that.

999
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,760
You're grounding the ether.

1000
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,540
Basically, all the energy that we have, the universal energy, the ether,

1001
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,940
is being grounded on this one spot because of the type of metal it is.

1002
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,700
And proof of that is that you guys,

1003
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,720
the efficacy of this device able to detonate is based on the beryllium reflectors.

1004
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,120
If the beryllium reflectors are off and not as perfect as possible,

1005
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,560
it will not detonate.

1006
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,020
And he just got livid with me.

1007
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,880
He says, you're not supposed to talk about that.

1008
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,580
And the reason why is if you look at what they call a nuclear device,

1009
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,520
no matter how small or how large it is, you have a certain amount of material.

1010
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,280
A thermonuclear and atomic are different.

1011
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,640
Different materials for thermonuclear, but atomic is very basic.

1012
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,140
That material, let's say it's plutonium or uranium or whatever,

1013
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,760
is surrounded, encased in a concentric sphere that is highly reflective beryllium,

1014
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,100
which is a type of metal.

1015
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,720
It's very light and very strong.

1016
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,240
And it's basically a metal ball inside of another sphere that is highly reflective,

1017
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,460
literally a mirror, and it has to be perfect.

1018
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,660
So what they're doing is setting off a reaction that vaporizes anything around it.

1019
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,180
And so it is not nuclear, like remember the flat earthers versus the globe,

1020
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,720
you have there's no such thing as nukes versus there is nukes.

1021
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,000
They're both right and they're both wrong.

1022
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,760
What's happening, very simply,

1023
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:59,320
is I don't know if anyone here has ever poorly connected or misconnected a car battery

1024
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:06,680
and the wrench touches one of the terminals and you see a very bright flash and a poof.

1025
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,940
Hopefully you haven't done that with a bus bar on a breaker on a house or something.

1026
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,240
When you go back and look at that wrench that touched the terminal, it's gone.

1027
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,300
Whatever touched it, depending on how powerful the battery is or the yield,

1028
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,100
whatever part of the wrench or whatever tool touched it, it's missing.

1029
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,400
It's no longer there.

1030
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,380
What happened to it?

1031
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,500
It's not like it broke off.

1032
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,300
Let's go find it and stick it back on.

1033
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:30,980
It's gone.

1034
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
It vaporized.

1035
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,940
That's exactly what's happening with these devices.

1036
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,660
So the no nukes people are correct,

1037
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,540
but they're not correct when they say, oh, it's just certain chemical explosives.

1038
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,220
No, this is the ability.

1039
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,600
They have the ability.

1040
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,360
They who build these things.

1041
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,220
By the way, hearkening back to Dmitry Kalazov,

1042
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,380
the idea when they tell you these terrorists got some nukes,

1043
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,800
that's almost an impossibility.

1044
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,840
It's kind of like the super notes.

1045
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,140
It's like counterfeiting money.

1046
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,220
If there is, let's say, counterfeit notes,

1047
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,280
it's usually done by another country because you cannot get that press to do it.

1048
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,340
So what they call a super note.

1049
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,880
So, in other words, to counterfeit money,

1050
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:19,120
you must have access to this Swiss press that presses the notes in order to do it.

1051
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:24,180
And the only way they could find this counterfeit is if the serial numbers are not recorded in their own files.

1052
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,100
They call them super notes.

1053
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,880
There was a whole bunch of them about a decade ago.

1054
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,220
If you remember, hundreds all over.

1055
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,020
And that was done by North Korea because they're a government.

1056
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,200
They can afford one of these presses for their own money.

1057
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,580
With nukes, it's the same thing.

1058
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,100
There is a huge apparatus.

1059
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,380
If you look and study the original Manhattan Project,

1060
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,460
which, by the way, was a plutonium, not uranium.

1061
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,680
So the uranium bomb must have been gotten from the Germans who were only doing uranium.

1062
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,600
But anyway, it even looked different.

1063
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,400
If you look at what they show you publicly about these facilities that develop nukes,

1064
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,540
they're very large, elaborate facilities.

1065
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,060
And it's not because they're a government project.

1066
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,560
It's because the processes require that.

1067
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,720
So if there is ever one of these devices, and there are companies that make them.

1068
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,320
I can name some of them, but I won't because they're not that public.

1069
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,640
But they're in South Africa, for example, and places like that.

1070
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,380
Netherlands that make these.

1071
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,920
And San Diego is another one that makes these, the reflectors and the cores.

1072
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,560
One way to find this out is when you look at Google Maps

1073
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,420
and you see a parking lot with 500 cars and just a little building.

1074
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,320
There's no way all those people, almost one person is driving three cars to get to work.

1075
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,320
Okay, you get it.

1076
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,040
The majority of the facility would have to be underground.

1077
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,560
Yeah, exactly.

1078
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,060
And there are major companies that do this part of their gig.

1079
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,440
In other words, it's like the Super Notes.

1080
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,900
No one is going to counterfeit it with a color laser printer.

1081
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,440
You need that Swiss press.

1082
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,440
I forgot the name of it.

1083
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,840
Maybe you might have heard of it, right?

1084
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,620
There's a company in Switzerland that makes those presses.

1085
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,000
You must have access to that.

1086
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,000
So the mob is not doing counterfeit notes.

1087
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,820
It's another country that's doing it.

1088
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,040
No terrorists are building nukes.

1089
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,140
It's some government-sanctioned corporation facility that's putting them out there.

1090
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,240
How does this coincide with cloning?

1091
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:28,300
Well, the security apparatus, they put these clones out, people with consciousness transfer.

1092
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,440
Minimal security apparatus for whatever reason, even ritualistic purposes.

1093
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,540
But you are told that it's not a clone, obviously.

1094
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,480
They're putting out, quote-unquote, terrorist events since the 1980s.

1095
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,100
You had the barracks in Lebanon.

1096
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,540
Some of the military people sued the government because of that.

1097
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,600
They said it was a milk truck that drove under,

1098
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,480
and it was the largest conventional explosion known to man.

1099
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:54,940
Bullshit.

1100
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,780
All these things.

1101
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:03,840
And World Trade Center, diesel fuel or jet fuel brought the towers down.

1102
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,420
This is important because it's still being used against people.

1103
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:10,860
Why?

1104
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,060
And I want to go back to how to identify it,

1105
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,880
especially if you're living in places like the Middle East,

1106
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,860
but it is also here in the U.S.

1107
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:26,700
If you hear of an explosion, quote-unquote, chemical factory, car bomb, whatever,

1108
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,780
and you approach the area, you know, if it smells like a duck, looks like a duck,

1109
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,420
sounds like a duck, it's probably a duck.

1110
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,480
Well, you're going to be told that it looks like a regular whatever,

1111
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,540
and it sounded like a regular whatever.

1112
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,000
So the only thing that you have left to determine if it was a nuke that went off,

1113
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,560
if it was a local explosion, is your smell, what it smells like.

1114
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,240
And by the way, even with standard explosives,

1115
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:56,320
they have spectrometers that actually smell the air to tell you what type of explosive it was.

1116
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,200
Those do exist.

1117
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,000
Just like the gunpowder testing, right?

1118
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,860
So here's the thing.

1119
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,740
When someone shoots a gun and they get caught even two days later,

1120
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,160
they could still find residue, right?

1121
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
It's that kind of residue.

1122
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,260
It's a metallic thing that sticks to the skin.

1123
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,240
But anyway.

1124
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,860
Not with the publicly known GSR test, though.

1125
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,280
That only lasts a few hours, really.

1126
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:26,960
Yeah, it has to be a very good spectrometer that will get really fine.

1127
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,520
Okay, so how can you tell?

1128
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,340
It's the smell.

1129
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,560
What does it smell like?

1130
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,640
Okay, when these devices go off, it's called ionization.

1131
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,280
So it's an extremely pungent smell.

1132
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,660
Now, if you're familiar with what an ozone generator smells like,

1133
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,380
I've brought this up to people.

1134
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,560
Usually people say, yes, I've smelled ozone before.

1135
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,420
But there's plenty of people who haven't.

1136
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,880
So how do you identify the smell of it?

1137
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,860
It smells like chlorine bleach, laundry bleach.

1138
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,360
Kind of, yeah.

1139
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,620
A little bit, with gasoline.

1140
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,580
You know that sharp gasoline smell?

1141
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:07,880
It's very pungent, almost an electric burn also does in ionize,

1142
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,020
depending on the material.

1143
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,720
You'll get that, right?

1144
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,880
But it's pungent, and it's very distinctive,

1145
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,740
almost like, you know, the old school matches.

1146
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,220
When you strike them, it's got that matched sulfur smell.

1147
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:17,940
Very distinctive.

1148
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,600
Very rare that anything smells like that.

1149
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,240
Right, right.

1150
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,980
The same with ionization.

1151
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,060
The closest you're going to get is maybe like a gasoline, sharp gasoline,

1152
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,740
when you're, like, walking by a gas station.

1153
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,640
Not when you're over, you know, that little wefting of gasoline

1154
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,520
with chlorine bleach kind of ionization.

1155
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,620
That's what it smells like, right?

1156
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,900
It's very, very pungent.

1157
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,900
By the way, World Trade Center, I think, Chuck,

1158
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,680
you were there after the disaster, because it was really a disaster.

1159
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,500
People were complaining in Jersey, calling the EPA,

1160
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,120
saying it smells like an electrical fire.

1161
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,620
This was two months later as the vapors were still coming down the ground,

1162
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,380
and the EPA responded saying, well, there was a lot of wires in the buildings.

1163
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,740
Yeah, pretty much that's a fairly good representation of what was going on.

1164
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,160
But over in Bayonne and Jersey City and stuff like that,

1165
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,200
just across from, really across the river from Manhattan Island,

1166
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,480
yeah, there was plenty of complaints about that.

1167
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:11,200
Yeah.

1168
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,000
Yeah, and the complaint was it smelled bad because it smelled like an electrical fire,

1169
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,940
like when electric wires burn and things like that, right?

1170
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,500
Right, minus the rubber.

1171
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,520
Which is ionization.

1172
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,700
Right, minus the rubber.

1173
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,560
You see, that's the thing.

1174
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,560
People, when they think about electrical fire smells,

1175
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,200
a lot of times they remember the rubber, too.

1176
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:26,860
Forget the rubber.

1177
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,820
The insulation, yeah.

1178
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,720
Yeah, forget that.

1179
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,920
It's the rest of it.

1180
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,120
Yeah, very strong ionization.

1181
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,600
There's a book about the Marines that were sent over to Hiroshima

1182
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,440
and clean it up in letters that they wrote.

1183
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,380
I think it was Seven Hours to Zero or whatever.

1184
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,400
You could research it.

1185
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,600
A book written by Marines that cleaned up Hiroshima.

1186
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,040
And what they all got sick from was the intense smell of ionization.

1187
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,900
And some of them do say there was an intense smell of ionization.

1188
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,160
It smelled like gasoline mixed with blood mixed with this, right?

1189
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,760
And they're trying to explain how bad the smell was.

1190
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,360
It made them ill, okay, because it was atmospheric,

1191
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,580
so there's very little radiation unless you put the dust inside of your body.

1192
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,800
Also, what they're doing with the clones and the nuclear devices,

1193
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,300
telling you that they're car bombs or terrorist bombs,

1194
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,860
is all of these events, subsequent events that might come forward,

1195
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,980
and they're going to be using the pact that I mentioned earlier.

1196
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,080
No atmospheric.

1197
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,260
Must be underground.

1198
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:31,820
So if you heard of the faked alien invasion, okay, this is how it goes.

1199
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,340
They have nukes underground.

1200
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,500
When they go off, there's a surface reaction,

1201
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,660
and everything on the surface turns to dust.

1202
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,320
It leaves a small crater, but people standing there will turn to dust.

1203
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,980
Buildings, anything, irrespective of what it is, will turn to dust.

1204
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,900
Which, by the way, that was the other thing that was a major complaint

1205
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:56,060
that came across the river is this dust that just kind of rained down on everything

1206
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,080
and stuck to everything.

1207
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,240
It was very consistent, 50 micron or smaller,

1208
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,640
and that dust was not asbestos or concrete.

1209
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,540
It was steel.

1210
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:04,880
It was a powder.

1211
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:09,340
I don't know what it was consisted of, but I do know by looking at it myself,

1212
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,060
it was powder.

1213
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,720
Even today, back in like around 2012,

1214
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,460
I got in touch with someone who had some of the powder from the World Trade Center,

1215
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,780
and I said, put a magnet to it.

1216
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,120
It's not a concrete dust.

1217
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:20,820
It's all steel.

1218
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:26,740
The tower is 90% steel that turned into that fine dust, irrespective of material.

1219
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,560
If you're a human being alive, you will turn into charcoal first.

1220
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,400
You go online and research.

1221
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,520
It's called a WTC human refuse.

1222
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,440
The bodies that they found were called human refuse, okay,

1223
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,580
and you'll see someone laying down with a T-shirt and jeans,

1224
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,760
and they're completely burned up black like charcoal briquette,

1225
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,280
but their clothes are not scorched at all, okay?

1226
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,280
That's another end of research.

1227
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,400
Anyway, the interesting thing, the fake alien invasion would go thusly.

1228
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,400
You have the reaction of these devices.

1229
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,480
They could be very small, the size of a cell phone, which they were used.

1230
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,400
There is a lot of reporting from ex-military.

1231
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,080
They did have them back in the 90s the size of a cell phone,

1232
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,080
which is they would get some rogue generals in Bosnia,

1233
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,700
even though they had a ceasefire peace treaty.

1234
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,900
These guys kept fighting, so they had to get rid of them.

1235
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,240
He needs a new cell phone, so they deliver a new cell phone.

1236
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,660
He turns it on, and it makes a 50-foot crater in the ground, right?

1237
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,140
So this was used in the 90s.

1238
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,720
That's how small they are, 8th, 10th generation, whatever.

1239
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,340
Back to the alien invasion.

1240
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,420
You see the vaporization. You smell the ionization. It's a nuke.

1241
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,260
But, of course, somebody got it on film.

1242
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,840
But when they put it on film,

1243
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:50,180
you're going to see a flying saucer or something like that in the sky

1244
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,780
shoot down a beam, and that flying saucer is not there.

1245
01:04:54,860 --> 01:05:00,440
And right before, the nuke goes off, and the surface reaction happens.

1246
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,460
So the people on TV are being told it's a nuclear invasion,

1247
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,140
and they're going to see the flying saucer above,

1248
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,680
and then the ground vaporized below.

1249
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,860
But the people that were there never saw such a thing.

1250
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:14,260
You see?

1251
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,800
See where I'm going with this?

1252
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,520
Same thing at the World Trade Center.

1253
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,420
Now, I know you and I could get into it.

1254
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,800
I say there's no planes that went into the World Trade Center

1255
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,120
strictly because it's physically impossible.

1256
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,200
What I know from aviation, two things for sure.

1257
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,540
When a plane crashes, even before the crash is complete,

1258
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,340
on a large plane, even a small plane,

1259
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,020
the tail rudder section breaks off from the shock,

1260
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,200
no matter how fast it's going.

1261
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,160
Even missiles, if you ever watch missile testing,

1262
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,760
when the missile physically hits the target,

1263
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:53,620
the rear tail section breaks off in a thousandth of a second.

1264
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,020
It's just one of these phenomena that happen with flying objects.

1265
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,820
The other thing was no one was looking up at all,

1266
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,540
because a careening plane going into a building,

1267
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,920
you're going to look up, anyone that lives near an airport.

1268
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,680
I remember once going to an airport,

1269
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,160
and as the plane comes really low,

1270
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,700
like over the chain link fence to land at a big airport,

1271
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,420
the cab driver has to look at it.

1272
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,960
Even though this is his ride, he's exposed to this all day long.

1273
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,980
You shouldn't bother him, but he still looks at it.

1274
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,040
It's one of these things.

1275
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,640
It's kind of spooky when you have an extremely loud, large plane

1276
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,600
flying at low altitude, lower than normal.

1277
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,140
You're going to look at it, always.

1278
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,540
If you look at the 9-11 videos,

1279
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,060
no one is looking up the street videos

1280
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,320
until the side of the building explodes.

1281
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,680
No one is looking up at all,

1282
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:48,760
which is basically, from a human behavior standpoint, impossible.

1283
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,880
Well, see, there you go.

1284
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,740
The reason why you mentioned that we could get into it

1285
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:56,840
is because you and I talked, without recording, about this.

1286
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,640
What I tried to tell you is that I know people saw planes.

1287
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,960
Now, why do I know that?

1288
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,700
No, no, you know that people said they saw planes.

1289
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,260
Right, but at the time, before the reporting,

1290
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,140
before the second plane even hit, they had noted to me.

1291
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,660
Now, I will tell you that they didn't note a strike on the building,

1292
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,800
but they did note a plane flying in a place where it shouldn't have been,

1293
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,420
where it wasn't normally, because in Manhattan,

1294
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,640
most of the planes that go overhead are not noticed anymore

1295
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,840
because you get accustomed to it.

1296
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,340
But this was unusual, because this caused them to look up,

1297
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,400
and then they heard that it struck the tower.

1298
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,580
Okay, they heard it struck the tower, they didn't see that,

1299
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,880
but they did see planes flying in unusual places

1300
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,100
where they would not have normally been.

1301
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,700
And that, I can report to you, happened before the media broadcast it.

1302
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,120
No, it wasn't that.

1303
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,520
This started happening because there was an immediate interruption

1304
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,660
in certain communications,

1305
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,820
and then we started communicating with each other

1306
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,200
regarding why is it we're not having credit card payments go through,

1307
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,840
why is it that banking has suddenly stopped, things like this,

1308
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,880
and that was the explanation,

1309
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,400
because this had occurred in the World Trade Center complex.

1310
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,460
Now, I'm not saying that I know anybody personally

1311
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,060
that says they saw a plane hit a tower.

1312
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:22,920
However, planes flying in ways that, well,

1313
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,540
eventually could be explained that way.

1314
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,080
Yes.

1315
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,439
Communications planes.

1316
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,319
Usually, by the way, I'm glad you brought that up,

1317
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,500
planes flying unusually.

1318
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,640
If you are wherever you might be in the world,

1319
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,260
and you see an unusual amount of what might look like unmarked planes,

1320
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,460
helicopters, more planes than helicopters,

1321
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,859
because they carry more equipment,

1322
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,740
in the area circling or flying around,

1323
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,340
and you're not near a military base, something's up.

1324
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,560
And what these planes do is they control communications.

1325
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,040
In other words, if they want to pull some shenanigans somewhere,

1326
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,420
they may not want people there to immediately communicate

1327
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,660
to others outside of that area.

1328
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,880
And these planes do jamming and all kinds of other things

1329
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,359
or can put in fake calls.

1330
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,779
They're communications planes, basically.

1331
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,220
Which, by the way, when the tower, the first tower fell,

1332
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,380
which I don't think anybody would dispute that the tower fell.

1333
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,859
Yeah, it dustified, yeah.

1334
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:21,840
Well, it fell.

1335
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,460
Whatever condition it was in, it fell, right?

1336
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,140
But when that happened,

1337
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:30,660
there was a significant interruption in communications,

1338
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,100
which that was cell phones and all that stuff throughout the area

1339
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,040
which spread well beyond the island of Manhattan.

1340
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,200
So there was a large blanket effect here that took place.

1341
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:43,880
Sure.

1342
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,479
Yeah, but that I know, not because of reporting,

1343
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,080
not because of research, but because I was in the area.

1344
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,820
Yeah, I was camping in the woods.

1345
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,000
I didn't find out until later, and when I saw that,

1346
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,820
I was like, World Trade Center, holy crap,

1347
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,860
because I was made aware.

1348
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,740
Here's the thing I want to bring up.

1349
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,020
I mentioned this before.

1350
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,440
Yeah, just saying, I was at work,

1351
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,760
and this is why I was in communication with people right away

1352
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:12,720
because I was working in the retail end of fuel and stuff like that,

1353
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,160
and you have constant communications with banks and things like this.

1354
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,340
So that was part of my job, and this is how this happened.

1355
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,440
Plus, I had a cell phone,

1356
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,920
and I knew plenty of other people that had cell phones,

1357
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,160
and cell phones were interrupted.

1358
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,560
Communications between banks were interrupted.

1359
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,340
Some places had satellite dishes that we were supposed to be interconnected,

1360
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,980
you know, outside of those sorts of cell towers and things,

1361
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,120
and guess what?

1362
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,100
All of it basically went poof.

1363
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,220
A bunch of it got interrupted.

1364
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,900
Well, they said the tower, the main transmitter up there,

1365
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,760
but their cell phones is not a, you know what I mean?

1366
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:43,920
Right.

1367
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,900
It was a bunch of crap, the explanation I gave,

1368
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,960
but I'm just telling you the real-world event, though,

1369
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,520
that was occurring had an effect that was, you know,

1370
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,040
throughout the entirety of the area, not just in New York.

1371
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,960
It was all the way into New Jersey and stuff like that,

1372
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,040
and I've explained before I tried to get onto the island.

1373
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,340
I wanted to help dig people out,

1374
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,920
but the island was already sealed off by the time I got there.

1375
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,080
The island of Manhattan is what I'm referring to, by the way.

1376
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,880
But, yeah, but go ahead.

1377
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,160
I just wanted to interject that and let you run with it any way you want.

1378
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,100
Yeah, this is where we get into the personal experiences

1379
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,920
to validate or verify what we're saying is not just something we watch the YouTube video on.

1380
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,980
I'm not into letting people talk and then saying,

1381
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,320
when do you stop talking, give me the microphone so I can talk.

1382
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,300
I think that when the personal experience is very cogent

1383
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,560
and attached to what we're saying to build it and to help others, of course,

1384
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,120
if people want to talk about their personal experience,

1385
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,680
how is it going to help me, right?

1386
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,840
That's the main point.

1387
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,760
That's a very old farming adage.

1388
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,380
You go to a farmer and have a conversation.

1389
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,680
He's like, boy, I got things to do.

1390
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,320
You got something to tell me that can make my crops grow better?

1391
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,720
You see, that's the philosophy that I have with it.

1392
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:00,880
What I go with that is I'll give a little bit of how I piece things together

1393
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,140
because this is probably how everyone can piece things together in their own way.

1394
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,340
Do you remember in the 70s they had Carl Sagan do a show called Cosmos

1395
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,880
talking about billions and billions of stars and all that?

1396
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,660
If you guys are old enough, you'll remember that.

1397
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,080
I remember.

1398
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,540
At the time, it was fascinating.

1399
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:18,620
It was in the 70s.

1400
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,600
I was in my early teens or whatever.

1401
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,360
Well, there was another show with a guy named James Burke called Connections

1402
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,160
from the BBC.

1403
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,680
It was a miniseries of 10.

1404
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,480
I just looked it up this morning when I was thinking about what we're going to be speaking of.

1405
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,360
They have all the series on YouTube.

1406
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,780
It's called Connections, James Burke, I think.

1407
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,240
It's how one thing connects to another,

1408
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:42,880
how rope making in the 1500s led us to the automobile, right?

1409
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,280
Sure.

1410
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,140
Things like that.

1411
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,960
It's still using the bullshit history that we're given,

1412
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:52,860
but it just expands you from an extra category, cross-pollination of different things

1413
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,100
that seem non-interrelated, right?

1414
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:55,520
Okay.

1415
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,620
So my experience with that was when the Statue of Liberty in Ellis Island

1416
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,680
was being renovated in the mid-80s,

1417
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,200
I took on occupation, almost like an apprenticeship,

1418
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:11,440
of doing drafting in an engineering office, right?

1419
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,580
I did this for a few months.

1420
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,100
I was thinking maybe I want to go into that, right?

1421
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,780
Because I always had a mathematical engineering mindset.

1422
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,440
And what was specific about that was certain scaffolding couldn't be attached,

1423
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,900
let's say, to the Statue of Liberty.

1424
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,300
It had to be free-floating.

1425
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,960
And how do you put up a 300-foot scaffold not attached to anything?

1426
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,800
Well, when the wind load came, it would twist and rotate

1427
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,540
instead of lean against the statue.

1428
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,080
Anytime a bolt was removed or attached to the scaffolding,

1429
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,320
it had to be documented and changed on the drawings.

1430
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,300
And that's what I was doing.

1431
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,420
It was maybe a dozen other people.

1432
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:51,680
And the engineering firm at the time, we would be there at odd hours

1433
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,340
because we didn't like being there in the main hours because it was crowded.

1434
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,060
It was like one of these things where it's important,

1435
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,640
so you have 24 hours access to the office, right?

1436
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,680
You go in and do your thing.

1437
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,760
There was an old man in a wheelchair.

1438
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,360
He was the son of one of the founders.

1439
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,240
And he says, well, what are you doing here?

1440
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,480
A young guy like you should be out enjoying yourself or whatever.

1441
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,880
I said, yeah, I do enjoy myself.

1442
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,500
I ride mountain bike, which was a new thing back then.

1443
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,500
I do trials, things like that.

1444
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,100
And I go down by the World Trade Center,

1445
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,860
and I ride my bike in that open courtyard area.

1446
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,720
He says, oh, no, World Trade Center?

1447
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,460
This is mid-'80s.

1448
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,660
He says, you stay away from there.

1449
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,720
They have nukes in there.

1450
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,000
And I'm like, oh, this crazy old senile guy, right?

1451
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:34,820
But if you watch the first episode of Connections,

1452
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,120
this is where I thought the nukes were, being naive.

1453
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,080
And when you get very little information,

1454
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,500
you've got to piece it together with what you know,

1455
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,600
which is usually false.

1456
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,780
The opening of Connections with James Burke, the first episode,

1457
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,600
it's him speaking, and he's in the courtyard of the World Trade Center.

1458
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,560
And in the middle, there's a sculpture of a bronze ball about 20 feet in diameter.

1459
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,780
And back in the 80s, you know, the Reagan with the nuclear scare with Russia

1460
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,920
and all this other stuff, right?

1461
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,640
That was like a second hype.

1462
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,340
Yeah, the second hype, he was all threats back and forth.

1463
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,060
Well, we were thinking, what are these nukes you're talking about?

1464
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,480
Well, there's a core, there's a ball.

1465
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,460
So when I went to the World Trade Center after this crazy old man told me that,

1466
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,060
I said, oh, the nuke is probably in that bronze ball

1467
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,680
because it resembles the bowling ball thing that they show on documentaries, right?

1468
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,600
So I was like, oh, okay, maybe that verifies or validates it in my mind.

1469
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:32,540
But in my mind, since the mid-'80s, I associated WTC equals nukes.

1470
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:36,100
I just didn't know how, you see, until much later.

1471
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,220
So this is my personal experience way before the fact.

1472
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,700
But could I come out and tell you that, oh, there's nukes at the World Trade Center

1473
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,840
that are going to be used to demolish it?

1474
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,940
They're 200 feet underground?

1475
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,900
No, I couldn't do that.

1476
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,680
But we got a slight premonition.

1477
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,880
This is what attaches it back to cloning, right?

1478
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,360
There's plenty of stuff on there.

1479
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,840
They're called MK Ultra fails where people are just acting too strange.

1480
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:57,400
Are they clones?

1481
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,020
Maybe, maybe not, right?

1482
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:05,320
But without us, I don't think we were planning on getting into, let's say,

1483
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,540
a quote-unquote debate about planes or no planes, and I don't think we need to.

1484
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,300
I think that's up to whoever views it.

1485
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,900
Absolutely, absolutely.

1486
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,740
You know, about the Statue of Liberty thing, though, just really quick,

1487
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:22,500
they started doing those renovations or preparing for them at least by 1981.

1488
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,320
This was in the late-'80s.

1489
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,400
They opened it in 86.

1490
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,460
Yeah, but in 81, I know for a fact because I went there on a school trip,

1491
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:37,680
and we weren't allowed to go into the arm of the lady.

1492
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,760
You used to be able to go into the arm and actually go on the torch, right?

1493
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,460
Well, hold on a second.

1494
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,860
They say that no one's been into the arm since 1916

1495
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:49,300
when they blew up Tom Island off of Jersey City.

1496
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,240
No one talks about Black Tom.

1497
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,140
Two million pounds of TNT?

1498
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:54,700
Yeah.

1499
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,200
Anyway.

1500
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,800
No, that's true, but I'm just telling you what I was told when I was 9 years old.

1501
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,460
I know, but this is kind of Mandela effect territory now

1502
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,200
because I remember in the 70s being able to walk up to the arm.

1503
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,740
It was a very tight, winding staircase.

1504
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,440
Well, but the thing is it lines up more with you

1505
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,960
because I was told that it's only recently you can't go into the torch.

1506
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,100
Now, I was able to go all the way up into the crown.

1507
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,380
I personally walked up.

1508
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,260
They had us walk up the Statue of Liberty.

1509
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:24,880
I have no idea why, but it was one of these things that we did in third grade.

1510
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:24,980
Yeah.

1511
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,600
As you get up, it gets narrow.

1512
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,960
It's painted white, and there's a little marker graffiti on a lot of places,

1513
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,060
and it's a narrow, winding staircase.

1514
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:32,620
Exactly.

1515
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,680
Yeah, right, but that was the thing.

1516
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,800
We asked, can we go in the torch?

1517
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,480
We were told no because recently they've closed it off

1518
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,980
because there's going to be renovations.

1519
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,800
By the way, you can see evidence of those renovations

1520
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,220
if you watch old episodes of Saturday Night Live

1521
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,240
because they always show stuff from New York, right?

1522
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,040
They always show the Statue of Liberty,

1523
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,920
and during a certain period they showed scaffolding around the Statue of Liberty.

1524
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,280
So now I'm just pointing out that there's ways of looking at this

1525
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,260
and verifying parts of what you're saying, that's all.

1526
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:05,060
Sure, but the bottom line with this is the secrecy element,

1527
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,800
and I think the thing that's going to probably be contacting

1528
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,940
or people will have contact with more, hopefully not,

1529
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,600
is the possibility of where nearby you're being told

1530
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,980
that there was a quote-unquote explosion, right?

1531
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,360
And I'm telling you that if based on what they're telling you caused the explosion

1532
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,900
and what the explosion usually, what really is, is not as they say.

1533
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:33,800
And the way you would identify it as what we just talked about

1534
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,780
is by that strong ionization smell, right?

1535
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
That might be the crux of it.

1536
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,640
I can get into more supposition about cloning and consciousness transfer,

1537
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,520
but again, going back to the chat about how they cannot recreate the spirit

1538
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,300
and all that, which I think they cannot, as far as I can tell.

1539
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:59,720
And I want to just attach this before we wind this down.

1540
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,560
When you hear all of this talk about AI,

1541
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,140
they're not talking about a machine that can think,

1542
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,800
because your spirit is your mind, which is your intelligence.

1543
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,480
They're thinking about how they can develop that, a spirit, a mind, from scratch,

1544
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,160
or in situ, meaning in place.

1545
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:24,260
All that AI talk is you can network computers to appear to have emotions,

1546
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,020
but they're not going to be sentient machines like HAL 9000.

1547
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:32,760
Even HAL 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey was still just a dumb machine, ultimately.

1548
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,540
Right. Ultimately, that's what it is.

1549
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,800
So here's where the differentiation comes in.

1550
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,700
Here's where, again, I almost have to look at science fiction, right?

1551
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,400
And this is how it ties to cloning directly, again.

1552
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:53,680
There is a difference between mimicking something and literally copying it and creating it.

1553
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,640
These are three different things, to my mind.

1554
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,800
So HAL there is trying to mimic.

1555
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,700
It's a rudimentary attempt to mimic.

1556
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,660
It's mimicry, right.

1557
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:10,400
And now copying is a different story here, where you can actually copy it.

1558
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,520
It is the thing, but it's only a copy.

1559
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:17,140
So it's a good representation of it, but it's not the actual thing, like you were talking about.

1560
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,660
Well, go ahead with the copy, just to interject.

1561
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,560
When you copy, there's two ways.

1562
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,960
There's a replication and a duplication.

1563
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:25,540
Okay.

1564
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,000
So a replication would be 99.999%,

1565
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,500
but a duplication would be exactly like just what the word means, dupled two.

1566
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,440
You've made another one that's exact.

1567
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,180
Okay, fair enough.

1568
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:44,360
So when I say copy, what I'm talking about is replication, where it's nearly there.

1569
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,280
Very close.

1570
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:45,560
Right.

1571
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,960
Okay, so copying is replication.

1572
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:50,660
Mimicry is a different story.

1573
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:50,960
Go ahead.

1574
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,360
The key is mimicry, just like when they tell you it's a car bomb

1575
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,640
and it's a 30-foot crater that requires five tons on a Nissan Sentra.

1576
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,080
No way.

1577
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,000
Well, that's why I was trying to circle back to it.

1578
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,920
Okay, so you've got the copying, as I said, but more accurately, I should have said replication,

1579
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,020
because it's a replicant.

1580
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,860
It's almost right.

1581
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,720
It's almost there.

1582
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,580
Right, versus a duplicate.

1583
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,080
I think they have the replications.

1584
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,600
I don't have the duplications.

1585
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:22,380
Yeah, that's where I was going, because duplication is very similar to transfer

1586
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,600
because it does recreate the thing, right?

1587
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,880
Yeah, let's say, like, a duplicate would be, in a rough sense, but pretty accurate, identical twins.

1588
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:33,380
Yeah.

1589
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,860
Two different people, but they're identical, and they are connected.

1590
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,160
Slight variation, yeah, and connected.

1591
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,460
Slight variation, but they are connected.

1592
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:49,260
Okay, but to actually do it so that you have something that is indiscernible from the original, that's different.

1593
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,340
It's a duplicate, yeah.

1594
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:50,960
That's a duplicate.

1595
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,380
Okay, so really I need four categories here.

1596
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:58,220
I need replication, duplication, and then transfer is a different category, is it not?

1597
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:58,900
Yeah.

1598
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:09,040
Yeah, you can rest assured that that's been done since the 1930s, as Donald Marshall talks about.

1599
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:09,320
Okay.

1600
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:15,820
Because I get that intuitively, and there is something about intuition that people have turned off,

1601
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:21,180
and I suggest that you turn on your intuition again and start relying on it.

1602
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:24,220
If you can bridge it with logic and reason.

1603
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:35,200
Well, right, and I would say that because it's been so heavily repeated, the concept of transference is in existence,

1604
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:40,700
because people talk about it all the time, even if it's, well, you know what, the spirit leaves the body, it goes somewhere else.

1605
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:49,840
That's transference, whatever the system is, whatever the idea is, maybe that's natural transference, but that's transference, right?

1606
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:54,560
So that happens, but this idea –

1607
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:57,020
No, they're mystified by it.

1608
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,940
Okay, you're talking about the mimicry.

1609
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:00,880
Let's go back with that.

1610
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,760
When they say this guy's a magician, he's not.

1611
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,640
He's pulling a trick.

1612
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,080
He's not really creating a rabbit out of a hat.

1613
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,360
No, but he's mimicking the appearance of that thing happening.

1614
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,820
Right, by distracting you, just like the people, again, not leaning on it too much.

1615
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:18,100
You can make anyone believe anything if you put them in a traumatic situation.

1616
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:18,840
For sure.

1617
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:20,680
Pickpockets do this all the time.

1618
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,600
A pregnant woman that bumps into you really hard, nearly knocks you over, takes your wallet.

1619
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,580
You turn around and you're like, wait a second, did she fill me up?

1620
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,000
Who is that?

1621
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:30,420
Oh, pregnant.

1622
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1623
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,680
That's how the pickpockets work, right?

1624
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,460
So it's just a distraction.

1625
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:42,100
You can make people believe that if you traumatize them enough, during that time of trauma,

1626
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,480
they talk about this in sex magic with orgasm,

1627
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:50,280
during that time, there's a coherence that is incoherent with the rest of your existence,

1628
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,580
that things can be injected into the mind that you will hold onto,

1629
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,340
and you can even make believe that you saw it and you were there and you really weren't.

1630
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,160
That's the concept of trauma.

1631
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:06,280
So you could have anything happen, whether it's the World Trade Center or the alien invasion.

1632
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,480
No one saw flying saucers, but if you were there and you just saw the ground open up

1633
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,540
and justify anything that was on it,

1634
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,900
if you go home and everyone says, here, look on TV, there's a flying saucer,

1635
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,300
I missed that.

1636
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,860
I didn't see that I was there, but I guess everyone says it was.

1637
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,120
I'm still shaking from it.

1638
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,400
I guess there was a flying saucer.

1639
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,800
Idiot me, I didn't see it.

1640
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,640
Well, you're going to graft that into your experience because now it's an additional piece.

1641
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:35,020
You see, the memory is always subject to revision, too, because now people say they recall that.

1642
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,100
They don't recall that.

1643
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:43,080
They have taken in new information and grafted it or applied it.

1644
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,480
Because they want approval.

1645
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,420
Everyone's looking for approval.

1646
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,180
Hey, honey, how do I look in this clothes?

1647
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,620
Part of the equation, yeah, definitely part of the equation.

1648
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:57,580
But back to this, when we're talking about cloning, though, this has come incrementally,

1649
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:02,060
it seems, closer and closer to having command of replication.

1650
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,340
I don't think they've gotten to replication yet.

1651
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,700
I think, again, mimicry is on some level.

1652
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:08,780
Excuse me.

1653
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,200
Yeah, replication is one thing.

1654
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,180
Duplication, right, right, right.

1655
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,240
Thank you for correcting me.

1656
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,000
The exact, yeah, because otherwise the article of the Egyptians being able to make clones

1657
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,800
would not be identifiable.

1658
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:21,360
No.

1659
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,720
But it's close enough.

1660
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,520
Here's the thing.

1661
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:30,040
The tolerances are so low on this stuff that you can tell people, even people that were there,

1662
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,960
convince them that you didn't see what you saw, and they'll go for it,

1663
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,700
as long as it's coming from, quote, unquote, someone authoritative, right?

1664
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,820
Oh, yeah, well, we talked about that before.

1665
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:44,420
The financial system and the legal system is based on that completely.

1666
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,600
Look, I've gone over this before.

1667
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,060
I have a minus 1,000 in my bank account, right?

1668
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,500
Remember, I think people here have heard this already.

1669
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,300
Look, if you're getting government checks and you go to the Treasury website

1670
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,900
and they're $28 trillion in debt, they can't write you a check for a dollar.

1671
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:06,080
Even if someone gave them $28 trillion to go to zero, they still can't write you a check for a dollar.

1672
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,780
If you're a government employee, how are you getting your salary?

1673
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,860
How are you getting benefit checks?

1674
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,340
This is so in your face.

1675
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:17,260
It couldn't be any more.

1676
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,140
It's a 2,000-pound gorilla in the room, and no one notices that.

1677
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,300
These things are used as gauges, by the way.

1678
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:28,660
They could easily, by the way, just like Federal Reserve internal accounting is not made public,

1679
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,140
they could easily say you need to pass certain screening

1680
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:36,040
and have a certain password to get on the Treasury website to see what the debt is.

1681
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,520
They could do that very easily.

1682
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,980
If you want to look up someone's Social Security number that you know you can't do it,

1683
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,900
but if you're working in the DA's office, you could do that instantly.

1684
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,840
They could make it so you don't have access to what the national debt is very easily.

1685
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:51,920
It would be accepted.

1686
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,780
The average person can only look up a Social Security number on somebody's debt.

1687
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,700
But at this point, they could easily hide what the debt is

1688
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,280
and tell you for whatever reason people will buy it.

1689
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,360
But why do they make it public?

1690
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:07,840
Because they want to tell you, hey, dummy, we're telling you this whole thing is so fake.

1691
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,060
The people are acting illogically completely.

1692
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,040
And by the way, you notice how the politicians never talk about the debt?

1693
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:16,920
Never?

1694
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,140
Because there is none.

1695
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,680
It's all perceived.

1696
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,100
That's the problem.

1697
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:25,780
Because, look, if there really was a debt, it would work exactly like your average person's bank account works.

1698
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:29,480
If you're $28 overdrawn, guess what you can't do?

1699
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:30,460
Cash another check.

1700
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,440
Or whatever.

1701
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,260
Or whatever.

1702
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,420
It's so in your face.

1703
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,680
So is the cloning in our face?

1704
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,520
I would say yes.

1705
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,060
Do we know enough about it to point them out?

1706
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:41,380
No.

1707
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:46,560
But we know enough about, let's say, it's plausible that it exists,

1708
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,140
and that might be the way to explain some things that we see,

1709
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,440
especially the minimal security apparatus around dignitaries and famous people.

1710
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,520
Thank you.
