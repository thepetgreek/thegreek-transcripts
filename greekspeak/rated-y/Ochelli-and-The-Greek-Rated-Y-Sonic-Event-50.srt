1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
The Sonic 50 Jubilee and Ocelli in the Greek.

2
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,980
So we forgive anyone who hasn't signed up yet.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,960
Do we?

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,080
Anyway, I'm just joking.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Do we forget?

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,380
I don't.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,700
Anyway.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,340
Yeah.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:37,680
Yeah.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,360
You see what I mean?

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,900
It's just one of those things, right?

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,080
It's 50.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:41,580
Okay.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:41,940
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,260
I'm just throwing things out here.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,560
Look, I want to have some fun tonight, and we're going to do that, and we're going to

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,460
explain some things, or you're going to explain some things, but let's kick it off with something

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,620
just to get it out of the way.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,220
I did a drawing for the Aquius Argentum among memberships at the website, and the funny

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,300
thing is I drew the same name with two different methodologies, so I'm assuming that that should

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,780
be the winner.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,080
Now, hold on.

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,580
Didn't I say when you started, I had a vision that the same person came up on two methodologies

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,420
and who it was and what time you did it, and you were like, wow, yeah.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,560
That's exactly right.

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,240
Isn't that funny?

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,560
Yeah.

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:21,720
Yeah.

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,520
Here's the messed up part.

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,860
I started telling the Greek this after we were done recording.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,940
I said, you know, Greek, listen.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,200
I did a drawing, and he said, wait, wait, wait.

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,880
Hold on a second.

35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,900
You drew it twice.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,980
I said, yeah.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,700
I didn't tell him anything yet.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,260
I just said I did it, because he said, did you get to that yet?

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,280
I said, yeah, I did, and then he said, well, okay, so you drew the same name twice.

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,060
I said, yes, I did, then he started to tell me what time of day I did it, and he was correct

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,480
again.

42
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,200
Now, I didn't communicate any of this to him.

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,480
I love when that stuff happens.

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
This is what I keep telling people.

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,960
Time is not linear.

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,060
You know what it's like?

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,140
It's like when you go to the shops, and something's up on a shelf too high, and you figure out

48
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,880
how you're going to grab it, because you don't want to wait for a clerk to get a ladder.

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,039
That's what time is like.

50
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,980
I hear you, and look, sometimes, I mean, look, it's rare for things like that to come to me,

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,520
and most people can't pick things off of me like that, so it was really weird.

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,880
I was like, wow, how did you know all this?

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,060
But it was very strange.

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,280
I used two completely different methodologies.

55
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,980
I used a random number generator, just for the record, and then I had Frankie, the boy

56
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:36,820
here, my offspring, select a number, and both times, we got the same number and the same

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,160
person.

58
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,080
Actually, no, it's a funny thing.

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,220
There was a difference in numbers.

60
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,920
Different numbers, yeah, but the same person.

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,400
But the same person came.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,260
It was a random, random, not a random, yeah, not a random selection, but each selection

63
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,460
was random in itself.

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Well, right, because the random number generator, and plus, I have no idea what's in the mind

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,180
of a nine-year-old boy.

66
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,100
I just asked him to pick a number off a list.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,400
That was it, and there you go, boom.

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,660
Same person came up.

69
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,480
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,160
We got a lot.

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,840
I think the person doesn't mind, we'll just use their first name, Joe, I think.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,580
That's correct.

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,420
Now, there's more than one Joe who's a subscriber, but he's already been contacted.

74
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,360
He knows who he is, and yes, indeed, Joe is going to get that, and really fascinating,

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,020
because I drew him twice somehow.

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,460
I'm not sure why that happened, but I figured I'd note that.

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,220
Now, let's get to something that was in the chat room, and I think is important, and might

78
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,120
require some more clarity, because, again, this is rarefied information.

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,420
This is stuff you're not going to hear anywhere else at all, at all, okay?

80
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,700
You'll hear some version of this, maybe some sort of the same words in a scramble together,

81
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,880
but quite frankly, this idea about your inner voice, you hear about this all the time, right?

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,580
The secret, you got to listen to it, you got to listen to your inner voice, that's your

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,060
higher self, your blah, blah, blah, all of this nonsense in the woo-woo world.

84
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,740
Not the way the Greek explains it, and you have explained it before, and you have talked

85
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,080
about this inner voice, but there was a question there, so I wonder if you wouldn't mind going

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,840
over that some, and maybe providing us with a little bit more information, go ahead.

87
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,600
Now, that must have come up in the chat, or was it an email?

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,060
Well, it was both, actually.

89
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Oh, okay, I'm curious, because the reason I asked that is because in the chat, someone

90
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,360
was fastidious enough to go back and hit maybe a month, or two, or three, and do a screenshot

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,440
of an answer that I gave, and let me just pull that up, and the inner voice, well, yes, voices,

92
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,600
any voices that you hear distinctly, especially the ones that sound like you, are not you.

93
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,580
You don't need a voice to talk to yourself.

94
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,380
One of the analogies, I don't know if I could find, maybe I'll find it.

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
Well, you go ahead and look for it for a second, but I mean, the thing is, this came up before

96
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,140
on a previous Sonic, and you started to explain that at a certain age, you do have your own

97
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,280
inner voice, it is there, but then it goes away, it goes silent.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,980
Do you really want to do a whole recap on it?

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,340
All right, let's do a quick recap.

100
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,140
I think it would be worth it, yeah, because this is something that might be a little confusing.

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,640
Like I said, they're not hearing this from anywhere else, so it's not like they've heard

102
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,420
it before, unless they heard it on one of these Sonics, and I don't remember covering this

103
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,980
on the original Ocelli in the Greek, actually.

104
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah, let's end up with, okay, you know when the cell phone's low, and you got to give important

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,520
information, and the phone dies, but you had enough time to get some words in, so why don't

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,660
you just put the important stuff out first, even though it might seem out of context,

107
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,060
so the message gets across.

108
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,440
When you have an inner voice, most people don't think of it that way, but if you consider

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,620
that, you know, you're aware of it now, if you anticipate it, it stops, it goes silent.

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,940
That's proof enough, more than theory, that it's not you, right?

111
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,500
It's kind of like when someone's jabbering, and you tell them, go on, they stop, right?

112
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,020
Go on, go on, they stop, and you think it would encourage them, but you're anticipating

113
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,720
more like, oh, wait a second, you said go on because I'm just rambling, right?

114
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah, exactly, right?

115
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,620
It's like a reverse psychology, right?

116
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,060
If you indicate to, and it's sort of a weird indication where it's like, look, all you're

117
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,760
doing is making noise, but please proceed, that's usually my phrase, and please proceed

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,180
quite often stops people from speaking, they just go, oh, never mind.

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:26,320
But what about the same psychology works, spirit, study of the spirit, knowledge of the spirit

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
works with the inner voice.

121
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,880
If you find yourself on the toilet, on your way to work, in the shower, before you lay

122
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,140
down, or as you're laying down, or having whatever you're doing, and that voice starts

123
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,960
to be prominent, anticipate it, say, okay, I hear you, what else do you have to say?

124
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,040
As if you're a third party and watch what happens, or listen to what happens, it goes

125
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,800
totally silent.

126
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,460
And then you have this refreshing moment of, should I call it clarity, but it is clarity,

127
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,020
but it's not recognized as clarity.

128
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,580
Let's just call it silence, right?

129
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Right.

130
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,020
It is silence.

131
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,100
Well, the analogy that I gave is the voice that we're given, it sounds like us and changes,

132
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,900
I'll get into that.

133
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,420
It's kind of like reading a billboard, reading a newspaper, reading a monitor where you see

134
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,000
a contrast with the black ink on white paper, right?

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Or you get to read the font, different sizes, right?

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,200
The inner voice is more like Braille, where there is no sight, and you have to read Braille

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,340
by touch, and you have to learn that, right?

138
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,620
It's different, right?

139
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,140
It's a different sense completely.

140
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,120
But both communicate, both are communicative, right?

141
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,680
Ask someone who reads Braille, right?

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,960
But it has to be learned.

143
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,280
Now what happens is when we come into the world, there's a lot of theories of, I like

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,580
the Jack Fresco, when people ask him, what happens after you die, he says, what do you

145
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,500
remember from 500 years ago?

146
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,440
Nothing, usually, right?

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,200
Put the airy-fairy hypnosis stuff away.

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Nothing.

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
So that's what happens when you die, it's just nothingness, right?

150
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,080
To a degree.

151
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,740
There's all these theories, but what I suggest, and I was having a conversation with a very

152
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,580
intelligent individual yesterday, engineering type person, whose subject of death came up,

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,620
and when we come here, we're kind of given a mind wipe, and it's as if we're raw and

154
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,160
ignorant and have to figure things out based on the environment.

155
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,680
And when I say the environment, I mean the culture as well, what culture you grow up

156
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,000
in, right?

157
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,420
And environment, I mean in total.

158
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,040
Environment meaning the physical, geographical, the family, the village, the city, the town,

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
the culture, all language, the history, when you were.

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,419
We have to figure it out on our own.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,280
We don't know anything.

162
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Now, just to make the point and paraphrase the conversation I had yesterday is this.

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,920
If we had the memory of being outside of this realm and what was previous, everyone would

164
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,940
seemingly be far more intelligent, forthright, and a lot more stuff would get done the right

165
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,440
way, but then we'd end up with a really sterile world, because everything would be right, pretty

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,680
much, or on a higher level, and it would seem sterile.

167
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,060
Ergo, when you watch someone, some poor sap is like a farmer out in the field, the UFO

168
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,240
comes up, picks him up with a light beam and takes him to another planet of advanced civilization,

169
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
and talking about Hollywood now, right?

170
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,400
You see a story like that.

171
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,720
When they take him to the advanced planet, doesn't everything seem a lot more sterile

172
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,740
on that advanced planet than Earth?

173
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,460
Yeah, that's true, always, yeah.

174
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:35,640
The way advanced society is always so clean that it's scary clean, it's very shiny, everything

175
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,880
looks brand new.

176
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,180
Minimalist.

177
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, minimalist.

178
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,260
Everything's taken care of.

179
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,220
Yeah, everything is just handled.

180
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,020
That's true.

181
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,480
I think a part of what you're describing, though, about being reborn and forgetting

182
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,840
and all that, it sounds very similar to what Native American spiritualists say about being

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,140
born.

184
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,300
The idea that when you come into this world in a state of forgetfulness, something like

185
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,420
that they had said to me, because I tried to listen very carefully to what some of those

186
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,900
guys had to say years ago when I spent time with some of them, and it's very interesting

187
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,000
that it sounds exactly the same as what you said, just slightly different language where

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,120
you're saying about getting into the culture and this and that.

189
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,120
They certainly would say that the world around you would begin to teach you what is, and you

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,960
will learn from it, and then you'll begin to remember, but not everything.

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
You're not meant to remember it all.

192
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,860
And that's the kind of things they would say to me, and it sounds like, you know, very cryptic.

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,880
It's a common theme amongst many cultures and many theorists, philosophers, spiritualists.

194
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,660
Okay, so let's go on.

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,740
The reason we brought up the death and coming in is so you're here as an infant.

196
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:51,080
Now, one of the reasons you can't remember infantile thoughts, pre-formative years, formative

197
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,300
years, I call like, usually between four and nine or 10.

198
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,060
And before that, you never notice, when the infants are really young, they are very similar

199
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,460
looking and you know, there's some are different, you know, there you have to, you could size

200
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,700
them up, you know, like they size people up from short in size order.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,340
Yeah, sure.

202
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,640
You could do that with infants, too.

203
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,140
But there's something that they have in common, which is extremely infantile.

204
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,480
You don't remember much from there, or from that time in your life.

205
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,840
It's because that is when you're totally in that raw state.

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,740
Like you just got zapped, and you're brought here, but there is a connection to who you

207
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,980
are and thought process.

208
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,000
I think on the last Sonic, I mentioned how the babies, one baby was rambling, and the

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,280
other ones were looking at him and baby, you know, rambling baby talk, right?

210
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,060
And when he stopped, they all laughed like he was telling a joke.

211
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,100
And it was exactly choreographed looking like it was if you choreographed it for a TV commercial,

212
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,940
they make things, edit things and stage things to look a certain way.

213
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,920
It's exactly what exactly what it looked like a baby telling a joke and the other ones laughing

214
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,680
their asses off.

215
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,740
Like you could have easily like in other words, you could have easily dubbed over like the

216
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,620
guy going, hey, two Jews walk into a bar and then a voiceover comes over and messes up

217
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,360
the joke a little bit.

218
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,300
But then you can tell he tells the punchline and they all laughed all at once.

219
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,000
Exactly.

220
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,560
Edit that together.

221
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,320
And it would look very sensible and orderly for the commercial.

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,020
OK, gotcha.

223
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,300
Good.

224
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,440
It almost looked like a TV commercial and it was surreal.

225
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,220
And I said, oh, my gosh, they have their own language and it's cogent and it has a lot

226
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,160
of information and so much that you could actually form a joke in a punchline.

227
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,520
Right.

228
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,440
Because when you have a primitive language, you probably don't have jokes and punchlines

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,120
because it's primitive.

230
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,580
You're just struggling to communicate when you develop humor and jokes and punchlines.

231
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,100
It means that you reach an advanced stage of communication with a lot of color and soliloquy

232
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,620
and then themes.

233
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:38,900
Right.

234
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,820
There's a certain level of sophistication you have to get to to get into, you know, using

235
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,300
metaphor and all these other things.

236
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,240
This is more complex than just pointing at something and going rock.

237
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:47,920
Yeah.

238
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,600
So I've discovered that exists in baby talk.

239
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,840
Right.

240
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,820
But we forget that.

241
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,120
Right.

242
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,160
So go ahead and speak the baby talk.

243
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,460
Right.

244
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,220
You know, so we can only, you know, sound like we're not saying anything, kind of like

245
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,340
when you bark at a dog or meow to a cat, they look at you like, what are you trying to do?

246
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:02,960
Right.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,460
Just speak.

248
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,880
Just speak your regular language.

249
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,900
You know, you're not doing it.

250
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,080
Right.

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,340
Because most of the bark and the meow is inaudible anyway to us.

252
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,380
What I would suggest, though, is if you understand the size parameters in ham radio where antenna

253
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:23,200
lengths matter, there's something about the body that when it develops to a certain age

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
and we begin to have that inner thought that we think is ours and our voice is actually

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,140
beings that are on this plane, but a very ethereal plane.

256
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,420
In other words, they don't see our physical body just like we don't see invisible gases.

257
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,460
We could walk through them.

258
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,140
It's the inverse.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,900
But they see our intent.

260
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,040
They see our thoughts as physical things because they're not physical.

261
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,280
So the nonphysical aspect of us is physical in their realm.

262
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,860
One theory is that this earth was dropped into their world physically.

263
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,680
This earth bounced off of another solar system into this solar system and it fell into the

264
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,740
line where their world already exists.

265
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,360
Right.

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,760
Right.

267
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,340
And but the physical part doesn't disturb them because they're energetic, but they see

268
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,280
all our energetic qualities and they're pretty advanced.

269
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,420
And they said, well, wow, this is the way our reality goes now.

270
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,920
So let's have fun with these humans.

271
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,300
Right.

272
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,360
So what they do is they give us a voice and we think the voice is us because it actually

273
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,300
sounds like us also now when they give us a voice, there's a mind behind that voice,

274
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,600
meaning let's just say a simple deduction.

275
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,200
When I say mind, it's like your level of education, your level of awareness, your level of whatever

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,120
your tastes.

277
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,600
Right.

278
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,120
OK.

279
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,740
And at this point, let's just keep the juvenile tastes and things like that.

280
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:46,020
When you develop your body changes again to pre-adulthood adolescence, they usually switch

281
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,820
up and another one takes over.

282
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,140
That is the adolescent voice.

283
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,820
All right.

284
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,040
That's why people in stages of their lives from childhood, adolescent to adult, young

285
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,060
adult, middle age and then older.

286
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,180
They feel like different people sometimes.

287
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,960
And you see this in society, by the way, oh, I'm having a middle age crisis or whatever.

288
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,240
Right.

289
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,820
You've heard of that.

290
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,000
Right.

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,760
So go out and buy a fancy car at 60 years old or whatever.

292
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,480
Fifty five.

293
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:08,720
Right.

294
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,280
I think in your 50s is when they had their midlife crisis.

295
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,660
Right.

296
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:11,940
Yeah.

297
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,080
Between the 40s, between 40 and 60.

298
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,480
Usually.

299
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes.

300
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah.

301
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,520
Yeah.

302
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,620
This answers a lot of things that the rebelliousness of certain age groups and the yeah, the playfulness

303
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,260
of others.

304
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,520
Right.

305
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,700
This is all trained in these other beings that influence us.

306
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,600
And that sounds crazy.

307
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:27,940
Some.

308
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,960
But you follow it.

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,540
Follow it through.

310
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,080
So you notice that when you go past the formative years, let's say nine, 10, 11, become an adolescent.

311
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,740
What else changes is your physical length, the physical size of the body, different frequencies.

312
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,420
Just like the ham radio.

313
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,820
You change the antenna position and length and you get a different frequency.

314
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,080
Then the thought processes change again and they bring another individual.

315
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,040
You become an adult and they switch out to another individual.

316
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:01,140
Fortunately for them, let's say for economy of economy of exchange, in some ways exchanging

317
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,660
these beings.

318
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,740
I have gone on many sonic events for over two decades saying that most people stop maturing

319
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,880
at about nine or 12 years old between there.

320
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,540
OK.

321
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:10,880
Yeah.

322
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,360
Yeah.

323
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,820
That's so it's pretty easy for these guys to leave you to stick you with the nine or

324
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,820
12 year old entity that gives you the voice for the rest of your life.

325
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,560
Right.

326
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,960
And I'm talking about most of the people you'll ever meet, even their 70s or 80s, if you actually

327
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,120
objectively analyze them, you'll see that their mentality is pretty much the same as

328
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,780
it was since high school.

329
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,860
You might interpret it this way.

330
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,640
You'll see that no matter what age people are, they always have the ability to be what

331
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,920
we would call childish about things.

332
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,640
And it's like odd to me.

333
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,980
It's like, isn't this more mature a person than to get involved with this name calling

334
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,420
or nonsense that I'm saying?

335
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Sure.

336
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,820
But that's a little more complicated, believe it or not.

337
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,020
What I'm suggesting here is they never get to.

338
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,920
We look at them as adults because of the age on their driver's license or the way they

339
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,780
appear or whatever or whatever position they hold in society.

340
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,660
But I'm telling you, they're infant and immature young adult high school mentality.

341
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,099
I'm talking about attorney generals, scientists, politicians.

342
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,359
You know, I once met who was it was a it was a former judge slash politician.

343
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,119
And I thought he had this teenager kind of attitude, high school kind of attitude because

344
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,220
he was a public person.

345
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,540
Well, I had conversations with him in person.

346
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,400
He was just like this.

347
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,820
Oh, my gosh, this guy stopped growing at 13 years old.

348
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,060
You see.

349
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,380
And if you have parents or grandparents or people are older, just sit down, listen to

350
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,780
some Greek, speak for a few days and then go talk to them and tell me I'm wrong, right?

351
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,620
I don't think so.

352
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,160
And I'll tell you another weird thing, though, that I'd like you to address here right here,

353
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,100
actually, is that when you're like, say, 20 years old and you're a little older than

354
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,280
me.

355
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,700
So you've already experienced this.

356
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,660
But when you're like, say, 20 years old and you look at, you know, say, 20 year old women,

357
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,840
they appear to be full grown adult women to you, generally speaking.

358
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,620
And then you get to be 30, 40, 50.

359
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,580
To me, I look back at a 20 year old woman now and I say to myself, that looks like a

360
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,400
child, a high school child.

361
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,660
Yeah.

362
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:10,980
Yeah.

363
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,560
A high school child at best.

364
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,520
Now they look like children to me, and yet they were fully realized adults when I was

365
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,500
in that age group.

366
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,900
Your perspective can change as well about your view of other people just looking at

367
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,840
the surface even.

368
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,780
But that presentation does happen where at a certain point, you know, you're looking at

369
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,440
a matured person physically, but that doesn't always follow that they behave like a mature

370
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,740
person physically.

371
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,060
Right.

372
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,160
I mean, mentally, emotionally, it's not and they don't.

373
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,620
And most societies like that.

374
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,660
OK, so let's carry on.

375
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,340
So let's take an individual that decides to mature beyond whether they take a professional

376
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,420
career or they they're autodidactic, teach themselves and they evolve, let's say their

377
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,920
awareness.

378
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,940
And when I say awareness, OK, the more you learn about the scene, the more you will also

379
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,260
learn about the unseen.

380
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,900
More will come to you.

381
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,780
So what I mean by that is like, you know, most people don't know how the money system

382
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,500
works at all.

383
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,880
And they feel like they have to pay taxes to keep society going.

384
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,280
Right.

385
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,880
They haven't lifted a finger to it doesn't.

386
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,700
And they all know at the same time, they all know at the same time money is created.

387
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,480
It's fiat.

388
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,380
They're told that.

389
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,660
Right.

390
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:19,960
Right.

391
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,580
So but they never put the two together.

392
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,340
So they're so they're one theory or one thing they believe does not match the other.

393
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,560
So people say, oh, you have to pay taxes to keep the buses and trains and schools going.

394
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,540
But yeah, I know the money.

395
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,400
They draw it out of thin air.

396
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,580
So you got to put those two thoughts together, man.

397
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,840
They cancel out.

398
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,200
Right.

399
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,280
You see.

400
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,880
So what's this?

401
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,920
So they're making you they threaten you if you don't pay taxes, nothing to do with running

402
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,900
the municipalities.

403
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,420
It has to do with something else.

404
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,940
What is that?

405
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,040
And they can't they can't put it together because it's not like you have to come up with why

406
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,660
they're doing it.

407
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,700
Just put the two together.

408
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,600
You see, it goes to zero.

409
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,040
You're ground.

410
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,940
This is the same with anything, with the human body, what the doctors tell you, what they

411
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,320
tell you about history.

412
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,360
And none of it adds up.

413
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,060
Right.

414
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,780
So the people are keeping everything bifurcated.

415
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,420
They have two thoughts that are contrary to each other in the same category.

416
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,900
Right.

417
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,860
Whether it's like taxes or the body.

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,640
Right.

419
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,300
Or whatever.

420
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,800
You know, they have one thought here that they oh, you have to need this to absorb nutrition.

421
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,900
But they already know if you look at it at a diagram of the intestine, there's no way

422
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,540
anything to go through.

423
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,360
So they maintain these these opposite poles, not more than polar opposite.

424
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,060
They're not poles.

425
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,800
They're like canceling opposites, like anti and pro.

426
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,460
If you put them together, they cancel out.

427
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,180
They maintain this in their mind their whole life and they never go forward.

428
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,060
So that's what I mean about the more you learn about what is seen, the more you will learn

429
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,120
about the unseen.

430
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,080
Because, for example, back to the money, you could find out pretty much all the propaganda

431
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,040
they tell you that taxes pay for for services and things and employees of the government

432
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,440
and all that.

433
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,100
But it's the same people that put that out, put out that it's a fiat currency.

434
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,820
But they don't put out what happens when you put the two together and you end up with zero.

435
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,920
Then why are they so stringent about why do they take it as serious as a heart attack for

436
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,800
you to pay taxes when there's nothing to pay with and it doesn't pay?

437
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,860
They don't give you that.

438
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,580
But once you put the two together and they cancel out now, it will what will come to you

439
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,100
is immediately so simple why they're doing it.

440
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,280
Right.

441
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,600
It's a control mechanism.

442
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:22,960
Right.

443
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,280
So and then and it's but it's unspoken.

444
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,240
So all of these unspoken things that exist in the realm will come together when you start

445
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
studying everything that has been put in front of you already.

446
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,240
That's what the whole premise of Greek speak is.

447
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,920
Right.

448
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,520
If you want to join a religion or science or a profession or anything like that, go see

449
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,720
what's been written about it and, you know, go ahead and read everything.

450
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,380
But you don't read everything word for word.

451
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,100
You just go through all the material, right, get your conclusions together.

452
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,980
And then you will start to see more and more and more.

453
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,280
OK.

454
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,360
An individual like that, which this is more of a spiritual awareness maturity, the beings

455
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,900
that give that dominate and give the inner voice, they got they got to go to a specialty

456
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,600
one now.

457
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,020
They got to go to another being that handles those people.

458
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,980
Right.

459
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,340
Because that's not normal.

460
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,900
This guy.

461
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,780
So the regular ones that are around that give everyone their regular voices, they got to

462
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,700
go to a professional guy to give this guy his inner voice.

463
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,580
But if you know that this inner voice is still a foreigner and by anticipation and you test

464
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,140
it, now they got to go to an even higher one.

465
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,280
This is where you hear about the demons, right?

466
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,860
You hear about when you exercise a demon, he comes back with a worse one, right?

467
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,080
Comes back later with his buddy.

468
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,720
It's kind of like the schoolyard thing.

469
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,580
You beat up someone in the schoolyard and a few days later you see the same guy you beat

470
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,160
up coming with two other friends and a big guy, you know, his brother now.

471
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,460
Right.

472
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,340
Yeah.

473
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,900
I was going to say a lot of times, a lot of times when I've knocked a bully on his ass

474
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,080
as a kid, what happens is they bring their older brother the next day.

475
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,280
And yeah.

476
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:05,920
Exactly.

477
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,780
Exactly.

478
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,460
It's the same scenario.

479
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:16,200
So once you start advancing and they are running out of candidates to substitute for the ones

480
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,960
that gave you the normal voice, then they bring in the big, the senior guys and, um,

481
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,040
they give you the voice too, but you know, it's you've busted them.

482
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,960
You already know it's an artificial voice when you hear something in your head that

483
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,360
sounds like your voice, right?

484
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,000
So then what they do is they mess with you a little bit.

485
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,020
They start giving you anticipatory thoughts, stuff of the future that's going to happen.

486
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,520
Kind of like what we did with the lottery thing.

487
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,780
Right.

488
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,960
So it's, this is a theory now, but so, so it'll be like, uh, you get up in the morning,

489
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,080
you got to go around town and do this and that, and you get this strong vision of a

490
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,980
red car, you know, uh, running over a cactus and, um, an old lady, you know, beating her

491
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,420
dog and you just get these visions in your head and you're like, what the hell, why,

492
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
why did I see that?

493
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,440
So you go out around town, you do your things and you see, um, this red Toyota Corolla station

494
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,380
where I can run into the media and knock down a big Swarovski cactus.

495
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
You're like, Oh, that was shocking.

496
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,880
You drive around a couple hours later, you're ready to go home and you see this old lady

497
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
crossing the street, hitting her dog.

498
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,200
And you're like, Oh my gosh, I saw this stuff.

499
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
I saw this on the way out.

500
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,240
These visions are put in my head and then I'm seeing, right.

501
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,940
So this is when, when you get to a certain level, these inner voices don't only give

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,460
you a voice.

503
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,860
They start giving you premonition stuff that's going to happen in the future to mess with

504
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,880
you because of this.

505
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,700
I need to ask something because here's another thing that I think messes with people and

506
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,720
it's about this inner voice and the way this works, because as you said, you don't need

507
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,900
a voice to talk to yourself.

508
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:58,560
But here's the thing when I dream, okay, uh, Greek and here's something that I realized

509
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,400
many years ago.

510
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,640
And when you said it to me on one of the Sonics years ago, I said, wow, you're like the only

511
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,820
person that I know that realizes this, I'm in the dream world, right?

512
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:15,340
And I realized that although I am receiving information, even from characters in my dreams,

513
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,540
all right, people I know, people who have passed, whatever else I'm receiving information

514
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,340
as if they were speaking to me in reality, based on my observation, their mouths are

515
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,860
not moving.

516
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,660
They're not actually speaking in the dream, but information is being communicated directly

517
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:37,060
to me in a very concise way so that I'm getting something as if even better, quite frankly,

518
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,800
than if that person, like I have been visited many times by people who have passed on in

519
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,320
my dreams.

520
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,240
And usually when they communicate information to me, whatever it may be regarding the situation

521
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,380
in the dream or life or whatever, I know they're not speaking, but they are communicating to

522
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,540
me.

523
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,600
One of the things that I mentioned is if you ever recall your dreams and there's dialogue,

524
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,640
look at the mouth and it's never moved.

525
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,360
It never moves.

526
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,680
Right.

527
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,600
People never brought that up before.

528
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
I knew that automatically.

529
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,780
So what I'm saying is there's a communication there, though, that is not through the standard.

530
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,940
There's somebody talking.

531
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,080
There's an actual voice.

532
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,280
No, there is communication there.

533
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,840
There are specific beings that do dreams also.

534
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,420
And then Native Americans knew about the dream weavers, catchers, whatever they made for

535
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,000
addressing that aspect, which is different than the conscious world.

536
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,420
Indeed.

537
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,760
But there's another level to it.

538
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,860
And I think Castaneda got into it, where if you can see your hands in your dreams and

539
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,980
move things around as simple as a light switch or picking up a mug of beer or doing something.

540
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,800
Now you're not only in a dream, but you're actually transcending to a different.

541
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,280
You're figuring out that you're actually going to a more energetic plane while you're unconscious.

542
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,140
One of the things I brought up is that all of the intelligence agencies and think tanks

543
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,680
that have been doing work on consciousness since the 50s, if you study what they it's

544
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,820
very clandestine.

545
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,140
It's hard to find the information.

546
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,080
Look around the Internet.

547
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,980
There's plenty of it.

548
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,240
The easiest one to find is the Monroe Institute, whatever.

549
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm not a big fan of them, but look at that anyway.

550
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,400
Right.

551
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,280
What I'm trying to say is the conclusion that they had is that a lot of it was inconclusive.

552
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,800
But what they did gather is that when we sleep, our consciousness is being used elsewhere.

553
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,520
Like Isak Pantov is a big proponent of that, right?

554
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:37,400
So P.D. Ospinsky, George Gorjev, all those guys talked about where everybody's asleep

555
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,180
here and you have to do the work, right?

556
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,720
So there's many ways of saying the same thing.

557
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,420
It's kind of like the ancient Chinese.

558
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,300
They say there are many paths to the top of the mountain, but the view is the same, right?

559
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,040
So find out what what is similar amongst various studies, and then that's what you end up with

560
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,760
seeing simply.

561
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,560
But what I'm trying to say, dreams are a whole other category, a completely different category.

562
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,160
But yes, what I what I suggest about dreams are very quick, a way to to move forward in

563
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,480
dreaming.

564
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,020
If you dream, I don't really dream very rarely.

565
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,100
But when I do, it's not like I would say it's a dream.

566
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,040
It's more like a very strong thought when I'm awake, right?

567
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,880
Or prior to waking, it's always prior to waking up or taking and I would be I would get something

568
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,120
while I'm a very short nap, like a cat nap type thing.

569
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,720
But the more I study, let's say things like scripture and ancient, the less I have no

570
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,200
dreams at all.

571
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,680
There was a time when I didn't have dreams for a decade, right?

572
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,920
So also now, because I'm focusing on certain projects that I'm not dreaming at all, right?

573
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,160
So but what I'd like to bring up to people based on the things that I've studied in absolute

574
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,240
from my experience with it is if there's dialogue, look for mouths moving.

575
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:00,020
If not, this is something that's being implanted by a dream being if you have the ability to

576
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:06,760
have tactile movement, meaning you can see yourself walking and you can see your hands

577
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,460
like Castaneda said at moving and doing things with your hands.

578
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,920
It's more than a dream.

579
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,680
It's actually you.

580
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,380
You've gone.

581
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,940
You're somewhere else.

582
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,560
It's ethereal.

583
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:15,980
Right.

584
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,620
I can tell you, I had one recently that was really powerful like that where I saw my hands

585
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,240
and I was conscious.

586
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,160
I was like, oh, I see my hands.

587
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,080
That means this is not a dream.

588
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,160
Then I look up and there's this long wooden table like medieval, right?

589
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,980
Big room, castle like what I was talking about, I made White Castle, Hamburg, Chateau

590
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,260
Blanc.

591
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,560
Right.

592
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah.

593
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,960
And there's a horse sitting on the on the ends of the table.

594
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,980
And they're actually sitting like human style.

595
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,360
And they they have hooves and they put their hooves through us like a beer stein.

596
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,620
That's about two feet tall.

597
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,080
That's designed to be picked up with a hoof.

598
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,780
And they and they took a sip from it.

599
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,440
And they look at me and said, toast to us, Greek toast to us, Greek.

600
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,980
I said, this is this shit is crazy.

601
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,880
And I'm like, yeah, we know.

602
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,460
And I was out of it.

603
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:01,780
Wait a minute.

604
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,100
Was this before or after you and I had that discussion about the whole Williams offerings?

605
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,540
I think it was off air about Gulliver's Travels and the horse people was a couple of weeks

606
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,760
ago.

607
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,600
I think we brought it up.

608
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,760
I brought it up to you after I said the dream thing is crazy.

609
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,720
It wasn't even a dream.

610
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,540
And then the other thing I also brought up where I'm in a room and it's I see my hands

611
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,540
and I'm like, oh, there's a mirror and I look in the mirror and I'm like a five foot three

612
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:29,860
Latin guy, you know, like, you know, like your typical guys that you see that they show

613
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,180
on Fox News that cross the border illegally.

614
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,840
Yeah, of course.

615
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,120
Right.

616
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,580
Yeah.

617
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,200
Like that.

618
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
And I was like, that's not what I look like.

619
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,920
I look like Johnny Depp.

620
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,060
People tell me.

621
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,080
It's like, oh, my gosh, what am I playing?

622
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,920
You know, this is some crazy stuff.

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,060
You know, it's not like a passive dream.

624
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,780
This is where I'm interacting with it.

625
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,260
So I'm just sharing these things because maybe other people have it, too.

626
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,660
I really don't put a lot of credence into it.

627
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,660
I'm just sharing them.

628
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:54,960
Right.

629
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,460
Well, back to the voice.

630
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,740
Let's go back to the voice.

631
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,060
Yeah.

632
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,380
I'm sorry.

633
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,480
I'm sorry.

634
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,700
I offroaded there for a second.

635
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,020
It's just I recognize that the communication felt similar to what it is you're describing

636
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,860
here where you have communication and it's not because you're hearing a voice, but you

637
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,300
are being communicated to.

638
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,600
Yeah.

639
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,600
But let's just finish this part of the change and go back.

640
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,080
Dreams and the inner voice.

641
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,460
I have no there's no interrelation at all.

642
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
It's a completely different category.

643
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,200
OK.

644
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,680
Fair enough.

645
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,600
So we got into dreams.

646
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:21,840
Yeah.

647
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,920
Inner voice that people have when they're conscious through.

648
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,420
They has nothing to do with dreams.

649
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,420
It really doesn't because it's completely different beings, by the way.

650
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:28,860
OK.

651
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,500
So what I'm trying to say here is the voice, the beings that give you your inner voice

652
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,300
actually change as you change physically and mentally as you advance, they get more advanced

653
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,680
beings.

654
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,980
Right.

655
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,460
Of course.

656
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,500
Could you imagine someone who is more advanced, spiritually developed, let's say even physically

657
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,980
developed is into higher thinking, higher learning or whatever?

658
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,640
You can't give them like, you know, the guy who watches, you know, Monday Night Football

659
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,740
every night, drives the bus and plays the lotto.

660
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,740
And you know what I mean?

661
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,800
And is relying.

662
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,660
So what you do is when I retire, I'll get Social Security.

663
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,940
That's my whole thing in life.

664
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,160
You can't give him the same voice you give someone like that.

665
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,420
Right.

666
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,460
You'll go nuts.

667
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,420
Well, this is what creates crazy people.

668
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,040
And that's the other odd thing I wanted to ask you here is, are any of these inner voices

669
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,260
which you clearly said are not actually our voice, whether it sounds like us or not, is

670
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,640
irrelevant.

671
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,020
No, no, no.

672
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,020
It is relevant.

673
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,780
Oh, it is relevant.

674
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,100
OK.

675
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,500
Yeah.

676
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:22,940
Yeah.

677
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,200
It is.

678
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,460
OK.

679
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,740
OK.

680
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,080
The standard playbook is it's different.

681
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,620
Probably people that are hearing impaired, but the standard actually people that are hearing

682
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,280
impaired are probably at an advantage.

683
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,940
But what I'm trying to say here is that the way they play the trick on you is that you

684
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,460
pretty much audibly know what you sound like.

685
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,100
Typically, most people recognize their own voice and they play that in your head with

686
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,520
the tonality that you would be anticipating and hearing your own voice.

687
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,720
And that's what fools people.

688
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,840
Well, there was a point in my life.

689
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,160
I don't know about you, but there was a point in my life where I heard myself on tape and

690
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,180
I barely recognized my natural speaking voice because it does sound different inside of

691
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,620
my head.

692
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,940
But hang on just a quick second.

693
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,700
I just.

694
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:05,980
Yes.

695
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,180
Similar, but off.

696
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,040
It was like, wow, do I actually sound like I hate the sound of my voice?

697
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,700
Well, the sound of your voice is different when because, you know, you know, they have

698
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,780
this thing called bone headphones instead of a speaker on the ear that vibrates the bones

699
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,260
in your jaw, jawbone or something.

700
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,700
OK.

701
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,120
Right.

702
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,160
So when you're speaking, whether you hear it or not, you're feeling it.

703
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,380
You're actually not hearing what is terminating from the vocal cords in the end of your mouth,

704
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,600
in the air and to the room.

705
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,380
What you're really hearing mostly is the vibration of the bone structure, which is

706
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,100
kind of which has to sound different because now it's going to a different place.

707
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,380
OK.

708
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,340
There's a different tonality.

709
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,760
What other people are hearing when they hear you speak.

710
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:40,960
Right.

711
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,080
Actually, there's a way to do that.

712
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,080
You put your head.

713
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,540
You put a just go up to not a wall, but put something in front of you like a plate about

714
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,120
a foot away.

715
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,480
Right.

716
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,940
And speak into the plate.

717
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,340
And what you hear is what other people here typically that's more like what you sound

718
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:54,600
like.

719
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,820
Right.

720
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,300
OK.

721
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,760
You know, hold an object, your hands in front about a foot away from your face and speak

722
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,200
into it rather loud, not too loud, but enough to project.

723
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,680
And you'll notice it sounds that's what that's what you really sound like.

724
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:05,900
Right.

725
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,400
The audible part.

726
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:07,719
Right.

727
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,719
And what people also hear is the way you project and the reflections in the room and all that.

728
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:14,380
Right.

729
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,920
All of those things come into play.

730
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,659
So that's not the point.

731
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,260
They don't have to really duplicate your voice.

732
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,739
Exactly.

733
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,739
Fifty percent. Seventy five percent is all they have to do.

734
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,540
And here's the thing, who's going to question that?

735
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,420
It's not them in their mind anyway.

736
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,179
No one's going to question it. So they could be only 10 percent what you sound like.

737
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,040
It's close enough, you see, because you're not aware.

738
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,040
OK, fair enough. So here's the other thing, though, that I just wanted to ask quickly

739
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,380
and have you throw it in.

740
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:47,260
Are any of these inner voices, which are not ours, even though we think they're ours

741
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,780
quite often, are any of them actually benevolent or are they all?

742
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,560
They I'd say they're neutral.

743
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,100
They all. Oh, OK.

744
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,580
I was wondering if they provide both sides.

745
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,460
So, you know, the cartoon where you have a guy wants to do something questionable in

746
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,220
the cartoon and he's got an angel on his right hand, on the right shoulder and a devil

747
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,440
on the left shoulder. The angel says, don't do it.

748
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,180
It's immoral. And the devil says, go ahead and do it.

749
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,460
Nobody knows. Right. Right.

750
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Right. They provide they provide the moral argument, the moral stance and the immoral

751
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,880
stance. Also, they do both.

752
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,960
They have there is no right and wrong.

753
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,200
I've been saying this for a while. There is no right and wrong.

754
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,440
That's why it's important to find out what law form you will abide by.

755
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,680
So you have a reference system.

756
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,720
Right. OK. And most people do the state because they're because the state law form,

757
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,940
which is bizarre, but they do that because it's a fear of penalty.

758
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,400
Right. They're motivated by penalty.

759
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,380
They don't do the laws of the state or whatever state you're in because it's the right

760
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,960
thing. They do it because if they don't do it, they'll be punished.

761
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,340
Right. It's the motivation by penalty.

762
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,800
The law, what I'm talking about, law form is something that motivates you because it's

763
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,020
the right thing to do. Right.

764
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,440
Regardless of penalty or fear.

765
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,780
OK, so the voice thing is is one thing.

766
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,420
And I showed the various ways I kind of jumbled it up going off on tangents, but it

767
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,560
changed the beings that give you the voice.

768
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,220
Yeah. I keep saying the voice.

769
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,060
I'm sounding like Frank Herbert and doing because the Bene Gesserit have something

770
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,600
called the voice that you can manipulate other people with.

771
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Right. Make them do things. Right.

772
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,880
Right. So the Frank Herbert doing files would know.

773
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:32,000
OK, so doing an examination of this, are they benevolent or malevolent?

774
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,900
They're neither and they're both.

775
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,080
So that's again, it depends on you.

776
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,380
They're not here so much.

777
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,340
They can be teachers.

778
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,940
They can help you and they can also be malevolent and they can harm you.

779
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,700
Right. But that depends on you again.

780
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,360
In other words, the element of choice is open.

781
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,980
The decisions are up to you.

782
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,580
There's many choices.

783
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,260
Well, you could get used as a weapon against others, too, couldn't you be?

784
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,800
I mean, you could sort of be weaponized.

785
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,220
Let's encourage this one to go ahead and cause problems.

786
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,380
Let's do an advanced tidbit here.

787
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,440
When we talk about the emo work, yes, that's silent.

788
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,600
And what have I spoken about?

789
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,400
Your true voice, your true method of communication is silent.

790
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,040
When you do the emo work to influence someone,

791
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,140
that is far more powerful than having them hear voices in their head.

792
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,300
Because when you do the emo work on someone good or bad,

793
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,700
what people think, right,

794
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,960
as good or good or bad, that goes right to the core spirit part.

795
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,800
And that's far more powerful than putting a voice in their head.

796
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,220
So let me give you an example.

797
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,880
Right now, most people that are subs and listening,

798
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
I consider to be fairly intelligent.

799
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,040
And you and I might be fairly intelligent right now.

800
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,000
If some gray van drove by with a little satellite dish on it

801
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,740
and beamed some kind of energy weapon and you heard a voice in your head right now,

802
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,920
you'd be more startled and humored or scared than saying that's really my voice.

803
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,080
You'd recognize it, right?

804
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,980
Someone beamed a voice into your head, you know, voice to skull technology, right?

805
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,060
Right. All of a sudden you have a disembodied voice.

806
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,620
It's like, wait a minute. Is that a ghost? Is that a technology?

807
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,340
What is that? You're not going to eat that.

808
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,840
You're not going to say, oh, I just have to do this because I just heard it in my head.

809
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,820
You're not going to follow that.

810
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,280
You're not going to answer it directly.

811
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
No, you're not going to answer.

812
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,300
You're going to say, I just had this anomalous thing.

813
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,420
I heard myself, you know, tell myself to go, you know, get a

814
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,880
kitchen fork and stab the dog. I'm not going to do that.

815
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,020
My first question is, where the hell did that come from?

816
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,760
I'd be trying to track down where it came from.

817
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,920
It'd be more of a distraction.

818
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,800
But for some people, it's not right for some people that are not aware of this.

819
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,300
So anything audible in your head or in that degree.

820
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,000
Again, the silent you're feeling.

821
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,980
So, OK, see the silent voice that is you is communicated through feelings.

822
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,540
But when I say feeling, it's feeling like a machinist has what's called a feeler gauge.

823
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,840
Right. OK, look up what a feeler gauge is in machining to get ultra

824
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,380
very, very precise spacing.

825
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,140
It's more like that.

826
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,880
It's a non audible, non literal, non.

827
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,160
Well, anything that uses words or language.

828
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,800
It's a non language, but it has a language of its own.

829
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,180
Just like when I speak on the emo work, you know, when you feel

830
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,320
when you give someone a hug, there's a certain feeling you have that has.

831
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,000
That's a word.

832
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,540
Imagine that feeling is a category in itself.

833
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
When you're angry, you have a certain feeling when you're hungry, right?

834
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,960
Hungry or desire.

835
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,500
You have a certain feeling when you're jealous.

836
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,440
That's always feelings and emotions have their own language as well.

837
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,680
But they're not in words.

838
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,860
How many times you even heard?

839
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,680
I can't put it in words, but I feel it.

840
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,540
Right. Of course.

841
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,560
Yeah, that's the basis of it.

842
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,300
Right. Again, the poor old sap out in the field gets picked up by a UFO,

843
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,040
taken to an advanced, sterile planet.

844
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,620
One of the things that one of the features is that they're telepathic.

845
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,060
Right. Usually in Hollywood.

846
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,780
Right. They're trying to show you all these different ways that things can exist.

847
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:03,000
So essentially, it's the evil is really the highest level because that's the silent level.

848
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,440
But it's yet very dynamic.

849
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,580
You see?

850
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,660
Now, I'm not saying that that voice will ever go away,

851
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,060
but I'm saying I gave you the gradations that I've discovered as it moves on and on.

852
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,160
Now, I think I got to the advanced part.

853
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,960
If you're a more advanced person, you know, culturally,

854
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,300
spiritually, intellectually, academically, whatever,

855
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,620
they switch up to a more advanced voice to keep up with you.

856
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,520
But when you keep advancing, it's more rarefied.

857
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,400
And they have some rare beings on their side to give you a voice.

858
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,420
But to stay ahead of you, because they know you're a type of person that's always advancing.

859
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:39,900
Right.

860
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,300
They start anticipating giving you the future.

861
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,020
So you have some people that this happens to.

862
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,440
And guess what?

863
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,240
They call themselves psychics.

864
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,340
I'm psychic.

865
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,980
No, you're not.

866
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,340
You don't have any more psychic ability than anybody else does.

867
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,840
But yes, the reason why, because you have been anticipated to be given this.

868
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,380
Right.

869
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,640
Trait.

870
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,580
It's another being.

871
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,640
I know this is kind of harsh to say it this way.

872
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,040
Yeah.

873
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,240
So we all have the same abilities to a certain degree.

874
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,720
You know, there are some people that could jump higher, run faster, think faster,

875
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,340
count numbers faster.

876
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,060
Yeah, there's natural degrees and variations in talent.

877
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,860
But generally, everybody, you know, can do almost the same thing.

878
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,260
So when you see someone who's like a real psychic, not the fake ones, let's say, or

879
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,180
the ones that say they're not.

880
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,980
There's a video that I like in French, where a guy sitting on a train and he greets someone.

881
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,220
He says, I was looking for you.

882
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,300
They say, you're a psychic.

883
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,720
Are you a psychic?

884
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,320
He says, yes.

885
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,920
And then he slaps him across the face.

886
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,060
And he says, oh, you're a charlatan, a fake, because if you were really psychic, you knew

887
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,500
I was going to slap you across the face.

888
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,680
Right.

889
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,640
So.

890
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,580
So, OK, so, yeah, there's that aspect as well.

891
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,280
It's kind of harsh.

892
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,280
So when you get to a certain level, they will start giving you anomalous paranormal stuff

893
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,360
to chew on because they're anticipating that you're going to keep growing and they're like

894
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:58,760
running out.

895
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,560
They don't want to spend so much energy on you.

896
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,840
So they mess with you.

897
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,300
Right.

898
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,080
They're giving you like they show you things of what you're going to see and hear today.

899
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,760
And you're like, you just take that in stride.

900
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:08,980
Right.

901
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,800
So that's where they can help.

902
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,580
That could be helpful.

903
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,940
It could be hindrance.

904
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,560
A lot of the people that are locked up because they can't manage this, believe it or not,

905
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,300
there's a guy, Jerry, whatever.

906
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,420
Oh, my gosh.

907
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,920
I should know.

908
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,780
He's actually a Tucsonan.

909
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,060
Well, let's get to bed.

910
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,880
Something like that.

911
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,600
He used to work in the psychological field, psychiatry, treating criminals, criminals

912
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,860
in psych wards.

913
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,240
And he said, yeah, there's a voice in my head and it tells me what to do.

914
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,740
So it would get to the point where it tells me when to break into a house, which room

915
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,560
and which drawer and the combination in the safe and open it and I'd get all the stuff

916
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,020
and leave.

917
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,980
And if the police would show up, the voice would tell me, hide right here from count

918
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,000
to five and then run to the next spot, count to 10 and then run.

919
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,820
And he would get away.

920
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:03,380
So it was like this other entity that was able to see, you know, a nonphysical entity

921
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,880
into other people's homes.

922
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,880
Right, right.

923
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,120
And even like once I was with the wife and we had some valuables in the in the car, let's

924
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,400
say.

925
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,680
And I said, it doesn't matter where you hide it in the car, because if you have one of

926
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,140
these thieves, like the Jerry Walensky guy talks about, that is guided by one of these

927
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,740
other guys that are nonphysical.

928
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,100
No matter where you hide it in the car, the other entity knows where it is.

929
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,480
He's going to tell him when to break the window, how to reach in and where it is hidden

930
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,020
exactly.

931
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,140
Right, right.

932
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,940
So and the reason these guys got caught is because the voices made them crazy.

933
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,380
So it's like, you know, there'll be three in the morning.

934
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,920
They jump in a cold shower and run out in the street naked.

935
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,640
And the neighbors are like, what the hell are you doing?

936
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,420
Call the cops.

937
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,420
That's how it gets caught.

938
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,580
Not because not because he got caught.

939
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,400
You see what I mean?

940
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,340
Right, right.

941
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,660
Well, look, a specific question then.

942
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,020
Look, you had an instance here where you knew something ahead of me telling you about it.

943
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,400
Were you told that by another entity, another voice?

944
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:58,860
Of course.

945
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,640
Of course.

946
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,340
I'm not psychic.

947
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,880
OK, I just figured I'd ask because.

948
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,280
With me for a long time, since I was 12, giving me stuff that's going to happen.

949
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,860
So but hey, you know, this is planet Earth.

950
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,080
You know, this is like the whole thing.

951
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,620
You know, when I start Greek speak out in the public, let's say at the shops, at a grocery

952
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,000
store, I start talking about it.

953
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,720
But after five minutes or so, I get a crowd of people.

954
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,820
Someone in there says, hey, you should write a book.

955
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

956
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,400
You know, and I'm like, listen, all the stuff I'm talking about, you know, if you've been

957
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,120
on this planet for more than 15 minutes, you should know this.

958
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,820
They're like, oh, well, I asked him, have you been on this planet for more than an hour?

959
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,760
And they're like, yeah.

960
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,200
And I'm like, and you don't know this.

961
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,780
And they're like, huh?

962
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,280
You see, it's the same thing.

963
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,400
It's the same thing.

964
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,200
It's no big deal.

965
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,580
You know, just because you hear things you haven't heard before doesn't mean you're special

966
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,920
or whatever.

967
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,200
You're just mixed in here.

968
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,420
So here's the thing.

969
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,500
Have you been on this planet more than an hour?

970
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,740
So you should have figured it out.

971
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,040
And what?

972
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,760
OK, what do you mean, figure out the whole planet in an hour?

973
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,060
Yeah.

974
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,200
OK, so when you walk, you got to go to the bathroom and you're a guy, you walk into the

975
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,700
girl's bathroom.

976
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,180
How long does it take you to figure out you're in a girl's bathroom?

977
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Or OK, here you park the car, you go out, you go into a dive bar.

978
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,020
How long does it take you to figure out you just walked into a dive bar, right?

979
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,540
Like, what, 30 seconds, a minute?

980
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,960
This is a dive bar.

981
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,080
Not long.

982
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,200
You can figure it out.

983
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,400
Yeah, you're pretty quick.

984
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:22,900
Yeah.

985
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,640
So what I'm saying is you walk into things that you were told or thought you should go

986
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,900
into and they end up being not what you thought they were.

987
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,520
That's what I mean about figuring it out.

988
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:33,880
Right.

989
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,400
You notice it's like the same with the bathroom.

990
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:36,760
You know that.

991
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,540
Oh, wait a second.

992
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,940
I think this is the girl's bathroom.

993
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,820
You know, what's what's your first clue?

994
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,340
Because everything in here you have to do sitting down, right?

995
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,220
No urinals.

996
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,400
Yeah, that's what years ago you say.

997
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,120
It's a man's world.

998
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:49,800
It's a bullshit.

999
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,940
All these houses that are being built.

1000
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Forget about the regular homes, ticky tacky houses and all that go up to where the rich

1001
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,560
people live.

1002
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,040
I want you to get a tour of 10 houses and tell me what you don't see.

1003
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,560
I don't know what you mean, Greek.

1004
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,460
You got all these expensive houses.

1005
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,720
You don't see a urinal.

1006
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,740
So how is it a man's world if they're not putting urinals and bathrooms in people's

1007
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,080
houses?

1008
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,340
How is it a man's world?

1009
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,180
How have you ever seen a urinal in a man in a house before?

1010
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,020
I've never seen it.

1011
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,640
Only the ones that I put in.

1012
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:24,520
I have only ever seen that in places that are meant for public people to keep coming in

1013
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,100
and out of where there's masses.

1014
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,260
But it's a man's world, but they're not accommodating the man's world.

1015
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,260
Not at home.

1016
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,900
You see, this is a big deal to me, right?

1017
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,280
Because look, I'll get a little personal.

1018
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,060
Sure.

1019
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,160
I was bike racing for a long time and you sit on the thing sometimes and it goes numb.

1020
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,480
And after a while, I started realizing I can't pee straight.

1021
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,740
I can't be straight.

1022
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,280
I can't.

1023
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:47,960
You know what I mean?

1024
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,100
It pees like that.

1025
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,680
You know, when you go to the irrigation department in the hardware store, get different

1026
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,200
sprinklers that have different fan patterns.

1027
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,540
Anyway, I'm not going to get into it.

1028
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,240
But you see what I mean, right?

1029
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,660
If I need a urinal.

1030
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,400
If you pinch off a hose long enough, it stops letting the flow go.

1031
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,240
Yeah, I get you.

1032
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,600
Okay.

1033
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,480
Or when it comes out, the flow is like one of those 15 degree sprinkler heads, right?

1034
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:08,860
Yeah.

1035
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,460
So yeah.

1036
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,500
So anyway, the reason I'm saying this is because for some, for me, it's exaggerated.

1037
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,380
But I've been exaggerating this point for 30 years now.

1038
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,720
How is it a man's world?

1039
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,520
They don't say that anymore.

1040
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,020
But when they said it more, you know, like in the 80s, they used to say that more, right?

1041
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,640
I mean, how is it a man's world?

1042
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,900
I've never been in even a mansion or a wealthy person's home that has a urinal.

1043
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,340
They're making everybody sit down or stand up and make sure that, you know, there's an

1044
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,920
imaginary target in the toilet.

1045
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,440
You got to, you know, you can't drift, right?

1046
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,200
You can't read the newspaper or something, right?

1047
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,920
You know, while you're, you know, anyway.

1048
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,180
This is the point.

1049
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,620
These things are obvious, what I'm saying.

1050
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,740
But it's not a matter of knowing about everything.

1051
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,820
It's like, what do you know quickly, right?

1052
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,540
Like, this is a bar.

1053
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,300
Let's go to the bar.

1054
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,080
When you walk in, you think it's, you know, a bar, you know, should be a bar, you know,

1055
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,240
place you go to enjoy yourself.

1056
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,160
But it's a dive bar.

1057
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,700
It stinks.

1058
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,740
And it's right.

1059
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,320
So you're like, wait a second.

1060
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,260
Hold on.

1061
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,580
The same thing.

1062
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,800
When you are given all these premises and things in life, not only do you have the inner

1063
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,120
voice, which you think is you, which is not you.

1064
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,500
You have all of these things around you, which not are not what they should be or you're told

1065
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,940
they are and no one cares.
