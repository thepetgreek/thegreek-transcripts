1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,680
51, this Sonic event, pattern break, there you go, anyway, I got a couple of things on

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,600
my mind, I might kick it off and I'm not even going to ask the Greek how he's doing.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,360
So how's that for a break in the pattern?

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, well, what's doing is, you know, people thought 33 was the Freemason number, it's

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
really 51 that they used to communicate a lot.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,400
They use the 33, like there's 33 million people positive for COVID, you're going to

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,260
start seeing the 51 and the 15.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,860
So it could be 1.5 billion 5.1 million 50, you're right, you see what I mean?

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,860
Just the five and the one in days and in numbers, quantities or whatever.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,320
That's their signaling.

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,860
Yeah, they're pathetic, by the way, they don't do this too much.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeah.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,920
They also use 15 days as a count quite often.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,280
By the way, I've noticed that often where it's a little more than two weeks, so it

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400
doesn't give you the two weeks according to your calendar.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,140
And you got the 15 days, which is interesting because they don't count the days properly

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,760
anyway.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,880
But, you know, but they're 15 days, but always the one in the five.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,320
You're right.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,560
That is interesting.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,080
Well, well, look at the past few years, the stuff that's in the news.

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,520
Johnny Depp, 15 million dollar lawsuit, right?

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,200
This goes across Hollywood, medical, financial, everything.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,020
That's the way they signal to each other, meaning that we got to.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,980
The reason I said they're so pathetic is because, you know, people refer to them as the elite

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
and they have all these fancy cars and mansions and whatever.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,040
They're actually trapped.

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,820
They have nothing.

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,660
They are intermediates between those who rule the surface and the surface inhabitants.

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,240
That's one thing like the Musk and the Jeff Bozo and Bill Gates.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,220
Those people are completely enslaved.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,780
They have nothing at all, no freedom at all and no character to speak with.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,600
You know, like like a Russian Dimitri, he basically says, you go down to the, you know, the bad

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,479
part of town and you meet some gangster.

36
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,040
He's got more charisma and character than any of these people that they're showing you

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,740
as being elite.

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,420
Right.

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:13,900
True.

40
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:14,760
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,840
So, yeah, they're pretty pathetic.

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,060
And I have a second hand knowledge on how pathetic they are and some first hand knowledge.

43
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,400
So when they're called the elite, it's because they're the ones that it's kind of like the

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
hot sheets.

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,260
You watch what they're saying.

46
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,100
But the people really have the people have the because they're messaging, they're not

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,640
doing anything.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,220
When you when you said hot sheets, I thought of the Inquirer and stuff in the movie.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,560
Yeah.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,920
That's exactly what they are.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,880
They are just the hot sheets.

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,640
In other words, they're what and the people themselves lack so much.

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,920
But anyway, the bottom line is this, that if you let me just fast forward to the point

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,680
like the money system, the medical system, if enough people wake up, you know, you get

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,100
nuked.

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,420
Right.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,980
So let's say a bunch of Americans say we want lawful money.

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,780
This is bankrupt.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,660
This is fraud.

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,140
They'll nuke you.

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,240
In other words, they'll use your own nukes on you.

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Right.

64
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,060
Just like.

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,320
Right.

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,280
It's very simple.

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,440
That's always when a mass murder occurs is right at the time that people start to go.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:14,820
Wait a minute.

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,200
I think we're getting the idea of what's actually happening here.

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
And then a mass murder occurs.

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
And I don't mean these little ones that are only, you know, a couple dozen people get

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,600
shot at a Walmart.

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,180
I'm talking.

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,360
You mean like a Civil War revolution type thing?

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,740
Yes.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,180
That's when they try to clear the slate and go, hey, turn on each other and shoot each

77
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,080
other for a little while.

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:30,940
Oh, yeah.

79
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,460
No, I mean, like what they'll do is they'll divide the military.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
They'll find out.

81
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,940
Right.

82
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,860
They need a small percentage because mechanized.

83
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,580
You don't need one person can operate a device that could kill 20,000 people or more.

84
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,320
They'll just find out who will do anything for money, you know, and, you know, they just

85
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,100
print money.

86
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,320
Right.

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,560
And they the military, all this crap about their, you know, humans are morons in military

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
or are weaponized morons.

89
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,920
Right.

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,820
So you never thank anyone for being in the service, because when they're talking about

91
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,160
the enemy, they're talking about the civilian population.

92
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,440
So people don't know this.

93
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,160
This is a fact, by the way, what I'm saying, and it's the truth.

94
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
Stick to the facts.

95
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,500
Now, the truth is way beyond what most people will ever comprehend.

96
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,300
But what what they do very simply is get a few desperate people or, you know, really

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,399
greedy, which is easy, which is most of the people.

98
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,920
And you just unleash them on the rest.

99
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,660
It's very simple.

100
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:24,980
Right.

101
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,500
We haven't seen that type of self-destruction on a society yet.

102
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
I don't think it's going to happen here, but it's all set up for it.

103
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,620
Right.

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,700
Yeah.

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,160
Look, all that stuff is definitely set in place.

106
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,340
And one of the weird things that did come up in the chat, and I don't want to turn to

107
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,780
the chat too much this time, but I did think about it a little bit because somebody asked,

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,540
you know, about crop circles and this and that.

109
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,800
And alien presentation is one of those interesting topics where I think a lot of people are right

110
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,280
and wrong about it all the time, because I don't think they recognize what type of entities

111
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,780
are interacting on this planet already all the time that are in a way alien to us.

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,300
But they're not really aliens.

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,520
Yeah.

114
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,700
They've been here all along.

115
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,100
No, they're alien, but they're coming from different places.

116
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,720
They're coming from a reality that we don't see.

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,080
They're coming from the underground and they're coming from above.

118
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,600
Greek speak is alien to an academic, right?

119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:17,960
Yeah.

120
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,580
But after you live somewhere long enough, after you work somewhere long enough, I mean,

121
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,500
you become a resident.

122
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,040
You become part of it because you're immersed in it.

123
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,860
I mean, so how long is it that, you know, these entities got to be here interacting and doing

124
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,060
things before you got to say, look, this is kind of their home, too.

125
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,320
Because they don't want the entities, though, because the entities are going to wake people

126
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,160
up and say, hey, you've been frauded in the most.

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,400
So in other words, they're using like low grade fraud scenarios on you, low grade pranks.

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,720
And you guys don't even see it.

129
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,580
You know, like the financial system is a low grade prank.

130
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,080
The medical system is a low grade prank, like stuff third graders do.

131
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Right. Well, yeah. If you're going to keep laughing at the whoopee cushion, why get into

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
the, you know, extemporaneous humor of somebody who's going through it?

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,180
Well, you don't need it because.

134
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
Well, yeah. Well, here's another way to say it.

135
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,500
Like someone who could be easily controlled, ain't worth controlling someone who could

136
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,780
be easily manipulated, ain't worth manipulating.

137
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
In other words, you ain't got much.

138
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,200
That's not much of a person.

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,960
Right. Go ahead and manipulate someone with strong character.

140
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,540
See what to see what happens.

141
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,820
Well, boy, that's not. So in other words, the population at large across the world.

142
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,180
So I used to think it was Americans.

143
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,200
Right. See, and the only place I ever hear people say like this outside of you, the only

144
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,060
place I've ever heard people speak like this is among the gangster population, because

145
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,720
this is exactly what they say.

146
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,900
Look, I don't care about controlling this guy, that guy.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
I don't care about any of that. That's nothing.

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,220
That's easy. You know, you want it.

149
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,420
You want to make something really happen.

150
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,300
Here's who you get to get a hold of.

151
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,060
You know what I mean? So someone like the mass, the mass population is easy to control.

152
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,760
They're not worth anything. You know what I mean?

153
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,080
It's just the puppets, right?

154
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,960
No, you know, something.

155
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,820
But it's changing your pocket as opposed to actual power.

156
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,880
Well, that's what I say about suckers.

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,340
Someone says, well, you know, I'm going to do business with him or so and so because

158
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,560
they're a sucker. And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

159
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,520
You got it wrong. If they're already established as being a sucker, see, they're going to

160
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,600
lose their money anyway.

161
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,140
So you better do business with them because they'd rather fall in your wallet than

162
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,100
someone. It's kind of they're going to lose their money regardless.

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,540
So wouldn't you rather have their lose their money with you?

164
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,100
There's some other guys that you're never going to meet.

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,820
That's going to work with you. It's like, oh, I never thought of it that way.

166
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,060
I said, ah, now you're starting to think, listen, if there's gold bars laying in the

167
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,240
street, you might as well pick them up because somebody else will.

168
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,880
If you don't, I mean, actually, there might be some times you don't want to pick them

169
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,640
up, but that's another story.

170
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,860
OK, yeah, especially if they're American, because they're probably tungsten inside.

171
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,480
Right. See, now there's trouble.

172
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,580
Yeah, I thought, well, by the way, I thought the Americans were really pathetic.

173
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,220
Right. But then I started meeting people and traveling, not that much travel, but

174
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,420
meeting people from all over the world, like like 130 different countries.

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,380
I've got catalogs like, where are you from?

176
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,680
Yemen? Where are you from?

177
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,400
Bangladesh. Where are you from?

178
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,140
Here. I was like, oh, my gosh, I've met people in over 100 different countries, you

179
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,940
know, and, you know, amazing how many countries are on the continent and they're all

180
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,100
pretty much the same.

181
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,340
There's a slight flavor variation like Baskin Robbins.

182
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,080
You know, you're getting ice cream, you know, you're getting sugar, you know, you're

183
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,900
getting, you know, dairy and you're right and you're getting the same logo.

184
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,700
That's the same with people. You got 31 flavors, 170 flavors, 200 flavors, but it's

185
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,620
the same stuff.

186
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,539
So then I retracted my way of my approach because it was get out of America time.

187
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,220
Right. This is a while back.

188
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,760
And and it's like it doesn't matter where you go.

189
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,640
It's just a variety of this stupidity and they don't have to be that way.

190
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,080
That's the crazy thing about it.

191
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,200
Speaking of things that don't have to be that way, I want to just segue into the

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,440
weather. Yeah, absolutely.

193
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,860
One of my uncles once told me the only difference about people around the world is

194
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,080
really the way they make their bread.

195
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,300
That's about it. Yeah, very much.

196
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,700
And sandwiches are what they call a sandwich, which is what you put in the bread.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah. So, you know, and that that is funny to me.

198
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,360
But OK, yeah, let's let's move on to the weather, because that is an interesting

199
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,520
topic in and of itself.

200
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,400
It's constantly used to engage people in fear porn, you know.

201
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,440
Now, watch the weather. Watch the weather.

202
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm always what I saw this big time.

203
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,900
They're pushing this thing called Hurricane Lee.

204
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,180
It's let's give a time mark.

205
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,680
Well, it's about the 10th day of the seventh month.

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
Hmm. Right.

207
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah. And so well, according to the Pope's according to the Pope's work schedule,

208
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,640
that's almost accurate because, yeah, it's it's a day of atonement kind of thing.

209
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:44,020
Right. OK, so so anyway, just to give a time marker would be the ninth of September

210
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,240
to twenty three.

211
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,640
Right. Two thousand twenty three.

212
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,380
Yeah. So someone said, listen, can you do something about this?

213
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,440
And I'm like, what's this?

214
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,460
Hurricane Lee. I said, look at it.

215
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,600
And by the way, this is a funded project, by the way.

216
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,060
And so that got me, you know, when someone wants to separate themselves from their

217
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,200
funds to do something on weather, I'm all for it because I like to do the weather

218
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,240
anyway. But one of the reasons I don't do it is because I don't get anything for it.

219
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
Right. And it takes a lot of time.

220
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,980
So I looked at it and I said, wait a second.

221
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,540
This thing is kind of minor.

222
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,260
It's got everything going right.

223
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,800
And it's being pushed in the media like they have it prescripted.

224
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,580
Right. You know what I mean?

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
So this is pretty you can.

226
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,660
Well, I don't watch the media a lot, but I could tell when they're reading.

227
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,820
Well, they're always reading a script.

228
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,180
But this is really, really strong on the prescriptive thing.

229
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Right. And I'm like, why are they prescriptive?

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,080
And then I'm watching it. I'm watching it goes from a minor storm to a category five

231
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,140
in like 16 hours.

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,180
Right. And I'm like, that never happens.

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,260
It never happened in history.

234
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,040
And I'm like, OK, let's go for it.

235
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,640
Well, wait, pause right there, because how ridiculous is that in reality?

236
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,540
Because the way I understand it is it takes, you know, like a full day for a full

237
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,980
category, according to their measurements, three, you never get more than one

238
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,880
category change in less than a day or two or a day and a half minimum.

239
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
That's what I was trying to say.

240
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,660
OK, yeah. So I am right.

241
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,220
This one this one from below one or one is storm five in a little bit over 12

242
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,220
hours. I mean, that's literally like tropical storm to seriously dangerous hurricane in

243
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,860
24 hours, which is like not that's unprecedented, basically.

244
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,460
Well, this would have been an unprecedented above like the French category, meaning

245
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,840
higher than any category.

246
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,920
This is would have been another Katrina or Sandy.

247
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,020
OK, right. This was as I see it.

248
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,040
And I saw it in the media.

249
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,480
What's the way they were portraying it?

250
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,080
You know, the way they portray 9-11 COVID, they were doing the same emo behind it.

251
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,140
Superstorm, super event, you know, a bunch of things all coming in and make sure to

252
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,160
interrupt other stories to push it.

253
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,420
Right. Right. So I was looking at this.

254
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,040
I was like, oh, they're using the formula, which is like DEF CON, you know, whatever.

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't know. The higher number is more dangerous for the lower number.

256
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,160
I don't know. Whatever. But anyway, they were pushing the DEF CON thing, you know.

257
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,600
So this is yeah.

258
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,200
So this is the high speed boogeyman, not like the one that's meant to simmer there for a

259
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,400
long time, like this is high speed and high speed.

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,640
So when it does a lot of damage, they're like, we told you so before.

261
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,100
Of course. Well, that adds to their credibility so that next time they want to cause an

262
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,500
alarm, they can, regardless of whether it's legitimate or not.

263
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,440
So, yeah, OK, gotcha.

264
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,080
OK, let's go back to some vintage cartoons, which still exist today.

265
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
It's called Spy vs.

266
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,540
Spy. You remember that?

267
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,020
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

268
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,360
OK, anybody look that up.

269
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,880
Spy vs.

270
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,220
Spy. This is what's going on.

271
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,860
Mad Magazine, Black vs.

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,060
White Guide, a whole thing.

273
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,580
There's actually they made video games out of it, all kinds of stuff.

274
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah, go ahead. OK, so still, yeah, it's still extant, you know, because I thought

275
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,340
I remember having Mad Magazines from the 50s, actually the 60s and 70s.

276
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,500
They always had a section for Spy vs.

277
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,240
Spy, right?

278
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,500
It's 80s also.

279
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,460
I don't know.

280
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,880
So it's extant, it kept going.

281
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
It didn't fade out. Yeah.

282
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Interesting. OK, so this is Spy.

283
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,000
So what happens is I take out some devices that I know work really well, years of

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,760
experience, two decades of experience now, actually three decades of experience.

285
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,140
And I said, what is the most, you know, Occam's razor?

286
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,120
You know, what is the most minimalist thing?

287
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,460
Sometimes that works the best, right?

288
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,520
What is the what is the simplest explanation that usually explains a lot of the

289
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,140
complexity? Yeah, I got you.

290
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,300
OK, so I went after two ways.

291
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,760
I said one thing is affect the environment, affect the storm, do both.

292
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,080
Don't just go after the storm.

293
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,140
So what I noticed after about eight hours of starting the op with two devices, very

294
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,860
crude devices, but they're very technical also, meaning that the proportions and all

295
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,740
that. And so what I did was I noticed that when I first approached the project, it

296
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,560
had two counter rotating arms that had the classic hurricane.

297
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,860
You know, the international symbol for hurricane is the two rotate counter rotating

298
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,900
arms with the center, right?

299
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,000
I right. Well, as soon as I started, I noticed that within five or six hours, one

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,060
of the arms disappeared, the one that faces west.

301
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,880
So I got rid of one of the arms.

302
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,980
And if you get rid of one of the arms, it's not a hurricane anymore.

303
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,220
Right. Well, it can't spin.

304
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,040
It needs both.

305
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,020
Yeah, wobbles along.

306
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,600
It's kind of like a wheel with a flat side on it.

307
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,300
Right. Exactly. You can see it on the thing.

308
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,680
So I took one of the arms out in less than a day.

309
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,720
I was like, oh, my gosh, this thing is really subject to it.

310
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,540
So this thing was artificially started.

311
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,720
And so I knocked it down and then it went up to a five.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,300
Well, while I was doing this, it was it was it had already become a five.

313
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,240
And I knocked one of the arms off.

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,420
OK, so just for clarification, were they predicting it was going to be a five or did they

315
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,060
already say it was a five before?

316
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,220
Well, this thing is this thing is propagated, if you know what I mean.

317
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,360
No, no, I understand that. But what I'm saying is they're reporting.

318
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,200
Were they saying it's going to be a five or a five already?

319
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,380
Well, no, no. They just said Tropical Storm went from category two to a five in real

320
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,600
time. OK, fair enough.

321
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,220
So but you could see it was all very much like, you know, you better read this right

322
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,900
now, you know. So, yeah, it's just like the 9-11 or, you know, the typical fear stuff.

323
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,140
Right. Right. Right. OK.

324
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,720
So it took the I said, OK, I've got resonance with it.

325
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,620
And then after about 18 hours, I saw that it went totally flat to the side that I was

326
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
affecting completely flat.

327
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,100
I look like a dumpling, you know, a dumpling lays flat on the plate and it's round on

328
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,700
top of this thing, a dumpling turned sideways.

329
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,620
So I'm like, wow, I really got resonance with it.

330
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,980
And then they started pumping it again.

331
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,520
The altitude went up very, very high.

332
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,300
In other words, instead of it being at a moderate altitude, it went way up because it

333
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,680
couldn't it doesn't want to move into the zone that I put in front of it.

334
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,000
And they kept pumping it and pumping it and pumping it.

335
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,500
And one of the side effects of very strong weather ops, whether I'm doing it or

336
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,440
others are doing it, is makes the ground shake.

337
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,320
OK, so then Morocco hit what I was doing, caused about seven tremors in Puerto Rico

338
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,980
because I predicted I sent a message is going to be tremors along the line from

339
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,460
Tucson, Georgia, northern Florida, Cuba, Puerto Rico.

340
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,900
Look along that line.

341
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,560
Right. OK, so that means the center of the shaking event is somewhere in the ocean and

342
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,580
it's causing tremors in Puerto Rico.

343
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,000
Is that right? No. And what causes tremors is the where it hits the ground, where it

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,960
concentrates. So the tremors that were created because of the op I was doing were

345
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,820
happening in Puerto Rico because that was right that's in front of the hurricane.

346
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,800
That's why it has never stopped.

347
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,520
But what they were doing there at the center of energy was affected Morocco going

348
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,560
through the ground. So these guys are hitting this from Europe.

349
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,580
In other words, whatever they're doing, the main point of influence is east, not

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,260
west. So which is five versus five.

351
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,400
Again, the black, right, the black and white, the white guys on the west, the black

352
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,680
guys on the east, whatever, whatever.

353
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,660
Right. So I call it spy and spy because when the Morocco earthquake happened, it gave

354
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,980
up. It gave up where they're producing their influence from.

355
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,620
Right. By the way, this is I'm serious as a heart attack on this.

356
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,260
And I could back up everything I'm saying.

357
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,880
If you can go more and more and why the earthquakes happen.

358
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,079
It's not necessary. I did predict earthquakes along the line from Tucson all the way

359
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,900
to Puerto Rico. And there were seven tremors in Puerto Rico after I predicted that.

360
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,180
Right. OK, there's an earthquake map, by the way, live gives you up to the minute,

361
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,859
supposedly earthquake with a map.

362
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,640
So so everything's working fine.

363
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,339
But they made the big one in Morocco.

364
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,520
So what does that mean? Now, they really they saw the thing go down and they're

365
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,220
like, oh, what happened? Let's boost it up.

366
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,420
They know what they know. I'm doing it.

367
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,000
And all communications are being monitored.

368
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,920
So it's spy versus spy.

369
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,420
Well, what is the spy versus spy?

370
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,300
Like they go shake hands and each one's got like a bomb behind his back.

371
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,700
Right. Right.

372
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,840
You know, or something. And it usually doesn't end up well for one of them in each

373
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
in each skit. Right.

374
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,680
But they come back every year.

375
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,040
That's why I would run on mad TV every week.

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,500
Also, you know, which was like, yeah, they did that, too, where there would be like,

377
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,840
you know, a two minute thing where just really quickly what happened.

378
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,120
They would throw a bomb at each other over a wall blindly, whatever.

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
And yeah, one guy gets got.

380
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,600
The other guy laughs and then they start again next week.

381
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,300
And then next week, the other guy wins. Right.

382
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,800
Right. Yeah. So this is very, very interesting.

383
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,120
And I'm watching this and I'm still influencing it now for the past 24 hours.

384
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,380
It's moved like 10 miles, which it should have moved a couple of hundred.

385
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,420
The big hurricane. So it's stuck there.

386
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,200
It's it's well, everything in nature has to move, you know, like a shark.

387
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,120
If it doesn't move, it, you know, can't live.

388
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,640
Right. It needs for. So it's bobbing up and down.

389
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,660
You could look at it on the satellite maps.

390
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,100
They don't know what to say about it.

391
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,360
They don't know the track.

392
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,600
But my goal is to have it completely gone by what they call Monday,

393
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,740
completely fizzled off, not going up through Atlantic

394
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,620
and making storms in Boston or Canada or wherever.

395
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,820
No, it'll be gone, gone, gone.

396
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,260
I once did a very, very intense abatement of a hurricane

397
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,620
that was going to be another kind of sandy thing back into 2014

398
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,100
and in Louisiana.

399
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,620
And I went very, very strong on that.

400
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,220
And it became sunny skies,

401
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,060
but you can still see the eye of the hurricane on the infrared.

402
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,600
So there was not a cloud in the sky,

403
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,400
but they were baffled on why the eye of the hurricane was showing up on infrared.

404
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
But it was totally clear sky, not a cloud, no wind, nothing.

405
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,400
Think about that.

406
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,920
That's you could find that article.

407
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,420
I forgot the the name of the storm around 2014 is supposed to hit New Orleans.

408
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,940
They started evacuating and they're like, what do you mean evacuate?

409
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,680
There's not a cloud in the sky. It's not even windy.

410
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,620
And there's nothing on the weather.

411
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,700
What do you it's all prescripted, right?

412
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, well, so I have evidence of the ethereal effect versus,

413
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,480
you know, what you can see.

414
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
OK, so I figured I'd share this because I know that amongst the listeners

415
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,960
is about half a dozen people that dabble with weather. Right.

416
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,760
So and I don't it's not good to talk about it while you're doing it too much.

417
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,060
And I am talking about it as much as I think is safe at this point,

418
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,520
even though it sounds like I'm being a little whatever, no hubris here.

419
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,320
But these things are this is what I tell people say.

420
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,560
Oh, Greek, you could do the weather.

421
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,460
That's bullshit, because if you could control the weather,

422
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,180
you'd be a billionaire.

423
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,380
And I'm like, what kind of plausible logic is that?

424
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,500
I mean, that means you don't know where you live at all.

425
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,000
Usually I tell people that your your self-esteem is so low

426
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,920
that you never thought you could meet anyone that had those kind of skills.

427
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,280
You should think more of yourself.

428
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,140
Yeah. And who's to say you're not a billionaire anyway?

429
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,060
I don't know. Yeah, I know.

430
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,140
But the thing is ridiculous.

431
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,940
You know, I mean, this is the plausibility of the masses is just absurd.

432
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,720
And even friends and family, by the way, you know, they're part of the group, too.

433
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,920
You know, that's why I always say there's a lot of evil people.

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,620
I go to a regular group of people.

435
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,480
I see there's a lot of evil people in the world right now.

436
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,580
I'll agree. Yeah.

437
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,760
And but it's never their friends and family and they all agree.

438
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,020
It's never anybody they know.

439
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,080
But you just said a lot. There are a lot of them.

440
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,100
So where are the lot of them?

441
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,280
If it's not anyone, you know.

442
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,180
Oh, my gosh. You got to start about reevaluating who you're around. Right.

443
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,960
So where's your evidence for it?

444
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,420
If you're not running into them, where are they?

445
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,400
You know, I can't be your friends or family right now.

446
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,980
Sure. Yeah. Right.

447
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,760
So they can't, you know, just like I think one time we were going to do

448
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,900
an interview with somebody and before we started recording, I said, oh,

449
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,300
she's the kind that you pull the string behind her neck and she talks. Right.

450
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,700
I don't know if you remember that.

451
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,480
I wasn't happy about the right situation.

452
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,380
But in other words, if you want to know what I think about you,

453
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
just listen to what I just said.

454
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,280
So, you know, hidden,

455
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,680
you know, that I don't have, you know, right.

456
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,000
So no, I know you're pretty straight about it.

457
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,640
I mean, you know, I get it. It's it's.

458
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,820
Yeah. So this is what I'm trying to do with the weather here.

459
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,520
That's why, you know, normally I wouldn't go on such a dissertation

460
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,060
on what's going on. But it's funny.

461
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,680
It's funny to watch what they're doing.

462
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,620
You know, I'm using basically like 100 bucks worth of equipment.

463
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,400
They've got about two, 300 million worth of equipment.

464
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,920
They probably have 30 or 40 or 100 people. It's just me.

465
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah. Kind of funny.

466
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,040
Well, it's really funny because, I mean, the stuff that that I have heard

467
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,460
about you working with is hilarious, too, because it doesn't sound

468
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,320
all that expensive to manufacture, even there may be precision involved.

469
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,420
But I mean, it's not like super expensive material.

470
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,860
It's not like you need, you know, diamond studded laser guns or none of that.

471
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,460
OK, I know the stuff, the water devices I make are they're cheap,

472
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,320
but it's it's kind of like Steinmetz and Henry Ford.

473
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,960
Do you know the situation there?

474
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Ford started investing in big AC motors for the factories,

475
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
which makes sense, right? In the 20s. Right.

476
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,180
It's cheaper than right.

477
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,200
Cheaper than horsepower, steam power.

478
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,680
And they kept blowing up because they had certain components in the wrong spot.

479
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,700
So he called Steinmetz to come and show him where they should,

480
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,220
you know, how to rewire it.

481
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,100
And this is the 1920s.

482
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,560
So Steinmetz goes over there, puts a couple of chalk lines

483
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
and some marks on on the thing.

484
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,600
And, you know, it's a motor.

485
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
It's like as tall as you are. Right.

486
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,140
And he sends forward a bill for 10,000 bucks.

487
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,780
And he's like, Ford's like, what?

488
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,160
You're only there for an hour.

489
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,020
And he's like, yeah, well, you let me break down the bill.

490
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,860
It's a dollar for me coming out there and spending an hour.

491
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,700
But nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars

492
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,660
to actually put the chalk mark where it needs to be.

493
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,020
All right.

494
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,040
You get it. Oh, I get it.

495
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,940
So if I'm making a piece of pipe that costs 50 to 100 bucks,

496
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,320
let's say everything, and I'm selling it for five grand, let's say. Right.

497
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,760
It's just a piece of pipe that dirty water goes through and clean water comes out.

498
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,880
You want to do it yourself? Go ahead.

499
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,960
No, it's the Steinmetz thing.

500
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,680
Yeah. So it's actually replacing 15 or 20 thousand dollars worth of equipment,

501
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,620
which which if you so it's cheap, actually, in that perspective.

502
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,240
And that 15 or 20 thousand dollars

503
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,900
worth of equipment needs over a thousand dollars a year.

504
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,960
Maintenance plus personnel.

505
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,760
Oh, yeah. No. And I've had to move those massive

506
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,320
AC units before.

507
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,600
They are taller than me by a couple of feet, actually.

508
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,640
And, you know, it's a couple of us to be able to move them

509
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,400
just to get them out of the way to install institutional windows.

510
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,240
And, whoa, that stuff is heavy and difficult.

511
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,060
And oh, yeah, well, yeah, that depends on what I'm talking about today.

512
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,540
But yeah, it's the whole thing about a hundred years later.

513
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,320
Those things are still huge and ridiculous.

514
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,680
Well, they are. Yeah.

515
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,600
They're not still not building them right because all the technology

516
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,460
that's on the surface is trickled down.

517
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,460
In other words, the society that runs this society is 6000 years ahead.

518
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,900
And over the years, especially the past 200 years,

519
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,140
they decided to trickle down certain science and engineering

520
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,020
that will bring them only 2000 years ahead.

521
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
You get it?

522
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,740
Well, they what they did is they said, look, here's some of the toys.

523
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,540
Yeah. Not the real tools, but have some toys.

524
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
And that's about what they did.

525
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,260
And that's what you do with children.

526
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,760
You give them some toys. It keeps them busy.

527
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,500
So anyway, good.

528
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,780
Yeah, I know.

529
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,060
So, well, it's also that they're keeping a lot of the time

530
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,000
travel, teleportation and the phasers.

531
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
I really want a phaser. Oh, man.

532
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,840
You know where you point it and everything you're pointing,

533
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,580
anything you're pointing out turns to a pile of dust or evaporates completely.

534
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,220
Man, I want a transporter.

535
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,480
And are you kidding me?

536
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,540
Those phasers. Oh, man.

537
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,680
I want both things.

538
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,840
I want to talk about anger management issues.

539
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,240
Anybody's anger management issues will go away if you have one of those.

540
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,180
But anyway, instantly.

541
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,340
Yep. Yeah. Instantly go away.

542
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,520
Trust me.

543
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,500
If you got anger management issues and you got a phaser, those issues disappear.

544
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,800
Anyway. Yeah.

545
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,720
So, yeah. What were we on?

546
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
Technology trickle down. What else is trickling?

547
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,500
Maybe you brought up something in the chat about crop circles.

548
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,740
Let's address that real quick.

549
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,960
Well, crop circles, aliens, other entities coming from elsewhere.

550
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,780
One thing at a time.

551
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,860
Let's be super linear on this, because the alien thing depends on who's

552
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,300
who's using that word.

553
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,480
OK, if you're in the military, anybody that's on the military is alien.

554
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,120
Right. You got enemy alien. Right.

555
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,740
Yeah. True. So. Yeah.

556
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,520
So anyway, crop circles, I came to a conclusion in the 80s

557
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,940
and I'm still sticking by it.

558
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,120
Ninety nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine

559
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,160
percent of all crop circles show up in England.

560
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,860
Right. They try to deflect that fact

561
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,060
by doing a movie with Mel Gibson called Signs.

562
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,980
Remember? Oh, yeah.

563
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,160
He was in the US and they're putting crop circles down all over the world.

564
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,400
They're trying to deflect the nature of it.

565
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,480
Because, you know, it's there's more value in the mystery

566
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,260
if people can't don't figure it out because they figure out there's no mystery.

567
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,260
So if you go back in history, it was the mowing devil.

568
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,560
So it's very simple.

569
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,140
The when these underground critters or people or whatever

570
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,580
bipedals or whatever, tripedals come up from the ground.

571
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,840
They do this as part of their culture.

572
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,020
And they go back underground.

573
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,860
And guess where they are? In England.

574
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,100
In England, these are this is a characteristic of those

575
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,420
that live underneath England or above that.

576
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,180
It's geographic, cultural.

577
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,620
It's, you know, how culture reflects geography and vice versa, right?

578
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,660
So certainly certain certain geography of certain cultures.

579
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,760
That's just the culture of those that are not seen in and around.

580
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,740
It must be. You know how these legal documents

581
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,800
in and around or near and about England.

582
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,360
That's it. That's all it is.

583
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,440
Yes. France included in that as well, because there's a lot of things

584
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,820
about the underground in France.

585
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,800
I mean, the stuff that people everywhere in the entire earth is underground

586
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,000
everywhere. Native Americans will tell you about the ant people right here.

587
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,560
And where I'm at right in the southwest.

588
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,300
Oh, yeah. And everywhere in Russia, they have the abominable snowman

589
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,160
and other creatures.

590
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,120
The elemental. Yeah, right.

591
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
The element is big.

592
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,880
All of the ancient kings got their wealth by dealing with the underground.

593
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,840
You know, when you see those big stones and all that gold that they have,

594
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,200
you know, stones, meaning jewels. Yeah.

595
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,840
Because really, they don't have stones.

596
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,460
If they had stones, they'd still be king.

597
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,540
But hey, jewels and stones can often be interchangeable.

598
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,600
Good. Yeah. Yeah. So there you go.

599
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,540
And yeah, that's they get a lot of stuff.

600
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,940
And in return for the poor peasants, you know,

601
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,460
they're just, you know, who's going to who's going to ask any questions.

602
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,780
It's kind of like the authorities have authority because they have might.

603
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,840
Like, for example, there was a shooting in France.

604
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,340
You mentioned Paris and

605
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,560
a big one, you know, is one of those stage things.

606
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,720
But they did pile up a whole bunch of bodies at the end of it. Right. Yeah.

607
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,820
Well, this has been confirmed from several sources.

608
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,620
And only Damagard mentioned this brought it to my attention.

609
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,180
And I said, this guy sounds like he's hyping it up.

610
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,980
I didn't look into it.

611
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,680
And it was true in terms of what other sources reported.

612
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,220
Make a long story short.

613
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,280
There was a big shooting in Paris about a decade or less.

614
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,960
The bodies piled up.

615
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,160
They didn't mind showing that

616
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,560
a woman exchange student from Mexico City, Mexico.

617
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,780
Her while it was going on, calls her family,

618
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,100
who was very concerned because they knew she was in Paris.

619
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,480
And she said, oh, I'm fine.

620
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,120
I know that all hell's breaking loose, but I'm fine.

621
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,160
I'm at the police station.

622
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,360
Well, guess what?

623
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,940
Two hours later, they find her body and piled up on top of the rest of the bodies.

624
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,480
Uh huh. Well, is that more of a look?

625
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,820
Now we have a good excuse to get rid of the inconvenient whoever.

626
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,320
Or is that, you know,

627
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,020
oh, no. Well, see, the problem with Oleg, I got to tell you, is quite often

628
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,760
I've gone to check some of his so-called facts and he's full of crap.

629
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, yeah. That's that's that's what I'm saying.

630
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
So you got to look to me.

631
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,980
Everything's full of crap until it's not.

632
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,860
It has to be.

633
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,060
No, look, occasionally he's gotten some things right.

634
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,520
But I'm just saying the majority of it.

635
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,520
I go as soon as his name's on it, I go, all right, let me go check.

636
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah, but I looked at this.

637
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
This was quite interesting.

638
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,040
OK, and it disappeared.

639
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,140
You could still probably find some of it.

640
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,580
And this was almost a day after the event I was looking at,

641
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,940
or two days after is one of the things where you got on an interview.

642
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,060
Let's say that week.

643
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,140
So I find it very interesting.

644
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,760
But when I heard that happen, it kind of it's very sad,

645
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,040
but it also made me happy to see that it went public

646
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,800
because I know of these things happening from, you know, past experiences,

647
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,800
hearing things, you know, what the police would do, right?

648
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,200
What? Supposedly. Right.

649
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,340
It's all orchestrated, right?

650
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,740
So, you know, the Martin Luther King.

651
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,580
But again, some people take advantage of things, too, where, look, a riot happens.

652
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,020
So it's a good opportunity to get rid of somebody

653
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,080
and just act like it was part of the riot that took him down. Exactly.

654
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,200
You know, so things like that happen as well.

655
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,200
That's why I asked, was it one of these situations

656
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,820
where they're just getting rid of the inconvenient?

657
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,600
Because that's what they'll do.

658
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,820
You know, in this case, what the feeling anymore that I got from it,

659
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,580
let's say the intuitive feeling is they just needed the body count.

660
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,280
So it's like, hey, you come here.

661
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,180
It's like a Patsy.

662
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,700
Do you think the best Patsy is the one that you haven't dealt with?

663
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,660
Because the less they know, the less they'll talk.

664
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,680
The best Patsy is when you're ready to pull an assassination or whatever.

665
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,660
You drag him into it while it's going on.

666
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
Immediately, he doesn't know anything.

667
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,420
The poor guy's trying to wave down a cab.

668
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,480
Well, right. And you arrest him as the assailant because he's got nothing to say.

669
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,100
And that's the thing.

670
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,040
He winds up getting killed before he even realizes.

671
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,720
It's like, what the hell? You're like, there's no grooming.

672
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,080
See, what I'm trying to say is that I think a lot of the hypnosis

673
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,340
with the trigger words and all that still confabulated because it's risky.

674
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,060
If you like do MK Ultra with a trigger word on someone,

675
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,200
you know, that's only like still 60 or 70 percent effective.

676
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,320
What if 30 percent of the time it doesn't work?

677
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,460
And they come out and say, oh, no, I'm not a Patsy.

678
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,140
I work with the CIA. No way.

679
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,500
They're just going to pick some random.

680
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,440
They know with with Oswald, they had some grooming with Oswald to a degree.

681
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,720
That's why he said, I'm just a Patsy.

682
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,880
They don't even want to hear that.

683
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,500
That's why I've been saying that right now.

684
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,760
Actually, I've noticed since 9-11, especially

685
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,960
and especially since the Boston thing, the the the flash bomb,

686
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,360
they told you it was a pressure grill just because I saw that while I was

687
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,500
that's that's just a flash bomb.

688
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,440
I was around military people.

689
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,980
Yeah, that's a flash bomb we use in training.

690
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,060
So but.

691
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,000
Since then, they make sure that no one in the public eye is read into anything

692
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,620
because of the Freudian slips that can come right.

693
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,640
So when you see these politicians telling you or the sheriff said it's a terrorist

694
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,300
attack, they honestly believe that

695
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,140
they no longer allow anyone that's read into it to be on camera.

696
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,140
Well, because of the slips that could happen.

697
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,600
Well, not only that, but you could have somebody turn around and decide

698
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,960
differently, you know, all of a sudden, if somebody escapes,

699
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,700
who wasn't supposed to escape and they have knowledge, you got a problem,

700
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,980
you know, because they could reveal something that's true.

701
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,160
You got to have the completely unaware or the completely brainwashed

702
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,460
up in front of the cameras, because that's the only way.

703
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,680
Look, it's just like an actor. What does an actor do?

704
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,580
Well, they convince themselves that they are that character, right?

705
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,700
They go into character.

706
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
They are that person.

707
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,620
They have to be that way in order to present something

708
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,160
that is remotely presentable, that makes sense.

709
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,360
That's like believable.

710
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,640
So you need people that are all on board with being that character.

711
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,080
What's the best way to do it?

712
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,600
To have them believe nothing else.

713
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,780
They are that character.

714
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,100
So you make them into that character and you don't tell them

715
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,080
any of this, that it's a movie, that it's a show, that it's not real.

716
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,940
You don't do that. You can't do that.

717
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,700
This is what they do.

718
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,880
They used to because they they knew they could scrub them off.

719
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,300
Like a good example of this is alleged, but I don't know if you've heard this.

720
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,680
When the Apollo thing happened, there was a lot of actors and crew.

721
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,540
And one of the people involved was a relative of someone

722
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,420
who was in the comms division.

723
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
And Nixon was a big diehard.

724
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,820
Nixon was like, you know, we'll go to the moon, but we can't show any pictures.

725
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,500
And Nixon said, oh, you have to show pictures.

726
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,100
You have to show.

727
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,060
Nixon was really big on showing pictures.

728
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,800
Right. But after they did all that stagecraft, some comm got out

729
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,740
that Nixon's plan was to erase all those people that were behind the scenes

730
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,640
because he didn't want it ever leaking out.

731
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,040
And they ran to Cambodia because Vietnam was going on the same time.

732
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,440
So they figured if they go nearby, they'll be safe.

733
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,180
So Nixon found out through other intel that they're in Cambodia.

734
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,960
So he says, let's start bombing Cambodia to get these guys.

735
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,560
This is how stupid it can be.

736
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,060
Right. So they actually start carpet bombing, because if you see

737
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,860
where they were carpet bombing Cambodia during that time, didn't make any sense.

738
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,660
It was it was little little enclaves and places where tourists went or, you know.

739
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,240
Right. And the weird thing about that is the justification in public is, well, OK,

740
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,659
the Viet Cong are retreating into Cambodia after they stage an attack.

741
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,139
So we have to bomb Cambodia.

742
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,120
And the American public goes, OK, makes sense.

743
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,560
But if you look at the map where the carpet bombing happened,

744
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,179
it doesn't make any sense at all.

745
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,840
There's no continuity because they had intel on where these guys were hiding out

746
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,340
or trying to restart their lives.

747
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,699
Right. There's a couple of border areas that get hit.

748
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,600
But the majority of the bombing.

749
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,400
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, you could tell it was they were actually it was very strategic.

750
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,739
In other words, it was surgical.

751
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,940
Yeah. Right. But it was but it didn't make any sense.

752
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,020
But once you start to hear what I just said, it says, of course, it makes sense

753
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,440
that they would do something like that.

754
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it.

755
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,780
But what I'm saying is at the time, the American public.

756
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,120
And that was the thing that was supposed to be public doesn't count.

757
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah. That was supposed to be one of the things

758
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,980
they were going to impeach him on is bombing Cambodia.

759
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,940
And I mean, you know, Nixon's response, the president can bomb anybody he wants,

760
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,100
which is true. He did.

761
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,520
Well, yes. Yeah, that's true.

762
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,320
But yeah, you know, they call the president commander in chief.

763
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,260
He's not unless Congress declares war.

764
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,020
Yes. True. So it's all it's all mixed up.

765
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,820
It's all jumbled up.

766
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,060
It's kind of like I've seen people go into court and they try to cite the law

767
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
and the judge will listen.

768
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,580
He says, that's not what it says, like right in front of you.

769
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,700
It's like that's not what you call it.

770
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,880
Deflecting when it's when you're speaking to someone and they deflect.

771
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,220
That's very hard to deal with because then it then it fucks with your reality.

772
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,240
It's like, wait a second.

773
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,540
This person said it's not like that.

774
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,780
I know it's like that my whole life.

775
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,240
Now it's not what the hell's going on.

776
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,280
So it's very, very difficult.

777
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,800
The deflection part.

778
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,840
So all you got to do, you know, someone reads something as sure as day

779
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,760
and you tell them that's not what it says.

780
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,600
And they're like, huh?

781
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,520
That's like a real mental screwball right there.

782
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,420
And this is what they've been doing to the public for so long.

783
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,940
They're used to it and they resonate with it.

784
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,660
That's all they do.

785
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,900
So. All right.

786
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,020
Well, I don't know.

787
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Let's just make it a short one.

788
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,620
I just wanted to maybe interject what's going on.

789
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I hope this abatement of Lee is successful.

790
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,340
If it's not, we'll see also. Right.

791
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,960
So we'll definitely see.

792
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,880
And look, there's plenty more fear porn to come anyway,

793
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,860
because we have to get ready for the twenty twenty four events.

794
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,340
I'll close this one by asking you this,

795
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,420
and maybe we'll we'll do it in the future, Sonic.

796
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,740
But in the year that they call twenty twenty four coming up, I've already got

797
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,500
usually people talk about this toward the end of the calendar year.

798
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,940
But I've already got requests from people.

799
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,060
And by the way, I know that some people get get the hell scared out of them

800
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,800
when you start talking about weather on these.

801
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,800
And they've told me that in the distant past, even on previous sides.

802
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,260
There's just a couple of people like, man, he starts talking about whether

803
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,020
I get creeped out.

804
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,720
Look, it is OK. Well, just get a handle on it.

805
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,120
Yeah. Yeah. Get a handle on it.

806
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,180
But, you know, I think in the near future, I might want to ask you about

807
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,440
that calendar year of twenty twenty four, because

808
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
I think there's a lot of plans here.

809
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,540
There's a lot going on.

810
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,760
Well, it's going to wrap up what I've been saying about this seven year period,

811
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,220
which ends by twenty twenty five. Right.

812
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,060
That's why I was asking you about it.

813
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,280
So and I recall that this is when certain things should begin.

814
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,880
And you and I started talking about this kind of stuff.

815
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,180
What? Six, seven years ago, where you were telling me all about

816
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,240
a bunch of different events that we're going to begin to really roll out

817
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,360
around that time.

818
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,660
And I'm saying to myself, well, maybe it'll be talk about it soon.

819
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,340
We're here. Yeah.

820
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,840
And well, let's see if it happens. Right.

821
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,480
But the thing that I'm saying is that they will not make sense

822
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,640
and they will be immediate and very fast.
