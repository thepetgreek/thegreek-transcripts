1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,180
Another Sonic event, Ocelli in the Greek Rated Y, and Greek, but let's just start this way.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,300
What day is it?

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,080
Let's begin with time.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Well, it's whatever day you want it to be, right?

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,260
Fun day, whatever day, right?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm reckoning around the 19th of the 7th month.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,600
19th of the 7th month.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,420
Yeah, around there.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,540
So we, so in other words, this, this was pretty close to the Pope's work schedule, but it's

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,200
drifting again.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,560
Like last month was a day off.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,900
Now it's two or three days off.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,100
Cause as I see it right now on the Pope's work schedule, yeah, it's the 19th day of

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,180
the 12th.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,200
Well, it's the 16th day of the 12th, excuse me, 16th day of the 12th month.

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,300
So we're at about three days.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,440
Cause it was about three, it was like the 28th or something, 29th, 16th day, 12th, 9th

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,480
month, according to that.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,260
But of course, September makes no sense because Sept is seven.

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,140
So why are we doing it?

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,440
No, no.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
September makes sense, but calling it the ninth month doesn't.

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,440
That's what I was saying is that I said ninth month, so I'm, I'm all screwing it up.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,320
But the point is, and that's, that is the point, isn't it?

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,100
September.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,120
September makes sense.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,300
October makes sense.

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,740
But calling October the 10th month doesn't make sense.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,000
Right.

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,780
Calling, right?

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,100
December the 12th month doesn't make sense at all.

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,380
No.

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,460
Sept should be seven.

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,060
Right.

37
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,120
Sept should be seven.

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,300
Oct should be eight.

39
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,640
Eight, right.

40
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,920
I mean, octo, octagon, et cetera.

41
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,840
I mean, we know this, but yeah, the shape of my head tonight.

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,180
Yeah.

43
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,700
Octagon.

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,320
Sure.

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,180
Anyway, I was joking.

46
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,420
Yeah.

47
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,160
Why not?

48
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,780
Look, it could be because you're not from this planet.

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
That was a question from a while ago.

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,100
I don't remember if we answered it.

51
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,460
That's if you think it's a planet, but either way, what planet is the Greek from was the

52
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:45,700
question.

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,140
Oh man.

54
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,940
That's the thing.

55
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,580
I think that does it.

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,580
That part doesn't matter.

57
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,600
It doesn't affect anything.

58
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,760
What planet is any of us from?

59
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,060
You know, look, just because we say it's something called Earth doesn't mean that that's not

60
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,060
what somebody looking at it, you know, in their sky.

61
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,960
Well, it's not.

62
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,840
There's an old saying.

63
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,660
It's not where you're from.

64
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,740
It's where you're at, where you're going.

65
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,380
Right.

66
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,020
Right.

67
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,160
But yeah.

68
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:07,900
Well, bring up.

69
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,060
Timekeeping came up in a tangential way in the past few days, and I was thinking of doing

70
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,460
that more pedantically, you know, meaning doing detail, a lot of detail that almost

71
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,820
hurts.

72
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,580
Oh boy.

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,260
On the solo sonics.

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,980
And I haven't abandoned that project is a lot.

75
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,740
There's a 200 hours of stuff there.

76
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,080
What's happening is I'm in an all consuming rage and developing water stuff right now.

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,460
And we've gotten to the point where if in all seriousness, if I go public with what

78
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,000
can be done with almost very little, your life would probably be threatened back in

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,560
the days.

80
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,340
Right.

81
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,440
Like what I mean by that?

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,780
You know, Bill Cooper and all these guys, right, if they did what they did now, I think

83
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,520
they'd be OK.

84
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,020
Right.

85
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,480
They just had a different approach.

86
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,440
Oh, yeah.

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,000
Back then.

88
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
You know what I mean?

89
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,620
Well, look, so you can get away.

90
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,460
You can get away with quite a bit more now because it's a lot easier to get lost, too,

91
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,760
because you could just now be one.

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,980
That's just one not screaming that on the Internet.

93
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,740
Who cares?

94
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,100
You can say a great many things that are a little dangerous and not necessarily have

95
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,880
somebody break down your door the next day.

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,900
Well, that's presuming, I think, that, see, they know they they they in quotes, air quotes

97
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,780
or whatever, quote those people.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,160
Yeah.

99
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah.

100
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,700
They know that it's not who's saying it's who's listening.

101
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,620
Exactly.

102
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:30,860
Right.

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,280
Right.

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,620
So that's why you'll never get any airtime on on mainstream because it's not them.

105
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,640
I mean, if you get, let's say, Greek speak on mainstream, that would up the quality,

106
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,380
you know, met a magnitude of ways.

107
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,420
But it's not that you're upping their quality.

108
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,700
It's that's who's listening.

109
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,040
You see, it's always who's listening on the other.

110
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,480
And so.

111
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:49,940
Right.

112
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,120
So it doesn't say much.

113
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
It could go either way.

114
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,020
But yeah, I just want to recap on the weather also that, let's say, from certain channels

115
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,620
I had gotten word before it even went down.

116
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,740
This was designed to really hurt the physical country.

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,100
And I did spend quite a bit of time and I got a little signaling back or how do you signal

118
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,480
back?

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
Remember, I talked about spy versus spy.

120
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,320
Yeah.

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,720
Right.

122
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,360
Yeah.

123
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,360
How do I get to bookmark certain things?

124
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,120
And I came back when I decided to slid on the up and those bookmarks had disappeared

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,300
and a few other things were rearranged on the screen on the laptop that I'm using.

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
That's a very subtle way.

127
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,640
Right.

128
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
Very, very subtle.

129
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,060
Right.

130
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,540
And I noticed the subtle things.

131
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,000
I enjoy it.

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah.

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,060
And look, you know, and there used to be this thing.

134
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,560
Now, look, I read up when I was very young.

135
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,100
I read up the legend of Charles Manson.

136
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,700
I call it the legend because the truth of that matter, what actually happened, a whole

137
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,600
other thing aside from, you know, the the ghost written book that had Vince Bugliosi's

138
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,400
name on it, you know, and and but I did read that.

139
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,360
And I remember one of the big stories was that for a little bit.

140
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,020
It's strange.

141
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,400
It's a methodology for a little bit, though.

142
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,160
He was having his so-called family members, you know, the girls that he had control over

143
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,540
that were all living at Spawn Ranch.

144
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,940
He would send them into people's houses, not to steal, not to kill.

145
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,380
Nothing like that, but just go in there and move some stuff around and leave.

146
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,640
Do something witchy became the phrase.

147
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,060
But they would go in there and just move things around and spook people a bit.

148
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,280
Now, it's funny to me because I've heard that methodology having been employed by guess

149
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,500
who?

150
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,120
People that are involved in that agency to give a subtle warning to somebody, you're

151
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
getting a little close.

152
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,100
So maybe somebody, you know, you come home after you haven't been there for two days.

153
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,660
You live alone and maybe there's a cat in the house.

154
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,120
You know that that hot brewed cup of coffee sitting on your kitchen counter wasn't made

155
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,800
by the cat.

156
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,280
And nobody appears to have been in your house, from what you can tell.

157
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,380
And you haven't been.

158
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,980
I wouldn't mind.

159
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,860
I've got a colony of nine cats, not in the house outside.

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,760
But so if the cats were gone, let's say, and the coffee was always hot, I wouldn't be.

161
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,160
I'd be happy with that, actually.

162
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,040
Well, you might be.

163
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,180
But would you trust the coffee you didn't make yourself?

164
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,740
You see.

165
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,620
Anyway.

166
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,400
But my point.

167
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,920
I gotcha.

168
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,780
Sometimes I don't trust the coffee I do make myself.

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm not.

170
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,820
I'm not paying attention.

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,480
Coffee is a very, very meticulous and fine thing to make.

172
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,440
It's actually people talk about wine tasting and such sommeliers.

173
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,500
They taste for about 70 different qualities in the wine, but coffee tasters taste for

174
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,280
over 120.

175
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
Anyway, well, there's a lot to it.

176
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,980
I mean, I went and got some of the, you know, more, you know, surface level barista training

177
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,640
and all that.

178
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,260
And a whole lot of things.

179
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,660
Funny.

180
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,960
A whole lot of stuff that you've discussed with food preparation on occasion.

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,260
Sounds a lot like what they tell us to do when it comes to barista training, like a

182
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,760
bunch of the things that you're supposed to do to clean things.

183
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,660
You know, the very like, oh, well, I should use a heavy detergent and all this.

184
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,200
Are you crazy?

185
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,820
Don't do that.

186
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,460
You know, like this is the way you're supposed to, you know, make sure everything is wiped

187
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,140
down and all that kind of stuff because transference of oil, et cetera, et cetera.

188
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,360
Very easy thing to do.

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,080
So, yeah, they really, you know, yeah, well, how many baristas are a part of the intelligence

190
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,020
agencies, too?

191
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,260
Right.

192
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,400
I think that's where they go.

193
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,600
You know, tack cab drivers, bartenders.

194
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,020
Right.

195
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,420
You know.

196
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,000
Fair enough.

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,100
But they do need to be able to do those jobs adequately enough to participate occasionally

198
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,820
as a cover.

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,840
But the thing is, like I said, switching paintings from one side of a room to another weird stuff

200
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,420
like that.

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:29,980
Yeah.

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
You know, that kind of stuff.

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,980
It's funny because it's like Manson's family was doing it and they were supposedly just

204
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,720
crazy kids on LSD.

205
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,760
They were not.

206
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,980
They were part of a group out of that canyon in California.

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,560
Right.

208
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:41,960
Right.

209
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,660
Affected.

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
You know what it's like.

211
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
You know what I'm talking about.

212
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:44,600
Yeah.

213
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,780
Laurel Canyon and all that.

214
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,500
But the deal is that it's just funny to me that the methodology is the same and nobody

215
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,600
points that out where, you know, the thing that they were supposedly doing is a prank,

216
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
which is funny.

217
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,440
It's not a prank.

218
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,860
It's actually communicating a very sophisticated symbol.

219
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,880
There might even be meaning behind the fact that they decided to shuffle your papers,

220
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,620
you know.

221
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,460
Yeah.

222
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,180
Sure.

223
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,120
But either way.

224
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,380
And before we started, I think I showed you a diagram of a wind map that's that that's

225
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,140
kind of like off the wind map I showed you during the op is just as strange as a UFO landing

226
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,780
on your front lawn and parking there.

227
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,060
Right.

228
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah.

229
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,180
Takes you a minute.

230
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,520
And no one notices.

231
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,320
You know, I mean, I mean, this is very noticeable.

232
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,840
It's like, you know, life is kind of surreal, I'd say, always, always is, always was.

233
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,600
But it depends on what you're paying attention to.

234
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,580
You know, is it surreal or is it just boring as hell because you're only looking down at

235
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,000
three feet of space around your feet?

236
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,900
You know, I just it is what it is.

237
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,600
If you look up, you know, it's just another thing, too.

238
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,280
Before we continue, let me just do a quick shotgun how the day starts at noon.

239
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,200
OK, go ahead.

240
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,800
Really simple.

241
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,260
If you want to just use biblical references before I get into that, if you look up any

242
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,480
of the astronomical references, it's mentioned solar noon is when the day starts for for

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,420
scientific and astronomical purposes.

244
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,400
Right. Right.

245
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,340
But the civil changes.

246
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,100
Right. So if you live in a religious whatever they do there, they consider that to be civil.

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,120
Right. If you live in a what is it called when you when the country is run by a religion,

248
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,100
theocracy, theocracy.

249
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,140
Yeah. Like Saudi Arabia or parts of Jerusalem, for example, is theocracy, theocratic.

250
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,740
You know, the mayor, you know, they tell you, you know, but if you live in Jerusalem, don't

251
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,220
you can't. There's no there's no public services on the Sabbath, but other parts of Israel

252
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,980
there is. So so but OK, so before I think that's enough to look at, you could look at

253
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,920
also the timekeeping authorities, which is the Greenwich Meantime and the Naval Observatory

254
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,660
in Colorado. They both have websites.

255
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,360
You say the same thing.

256
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,960
Biblical is very easy.

257
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,600
You want to go you want to go the latest in time or there it's all Old Testament, by the

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,880
way. New Testament is not a study document.

259
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
It's good to read.

260
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
OK. And OK. Why?

261
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,480
Well, before I get into this, anything the Catholics put out, the Catholic Church is a

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,960
lie, period, anything and everything.

263
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,100
So you want to avoid anything that's endorsed by them.

264
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,980
Now, let's take it a little further.

265
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,480
Don't they tell you the Old Testament has been done away with?

266
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,340
It's all the New Testament anyway, makes it even worse.

267
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,820
So you don't want to read. You want to be familiar with it, of course.

268
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,540
Read it. But I pay it no mind.

269
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,360
It's completely adulterated.

270
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,700
There's there's not much there in terms of study material.

271
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,260
The reason I read the New Testament, obviously, is because it is the only record we

272
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,440
have of what the Christ had said, allegedly.

273
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,440
And it shows what prophecies have been fulfilled, allegedly.

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,470
Right. And but if you know how to read the New Testament, then read it.

275
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,980
Boy, did I just confuse people?

276
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,140
If you know how to read it, then you should definitely read it.

277
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,740
But in terms of a general consensus, you're not going to get anything from it.

278
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,380
Because it's been you have to know.

279
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,080
Well, give me an example.

280
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,020
Chuck, you do the research that you do.

281
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,880
If you if you get let's say the CIA puts out a publication, you know how to read it.

282
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,740
Right. Yes. You can tell what part they put in.

283
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,960
That's B.S. and what they're actually leaving in.

284
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,980
Right. Yes, of course.

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,680
That's the average people take the whole thing at face value.

286
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,980
Prima facie, you know.

287
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,960
Right. I see this all the time.

288
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,020
Look, you see a document and it says, OK, we're recording this and this is the

289
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,440
memorandum. And people focus on, oh, they said this happened.

290
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,880
And I go, no, that's not the point of the document.

291
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,300
Yeah, it's not the report.

292
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,520
That's a report.

293
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,960
It is your the only thing that's really if you want the book of Matthew, like the

294
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,080
first chapter, if you can really solve that, you know, the genealogy, then you

295
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
should continue. I'll leave that.

296
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,000
OK, I'll leave that, because most people say there's an anomaly that says 42

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
generations. They only count 41.

298
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,060
If you solve it, how there are 42 and not 41 that you count, then you should

299
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,280
continue. But otherwise, you're just playing along the Muppet tree of the of

300
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,180
the current Christian.

301
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,900
By the way, if you're a Christian, you're under you're considered one of the pope's

302
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,400
army. Doesn't matter if you think you're Protestant or Mormon or whatever.

303
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,060
OK, so just on that measure alone, just you got homework to do.

304
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, they do. And they do tell you that if you ever read any of the hymns or any

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,540
of the other stuff like not. And I don't mean read the whole of it.

306
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,920
I mean, just read the book ends of it, so to speak.

307
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,560
You find it says, look, even the Methodist.

308
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,320
Right. Oh, that's a breakaway from the church.

309
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,620
And I'm like, and no, it's not read their stuff.

310
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,540
It literally says we're under the Catholic Church.

311
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,300
Yeah, all of it. You know.

312
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,740
So but they tell you in their documentation right there, you're going to go sing our

313
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,100
songs. Guess what? You know, you're under the Catholic Church, right?

314
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,620
Yeah, it always is. So it's kind of disgusting.

315
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,980
But that's more than an opinion, by the way.

316
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,340
It's just an unspoken truth.

317
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,380
When you speak bad about something, they'll say, well, you could.

318
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
That's his opinion, right?

319
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
Mm hmm. My opinion is based on unspoken things, right?

320
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,080
That should be spoken.

321
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,740
By the way. OK, so let's go.

322
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,940
So maybe we'll go backwards in time.

323
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,900
So in other words, the latest one, if you look at the book of Nehemiah, OK, he gave

324
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:26,500
the crowd a hard time because they were conducting business and the Sabbath had

325
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,460
already started. And before I get into that, he was at the city walls.

326
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,780
Now, the city walls are about 15 or 16, 20 feet thick.

327
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,820
And the way you go through those walls is through a gate.

328
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
And those gates are large archways.

329
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,060
Now, if anyone's been in, if you want a good example of what it looks like, look it

330
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,200
up. The gates in Jerusalem, the old city.

331
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,260
Another another example would be in Central Park in certain Central Park in New

332
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,000
York. They have these bridges, these small ornamental stone bridges.

333
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,460
Right. Right.

334
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,640
And they're about 15, 16 feet wide.

335
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,960
Right. So let's go back to Nehemiah.

336
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,300
These gates. So you got it's like an archway that in a wall that's 15 to 20 feet

337
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,840
wide. So he's anyway, go back to Nehemiah.

338
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,340
He's complaining about the Sabbath has begun and he's yelling at people.

339
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,980
Why are you still conducting business?

340
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,200
And what was his what? How did he prompt in the text that the Sabbath had begun?

341
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
He says it's dark under the gates.

342
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,820
Mm hmm. Right now, if the gates are up and down on up and down vertical archway in

343
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,380
early morning, the light goes straight in the late.

344
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,700
Right. The sun is low.

345
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,300
The sun is low. So the underside is lit.

346
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,380
I have a low porch in the back in the morning.

347
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,560
It's all completely lit.

348
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,080
Now, at sundown, I have a porch in the front.

349
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,920
It's completely lit because the sun is horizontal.

350
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,400
Light goes right under the arch.

351
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,940
Right. Right. So the only the only way.

352
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,640
The only way it could be dark under the archway is if the sun is directly above it.

353
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,140
You think shadow?

354
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Yeah, if it is daylight around, but it's dark under that archway, then that means,

355
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,200
yeah, it's absolutely noontime.

356
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,220
OK, so that may not be that might be ambiguous.

357
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,380
There's actually a couple of idiots that do YouTube's that bring that up.

358
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,340
I see it's dark, so it must be sundown.

359
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,160
I'm like, oh, my gosh, no, completely moronic.

360
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,360
Yeah, that but that's perfect that they do that because it shows you once you bring up

361
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,460
the subject of religion, whoever is up at the dais or the pulpit, you know, is correct.

362
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,240
Right. They don't know that the person that's up there is there to mislead you.

363
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,500
But because people who know these things don't listen to people like that.

364
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,120
And I'm not really this is not religious.

365
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,440
By the way, I don't believe anything in the Bible.

366
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,620
I use it as a rule book.

367
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,340
Right. It's you're not supposed to believe you're supposed to know.

368
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,420
And I use it as a directive for knowledge.

369
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,580
So I'm not religious. I'm actually anti-religious in the way the

370
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,280
it's set up. OK, back to Nehemiah.

371
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,000
So he prompted that people that it was dark under the archway.

372
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
So the Sabbath had begun.

373
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,840
Right. Now, if you're not sure about that, he gives a second example.

374
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,120
The second example is that he says it's the Sabbath and he says, this time, I don't want

375
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,080
you to start doing your business until it gets hot.

376
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,400
Until it begins to get hot at the gate, I want the gates to get hot.

377
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,600
All right. So it's so it's not hot yet.

378
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,160
Not warm, but hot. Right.

379
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,300
So when is that?

380
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,280
When does it begin? Things begin to get hot at noontime as it approaches noon.

381
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,360
The morning is always cool.

382
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah. Take a look at your peeker to your higher temperatures are always in the midst of the

383
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,880
day when the sun is between noon and afterwards.

384
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,880
Yeah. Between noon and three.

385
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,780
Now, it's not sundown because it's starting to cool down.

386
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,900
Right. So he's saying, wait until they heat up.

387
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,080
Right. Okay. So so we know that it has to be dark underneath and it has to be hot.

388
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,540
They have to be heated. So that brings you to noon.

389
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,780
Okay. There's a couple of ambiguous ones in the Book of Kings when things start.

390
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,640
The couple of ambiguous ones that can go either way in the Book of Exodus.

391
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,520
Book of Kings, by the way, when the day starts, it's noontime because they have a new

392
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,420
moon festival. So you go research that.

393
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,180
Notice I'm not giving chapter and verse.

394
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,940
Right. The reason I don't give chapter and verse is these Christian idiots.

395
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,160
Matthew 15, 21, 36, 5, 5.

396
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,940
Right. It's like, oh, my gosh, it's kind of like a Marine sergeant or, let's say, Luke

397
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,580
46, 31 or John 3, 17.

398
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm like, oh, my gosh, it sounds like two old beef patty sauce.

399
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,720
Right. Hold the lettuce.

400
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,900
It sounds like a jingle. Right.

401
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,360
They're ridiculous when they do that.

402
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,820
It's kind of like the reason you shouldn't give verse chapter like that, because you

403
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,920
only be on this level, be talking to people who already know it.

404
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,740
Just like, for example, hey, you want to hear chapter and verse.

405
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
You see the movie Matrix at four minutes and 32 seconds that what's any better than

406
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,460
that? What? Who?

407
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,840
Who talks about theater and movies and previous events that way?

408
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,900
Hey, only remember in Star Wars at 12 minutes, 31 seconds.

409
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,680
Luke Skywalker busted a nut.

410
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,320
And what? What?

411
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,300
What? What did you say?

412
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,120
Yeah. There used to be a guy.

413
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,360
There used to be what you remind him of is there used to be a guy called Mr.

414
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,600
Skin. And what he did is he would tell you where people were nude in movies.

415
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,460
And that's exactly how he did it at three minutes, 32 seconds of he would do that all

416
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,560
the time. And that's exactly who you find, you know, because, yeah, but it's

417
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,260
ridiculous. That means you don't know what's going on and you're conditioned just

418
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,760
like, you know, people are conditioned.

419
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,460
You talk to people in the corporate world.

420
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,060
Oh, my gosh. Talk about conditioning.

421
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
I feel so sorry for them.

422
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,780
But anyway, but only as sorry as like for five seconds.

423
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,240
Right. Because, you know, they don't know.

424
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,020
And when someone doesn't know, you just don't know.

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,300
And I'm not here to educate anyone.

426
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,420
I'm just here to share. And if you're willing to pick up the pieces and put them

427
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,640
together, that's great. So you notice I don't give verses.

428
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,280
So Booker Nehemiah, when he talks about the Sabbath and the gates, by the way, it's

429
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,520
around chapter seven and chapter 13 around there, like the middle of the book.

430
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
Right. OK.

431
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,080
OK, so the one in David, the one with Kings is regarding like when he meets all

432
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,420
about the New Moon Festival starting and he could tell it's daytime.

433
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,100
Also, when he meets Jonathan in the field, you can tell it's noontime the next day

434
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,980
if you understand the setting.

435
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,780
But let's go to the beginning.

436
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,900
There was evening and there was morning the first day.

437
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,200
OK, so when does evening end?

438
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
Right. And when does morning end?

439
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,580
Right. Where does evening begin?

440
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,980
It seems like evening begins when morning ends.

441
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,980
Right. So you could look at it that way.

442
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,160
OK, so now if you look at it, Edeb.

443
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,240
You know how they say I've seen this with people, you know, be like twelve or one

444
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,600
and they'll say good morning and like it's twelve or one.

445
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,700
Oh, I'm sorry. Good afternoon.

446
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,520
Right. Notice that. Yeah.

447
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,380
Or or it'll be eleven fifty nine by the wind up tour and they go good afternoon.

448
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh no, it's eleven fifty nine.

449
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,080
You have to say good morning. Right.

450
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
You notice that? Yes.

451
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah. Because people are very rigid.

452
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,280
They don't know the conditioning is very, very strong.

453
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,480
OK. The same thing is with Edeb.

454
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,300
Even in modern culture, Edeb means good afternoon is noon and all the way

455
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
till you go to sleep.

456
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,280
And right before that, the last thing you say to someone would be Laila.

457
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,520
By the way.

458
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,060
Laila, if you don't say like if you're having an evening call six, seven o'clock,

459
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,280
you don't say Laila, you still say Edeb, even if it's eight, nine o'clock.

460
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,260
Right. Only the last thing you say to someone till the next day would be Laila.

461
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,940
And when you're speaking to someone who's Hebrew, when you say Laila, the longer

462
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,840
you say Laila, the more that you like them.

463
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,980
Right. So so very serious.

464
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,560
You'd say Laila and they say Laila, right.

465
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,960
But if you really like them, you go Laila.

466
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,320
And if they go Laila, go back.

467
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,020
They love you, too. It's kind of a funny cultural thing.

468
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,040
I just thought I'd bring it up.

469
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,660
A little sing songy thing that's kind of actually seems to be

470
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,320
pronounced that way in a lot of languages.

471
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,080
People will do that. Stretch it out.

472
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,540
Yeah. But especially in Hebrew.

473
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,680
So anyway, just to keep moving on.

474
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,200
So the Hebrew bracket, I mean, the Edeb also means to be it's the

475
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,660
if you look at the letters, it means to be emanating from the head of the house.

476
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,120
OK, that's what the word literally means to to come out of the head, the top of the house.

477
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,520
So in this case, the house would be the sky.

478
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,160
Right. So where's the top anyway?

479
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,200
Right. The very top.

480
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,380
The apex would be new.

481
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,660
OK, so. Right.

482
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,860
And if it's evening and morning the first day.

483
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,920
So basically it goes from evening to morning.

484
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,700
And when morning ends, your day count ends.

485
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,380
So when does morning end?

486
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,860
And evening begin at noon and noon.

487
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,760
Yeah, it's in your face.

488
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,040
But these things are subtle and they're not discussed.

489
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,340
And don't ever ask me for a chapter in verse.

490
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,920
I think people know that. Right.

491
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,000
So in that way, evening is the beginning of the day because that's afternoon.

492
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,040
And that's exactly the way that evening starts.

493
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,580
Yeah. And when morning ends.

494
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,960
Now, here's the other thing about timekeeping.

495
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,740
You know, time is a form of distance, right?

496
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,240
Now, when you look at a digital thing, it's different.

497
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,740
That that's actually let me just say this.

498
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm not going to expand on this.

499
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,680
But if you understand digital time, a digital clock,

500
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,080
that becomes a highly advanced form of thinking,

501
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,960
which which is why I say, you know, most people are idiots,

502
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,920
but they are capable of extremely high.

503
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,160
Right. It's just the conditioning prevents them. Right. OK.

504
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,620
Yeah. In other words, it's kind of like you're driving a Ferrari

505
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,700
to haul garbage your whole life.

506
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,140
The Ferrari can be on the you know, it's a prestigious car.

507
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,060
Why are you hauling garbage your whole life with it? Right. Right.

508
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,060
I mean, it wasn't even made.

509
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
You could you could use it to haul garbage.

510
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,400
But, you know, those who know will look at you and say that's a waste of a Ferrari.

511
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,580
So when you look at most people, you're like, what a waste of a human.

512
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,140
You know, you can drive a nail into a wall with a gold bar if you like.

513
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,120
But it's a it's not. Yeah, you can do better.

514
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,160
So but anyway, I'm not going to expand on that in the future.

515
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,020
But when I say time is a form of distance, you know, when you look at the windup toy,

516
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,800
the hands as they move, right, you can determine the distance

517
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,520
of between the numbers. Right. Right.

518
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,100
Now, here's the thing.

519
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,340
We used to call them punks, but they're incense sticks.

520
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,600
You ever see when you buy incense sticks, sometimes they sell them

521
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,060
a wooden base that goes over. Yeah, of course.

522
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,960
The horizontal base. Yeah. Well, that's a timekeeping thing.

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
If you look at that base, it has marks on it.

524
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,280
Not like we know they have geometric forms.

525
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,960
But the reason the stick, the sticks were standardized and the base was standardized.

526
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,160
And that's how you kept time.

527
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,380
That was like an hourglass.

528
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,140
But in the Hindu culture, are you ever heard this before?

529
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,500
Yeah, I actually have about the incense. Yes.

530
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,160
Yeah. It's a form of time.

531
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,480
OK. Lamps, quantity of oil.

532
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,140
If you have a standard wick size,

533
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,140
a quantity of oil you can keep time with. Right.

534
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,320
So it's a matter of distance and measurement.

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,460
So so time is always kept with distance and measurement of some form.

536
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,640
If you can't record that accurately.

537
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,940
You're going to have to find a way that you can.

538
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,620
Right. So if you have people talking about

539
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,280
timekeeping in a way that it can't be recorded,

540
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,700
it's it's just cultural thing.

541
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,140
It's like, hey, I'll meet you in the afternoon. Right.

542
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,520
Well, I'll meet you tonight.

543
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,280
But that's not what timekeeping is about.

544
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,740
Timekeeping, as a matter of fact, solar timekeeping, you can go down to,

545
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,840
you know, a thousandth of a second if you want. Right.

546
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,060
They have clocks in India for that.

547
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,360
You know, the longer the wire or the monument, the more accurate. Right.

548
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,780
You can get, you know, a short stick in the ground.

549
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,320
You might get within a few seconds.

550
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,500
But, you know, if you have something that's precisely built,

551
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,920
that's 40 feet tall, you get down to a few thousandths of a second. Right.

552
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,500
So the purpose of timekeeping

553
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,040
is to have a clear, concise measurement.

554
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,140
Now, how are you going to measure something at dawn or at sundown?

555
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,460
You can't. Actually, all the measurement functions are done.

556
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,340
All measurement functions are always done at the apex or zenith of the sky.

557
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,220
Right. So this is a practical thing that's been going on.

558
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,580
And, you know, forever, forever.

559
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,920
By the way, when I tell I say this often, you're never going to do that.

560
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,300
You're never going to figure it out or you're never going to get this.

561
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,500
People say, Greek, how do you know?

562
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,580
Because they think when you say never, it's attached to forever and infinity.

563
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,960
And when I ever say never, it means in the ever that you have left

564
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,500
before you get thrown back into the Stone Age or, you know,

565
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,620
or what's called a reset, right, where you start all over.

566
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,660
So when I when I I'm pretty accurate, I tell someone,

567
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,060
you're never going to figure that out.

568
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,720
Most people will say, well, how do you know?

569
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,620
Because they attach it again to infinity.

570
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm seeing within the time frame that you've got the way you're going.

571
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,360
See, that's why very often when I say that, well, you will never get this

572
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,180
in form of technology or whatever it might be.

573
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,520
Conversation about means in the ever that you have left. Right.

574
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,320
So so these things in terms of timekeeping are

575
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
it's another way of timekeeping, right?

576
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,460
It's it's just duration.

577
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,920
But timekeeping in itself has has to be accurate.

578
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
And the only way to do it is by reckoning at the apex

579
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
of the of the sky.

580
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,560
And this has been known

581
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,760
forever. And that's pretty much it.

582
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,080
And there's a lot of other references you could find in culture.

583
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,720
For example, the simplest one is if you were growing up

584
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,140
before the electronic convention of banks, when you deposited a check afternoon,

585
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,800
they counted it as the next day. Remember?

586
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,900
Yeah. So because they're those bankers, they kept.

587
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,100
The thing about bankers is there.

588
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,580
It's from the part of the legal system, by the way.

589
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,820
It's, you know, anyway, it's about record keeping.

590
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,600
Well, I was going to say, that's what a lot of this is about anyway.

591
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,300
It's about keeping a record.

592
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,500
And it's about, you know, the court record, what it is they're supposed to be doing.

593
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
Don't mix the court with the banks.

594
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,320
The courts is OK.

595
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
Well, the courts are kangaroo courts now.

596
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,160
Yeah, but it's adapted from that because the idea is it's

597
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,940
supposed to be for record keeping, you know.

598
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,260
And there is such a thing as a lawful situation where records,

599
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,440
you know, you go in for an account.

600
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,180
Yeah. But if the only the only lawful stuff you'll find is inside the bank,

601
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,080
not what they do to you or what they like, for example,

602
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,480
when you look at the Federal Reserve

603
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,000
sheet, you know, their balance sheet, it's only one page long.

604
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,220
And on the bottom, they have asterisks and says, we get to do all this

605
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,680
because of special drawing rights means that you don't have that.

606
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,960
You know, they create money off of a signature.

607
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,140
You can't do that. Right.

608
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,460
Right. So that so that's all unlawful.

609
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,900
But on the inside of what they're doing,

610
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,060
they make sure that they have everything in line.

611
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,500
So that's why they also kept the noon time, because they didn't.

612
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,080
There was. OK.

613
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,680
In other words, in the 70s and up to the 80s, when I first saw

614
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Citibank putting portable ATMs

615
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,200
in parking lots in like 1982, I don't know if you remember that.

616
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, I actually do.

617
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,520
Yeah. Yeah. I knew that the solar noon thing was gone.

618
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,700
It was out the window because now it's electronic.

619
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,900
And right. So. Right.

620
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,240
So anyway, and at the time, I didn't I didn't know about the day

621
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,760
starting a solar noon, but now, you know, in retrospect, right, retro causation,

622
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,000
I see how the you know, when everything gets connected,

623
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,460
you don't need to rely on that.

624
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
Right. Well, yeah, you don't catch you detached

625
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,340
the necessity for people to operate in the daylight hours

626
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,320
to do certain things.

627
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,320
Once you do that, it's all out there.

628
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,500
Yeah. In other words, the lawful timekeeping went out for them also

629
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,140
because also what happened around then, actually, it happened earlier

630
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,240
with the advent of the telex machine, which was before the fax.

631
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,740
And it worked over the phone, by the way.

632
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,180
It's just basically a fancy fax that corporations used and shipping companies.

633
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,860
You know, a good way to describe it is a phone line communicates

634
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,420
and a typewriter on the other end bangs out exactly what it's supposed to.

635
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,120
And boom, there it is.

636
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,520
Yeah, that was the telex.

637
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,440
And then the but you know, all that was invented almost 200 years before.

638
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,000
You could look up the dot matrix and all that.

639
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
That was in the 1700s.

640
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,120
They already had that.

641
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,460
But anyway, but it wasn't commercial.

642
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,480
But but the whole thing about

643
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,620
that is also with the telex machine, the stock markets got all connected. Right.

644
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,880
You see, but the stock markets didn't open a certain time.

645
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,020
So the one in Tokyo and New York, you know, had a 10 hour difference,

646
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,560
12 hour difference. Right.

647
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,360
But they were able to still communicate after.

648
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,600
So anyway. Yeah.

649
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,800
So that was a quick insert on that.

650
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,820
But, you know, that's the thing.

651
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,520
You know, I like doing a lot of subjects.

652
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,140
And some people said, if you go on a tangent, come back.

653
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,040
And I try to do it.

654
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,140
But you know what it has to do with is a lot of these things that we talk about.

655
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,580
It's it's what you're interested in.

656
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,580
And you find that

657
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,260
with children, like, what do you want to be when you grow up?

658
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,560
Should I have to grow up?

659
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,680
You know, I'm you know, I'm still in my sixth decade.

660
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,320
I don't know what growing up means.

661
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,740
Yeah. But but this is what I especially young people that haven't been corrupted.

662
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,540
It's like, you know, what should I be interested in?

663
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,740
The answer is everything.

664
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,380
All right. Now, this is this is why it's how you parcel out your consciousness.

665
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,080
And what I mean by that is very simple.

666
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,760
Let's go to a common oaf, common pedestrian person.

667
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,000
You bring up a subject out of the blue.

668
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,860
Let's say it's technical or non-technical.

669
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,020
Let's say I'm not interested in that.

670
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,480
But they're very interested in sitting in front of the tube

671
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,300
for three hours with beer and chips. Right.

672
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,440
OK. You see what I mean?

673
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,580
Yeah. So they've decided that they don't want to be right.

674
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,140
And I think I've given many, many examples in Greek speak

675
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,100
on how people develop interest and shy away and develop this laziness. Right.

676
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,140
Yeah. Now, I do understand why, let's say a typical, you know,

677
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,260
whatever would not be interested in talking about whatever

678
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,600
and rather sit in front of a TV and watch CNN for two hours.

679
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,660
I understand that.

680
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,280
Why? Because it's been measurements done since the 60s

681
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,340
that when someone watches the tube, even the flat screen

682
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,940
after about 20 minutes or so, the brain starts to go more and more into alpha.

683
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,160
Right. It's like a very it's a relaxed state.

684
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,480
Actually, I found a lot of Americans, by the way.

685
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,520
How do I know this?

686
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,980
If I go out to get cigarettes late at night, I look, you know,

687
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,500
look around the neighborhood and I know where the bedrooms are.

688
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,460
I know the floor plan on the houses in the neighborhood and they sleep

689
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,080
with the TV on. Yeah.

690
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,320
A lot of people can't sleep on this, especially the older ones,

691
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,980
unless the television is on. Right. Right.

692
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
So I understand. Yeah.

693
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,500
I understand they'd rather be in the sedated state. Right.

694
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,240
But do I is that someone I want to be associated with?

695
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,600
Absolutely not.

696
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,500
And not not would not in any way ever, because they might be useful somehow.

697
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,660
But is it someone that I would want to, you know, on

698
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,000
the associate with anything beyond the base level?

699
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,460
Absolutely not. Right.

700
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,200
Because you've already know they've already structured themselves.

701
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,280
So there's a certain structure.

702
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,120
So the thing is, when people what should I be interested in everything?

703
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,940
It's just how much time do you want to spend on it? Right.

704
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,920
They do this thing.

705
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,800
I don't like it because it's mainstream, but I do appreciate it.

706
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,020
This thing called fun facts that's been going on for about 20 years now.

707
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,140
Right. Fun fact. Right.

708
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,800
It's trying to get people to get a little more broadener,

709
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,320
you know, learn something about something.

710
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,440
Usually most of it's urban myth anyway. Right.

711
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,660
The best the best fun fact is that, you know, you're just a piece of livestock

712
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,080
legally, legally, you're livestock, you know.

713
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,900
And then but how do you give that as a fun fact that 20 hours of support? Right.

714
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,920
Here's the thing.

715
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,280
There's many levels to all this,

716
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,260
but ultimately a larger consciousness can contain a lesser one.

717
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,920
You know what I mean?

718
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,960
So someone.

719
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,420
That's a rhetorical question.

720
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,220
I don't know. That's the East Coast.

721
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
That's the you know what I mean?

722
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,860
Well, do you know what I mean?

723
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,460
All right. OK. You hear me?

724
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,760
Do you hear me now? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Like that. Right.

725
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,000
So what I mean by that is

726
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,200
a larger consciousness can always contain a lesser one.

727
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,660
And I didn't say person or human or whatever, but consciousness of character.

728
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,840
So someone who tends to be interested in everything

729
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,400
and can easily comprehend someone who isn't right.

730
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,580
Right. Right.

731
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,560
So let's have a neighbor, you know, used to ride motorcycle with him

732
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,980
and he watches football and drinks beer, eats Subway sandwiches. Right.

733
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,220
Yes. Yeah. I completely can.

734
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
I mean, I know I know him better than he knows himself.

735
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,620
What I mean by that is super predictable.

736
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,699
I tell him what he's going to be doing next week before he even does it.

737
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,340
Right. And and to myself, you know, I mean, it's just like, you know,

738
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,639
they already have an obvious, established pattern that they've chosen.

739
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,860
Yeah. And they don't even know they're not even conscious of what they're doing

740
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,940
and how they're like, you know, in a particular way.

741
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,280
But with if he spends three minutes with me, he's like, oh, no, you're going to say

742
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,520
talk about things I can't understand again.

743
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,100
Right. You see.

744
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,179
So I'm not saying it's a larger conscious who will always contain the lesser one.

745
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,139
All right. Let's ramp that up in scale.

746
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:46,239
OK, the elite, whatever they have access to, that's pretty much anything they want.

747
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,760
Oh, Doc, you know, I think I've always mentioned whenever you see an old document.

748
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,719
Right. You have to ask yourself, why did they let they didn't censor this?

749
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,000
Why? Why are they leaving it up on the surface?

750
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,640
What message do they want to give us?

751
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,120
Right. Right. Give me an example.

752
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,600
If you go into the underground or the secret places,

753
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,480
they'll produce, let's say they'll say, give me an old book and they'll give you

754
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,080
something, a scroll or a piece of something that's memorialized paper or whatever.

755
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,440
And they'll look kind of old, you know, like maybe a hundred or whatever years old.

756
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,540
And you look at it and it's a thousand years old.

757
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,420
You're like, my gosh, this is in really good condition, because on the surface,

758
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,520
something that's a thousand years old.

759
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640
I mean, if you just lean, if you look at it the wrong way, it starts to crumble.

760
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,680
Right. Yeah.

761
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,920
They've got things three, four or five thousand years old that look almost, you know,

762
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,220
like an antique, but perfect shape.

763
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,540
Right. You see.

764
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,660
So if you dumb down the people to the point where they have a lesser conscious,

765
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,860
you can contain them because you have a higher conscious.

766
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,160
You understand what's going on.

767
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,340
You understand that you have a continuous, you have continuity of thought.

768
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,460
You know, for example, the technology that you give on the surface is all of it.

769
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,660
Nothing has been invented.

770
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,440
The cell phones and all have always been around.

771
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,160
You go back as far back as you want to go.

772
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,380
They're just trickling right up to the surface. Right.

773
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,460
So they know all this.

774
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,640
So in other words, when you have access to information and you're interested in it

775
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,060
and you come up to the surface or whatever, you don't have to be underground.

776
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm saying, you know, surface, meaning the regular people,

777
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,380
you can look at like someone like let me just this is not because they're like

778
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,400
clerks like the Rothschilds or clerks or whatever.

779
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,840
But let's say someone like that, an Illuminati. Right.

780
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,700
I like the aluminum Ducati. That's right.

781
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,240
That's from what's his name?

782
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,660
Someone sent me a video to look at quantum of consciousness, a YouTuber.

783
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,000
And I like his style, Matt.

784
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,620
I think he'd do well with Greek speak if he got some of it.

785
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,680
But anyway, instead of using that word Illuminati, right?

786
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,800
Aluminum Ducati. I like that.

787
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,760
But anyway, those people, if they come out,

788
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,480
if they have access to all this stuff and they see a commoner,

789
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,920
they can completely contain the consciousness of the commoner

790
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,180
to the point where they can control them using emo, basic emo.

791
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Look, everybody cover yours.

792
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,020
I can control the basic commoner using emo right now.

793
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,280
You know, I mean, look, I think three hundred dollars

794
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,020
for a five gallon bucket of paint is too much. Yeah.

795
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,540
All right. So how much is that? Right.

796
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,000
Or even. Yeah.

797
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,740
We get to the we get to the register.

798
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,180
He brings it up for ten dollars.

799
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,040
And I ask him, is it ten dollars for that paint?

800
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,040
And he says, yes, it is. All right. Thank you. Bye.

801
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,200
It's like, we'll hurry up and get the car right away

802
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,920
before he gets out of his trance. Right. Right.

803
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,080
Yeah. And some people say, well, Greek is stealing.

804
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,060
No, I didn't. I didn't.

805
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,500
I just had him bring it up for heat.

806
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,980
And I asked, I always make sure.

807
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,440
Yeah. Are you sure it's ten dollars?

808
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,940
He's like, yeah.

809
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,800
In other words, these are not the droids you seek.

810
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,920
Remember in Star Wars. Right.

811
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,940
And it's not a mistake.

812
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,300
You know, it's not. Oh, I just wasn't thinking.

813
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,580
Yeah. So I experiment with the commoners frequently.

814
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,440
And I'm like, oh, my gosh.

815
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,380
Did we?

816
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,900
Higher consciousness can contain a lower consciousness.

817
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,760
Yeah, absolutely.

818
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,880
Did we record that?

819
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,020
I think we recorded that conversation about the paint.

820
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,000
You told that story.

821
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,140
Yeah. Oh, this happens often.

822
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,120
This happens with food.

823
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,220
This happens with all kinds of stuff.

824
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,920
Yeah. No, I was just saying in detail.

825
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,440
I think if you go back and it's an experiment, I don't do it often.

826
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
But I do. I do.

827
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,780
When I feel the right time to do it,

828
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,940
I will work on it and see if it works.

829
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,740
But and it has about a 70 to 80 percent success rate,

830
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,380
which is not bad considering a whole lot of other things that have much.

831
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,860
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, it's really cool.

832
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,420
And then, of course, you know, affecting machines and physical things

833
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,560
is interesting as well.

834
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,100
But again.

835
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,040
And I've given all the pieces on how this is done, the email work, right?

836
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,680
You know, some people like it, some people don't.

837
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,100
Some people use it, some people don't.

838
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,040
I haven't gotten any enough feedback on it.

839
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,760
Well, that's something you shied away from, actually, a little bit ago

840
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
when I asked you about it.

841
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,320
And then we we said we wouldn't get into it then was about the you know, OK,

842
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,340
so what happens when you apply this to something

843
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,820
that doesn't typically have a consciousness, right?

844
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,420
What about a machine?

845
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,560
What about a mechanism?

846
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
What about you have to have technical knowledge on the fine point?

847
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,900
Also, what do you want to move?

848
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,920
What kind of a mover do you want to create?

849
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,060
Like, for example, the street lamps are not that hard and cars are not that hard.

850
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,320
You can prevent the car from starting with your mind,

851
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,280
but you have to know the critical component in a car.

852
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,860
For example, if it's a modern car, which most of them are,

853
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,900
I think they had the junk for Jesus, not junk for Jesus.

854
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,720
What was it? The junk clunker cash for clunkers with Obama? Yeah, yeah.

855
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Yeah. They got rid of all the cars that didn't have electronics.

856
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,520
So it was very important that they did that for many reasons.

857
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,020
But, you know, the five volt standard that you have on computers

858
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,780
and cell phones and all that that came from the car industry, right?

859
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,660
The five volt domain rail for a computer inside the circuit board.

860
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,560
It has an ECU, the automobile.

861
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,100
There's a couple of fine points in that circuit board that run on five volts,

862
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,280
and they're very, very fine, especially inside the semiconductor.

863
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,540
If you understand how fine the metal is there and where to detach it,

864
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,620
you can prevent the car from starting with your mind.

865
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,960
The same thing with if you have a street lamp, there used to be silver

866
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,820
sodium bulbs, those real intense bulbs used to use them in gymnasiums.

867
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,180
But people would go to the high school

868
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,200
to watch the basketball game and everybody left with a suntan at night.

869
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,700
You know, silver sodium.

870
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,020
They're very a lot of UV.

871
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,160
It's a very heavy filament.

872
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,060
But inside the glass tube with the base of the filament is that filament is tiny.

873
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,400
It's like 20 microns thick, 20 microns, a little less than a human hair.

874
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,400
If you know where the stress point is that on your mind, create a stress point.

875
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,560
Break that wire right there.

876
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,040
You can make a street lamp go off.

877
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,760
The LEDs street lamp, you'd make that go off again with a five volt controller.

878
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,140
That depends on the design of the LED.

879
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,440
But they do have a five volt controller in there.

880
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,060
Probably some kind of a chip.

881
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,780
You just have to learn about IC chips and then find out the finest point.

882
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,420
And then just at that point is where you affect it.

883
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,580
Right. In other words, if you wave your hand and say, Streetlight, go off.

884
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,800
I'll tell you a thousand years later, you'll still be doing that.

885
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,780
Nothing will happen.

886
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,100
So it does require technical knowledge of the thing.

887
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,720
And it depends if you know, always.

888
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,740
You notice what everything that I mentioned, what it has in common

889
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,080
is you're going after the finest physical point.

890
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,160
So, you know, the chain is as good as its weakest link. Right. Right.

891
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,640
So if you've got a heavy chain and on the end it's connected by a silk thread,

892
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,400
you're going to try to break the big link, the steel link,

893
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,380
or you're going to break the silk thread, you see.

894
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,880
So you find out where it is.

895
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,080
You know, the legal system is the same way, by the way. OK.

896
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,780
Everything. The medical system is the same way, which I saw a comment.

897
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,720
Medical stuff. You know,

898
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,000
I just want to bring this up.

899
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,600
I don't like to address particular direct.

900
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,800
I did in the beginning regarding allergies, a couple of things.

901
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,920
I don't want to.

902
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,700
I found that there's more beneficial if I'm sharing experiences.

903
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,840
You know, give an example.

904
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,160
You know how most people do things in their life and say things in their life

905
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,280
based on what they saw on TV.

906
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,240
Right. Some people are actually a lot more than you think.

907
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,820
And I find that the TV just broadcasts, you know, doesn't go into specifics.

908
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,420
Sometimes you have a call in show or whatever.

909
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,960
I find that if I just discuss the things that I practically do

910
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,600
without thinking about them, they're so simple and so practical.

911
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,080
Because if I get into addressing an issue,

912
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,960
I have to go through all the cobwebs and mothballs and dust bunnies in my brain

913
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,740
and bring up everything I know about that subject

914
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,540
and somehow make a caution, you know, statement about it. Right.

915
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,000
OK. And it's like 10 things want to come out at once and hard to make sense.

916
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,040
Right. But if I start getting into like things I practically do, like,

917
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,620
hey, you want to save money on dish soap,

918
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,080
why don't you dilute it in a spray bottle with some water and borax or whatever?

919
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,220
And you'll be buying just soap twice a year instead of once a month. Right.

920
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,820
I've been right.

921
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,260
Instead of using household cleaners that are toxic,

922
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,960
put some hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle, clean up baby vomit, wipe it.

923
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,480
You know, by the way, if you have something nasty in the house,

924
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,040
like vomit or poop or whatever from a pet or a child,

925
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
don't put the paper towel with your hand.

926
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,980
Grab a plastic bag and not a glove, not a glove. I'll tell you why.

927
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,880
You put your hand in a plastic bag and then and then wipe it with the plastic

928
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,300
bag and then the bag is right there.

929
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,720
Just turn it inside out and retract it. It's gone.

930
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,220
If you have a glove, you know, it's on the glove, right?

931
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,100
Yeah, it's much cleaner to use a plastic bag.

932
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,600
That's what I do all the time, actually.

933
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,760
I got to go pick up something.

934
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,400
I'm going to pick up a piece of paper. And I do have little dogs.

935
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,160
If I got to, you know, they poop on the floor once in a while.

936
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,220
I got to go pick that up.

937
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,400
Sure. I grab a plastic bag and put it down my my wrist,

938
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,740
you know, down my arm a little bit.

939
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,460
And then I go take care of it.

940
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,540
And then I grab from where it is on my forearm,

941
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,240
pull it up and just wrap the bag up. Boom.

942
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,080
Ready to go. Right. Yeah.

943
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,580
So if you put on gloves, you know.

944
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,300
Now, I don't want to shake your hand out with this glove.

945
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,680
Anyway, use hydrogen peroxide and alcohol is a lot better

946
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,920
than these other chemical things with dyes and colors and whatever.

947
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,100
Right. And it's a lot cheaper.

948
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,260
Yeah. You know, much cheaper.

949
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,840
I mean, a bottle of Fantastic's like five, six bucks.

950
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
You look at the amount of volume for a dollar.

951
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,200
You know, you get the same amount of hydrogen peroxide.

952
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,240
It's actually it's fine. Right.

953
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,740
So the other thing I want to mention, if you have food garbage

954
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,680
and it's summertime, put it in the freezer instead of throwing it out

955
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,380
in the can and waiting five, six days for the garbage to pick it up.

956
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,780
Because it's going to rot in the can. Right.

957
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,800
That's for sure.

958
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,100
And then even though it's not in your house, it's still attracting flies.

959
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,400
It's bad. Yeah.

960
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,260
It's it's called tomain radiation.

961
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,640
Tomain is the medical term or Greek term for dead.

962
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,420
It radiates this decay. Right.

963
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,900
But because, for example, of a colony of nine, I call it colony nine.

964
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,860
But there are 10 cats.

965
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,120
So it's called a group of a group of cats is called a colony.

966
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,820
Folks, by the way, some of you know it.

967
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,120
Some of you don't. Right.

968
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,240
Right. Like a murder of crows. Right.

969
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,420
Yeah. And all these other various things.

970
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,560
But anyway, I think people are still in herds, aren't they? Anyway,

971
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,500
I would suggest that, like, for example, when you cook for the animals,

972
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,520
like, you know, you buy a 10 pound bag of chicken parts and you cook right.

973
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,360
Whatever the bones, they go into a bone bag in the freezer

974
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,140
and the garbage day, whatever you take them out.

975
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,440
So all these practical things, I rehashed a whole bunch of stuff.

976
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,180
OK, regarding health, the last week I got into the or the week before

977
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,700
I call it rice number brown rice number seven.

978
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,860
And I gave all the ingredients.

979
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,860
And this has nothing to do with anything that most people

980
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,320
I've gotten some feedback from it.

981
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,940
I think some of it was more appropriate than others.

982
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,180
It was all good. I see more appropriate was the point of giving

983
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,820
that was not to make a delicious meal or something you like or don't like.

984
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,140
It was an example to show that a combination of vegetable things,

985
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,560
you know, from the plant world. Yeah.

986
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,980
They were chosen very specifically for their qualities and their energies

987
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,020
that they emanate from the time they were baby, you know,

988
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,060
till the time they were harvested. Right. Right.

989
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,420
And when you combine them with other the combination, this vegetable

990
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,900
with this vegetable, with that vegetable, with this in rice, brown rice,

991
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,100
but it has to be an organic Bloomberg brown rice.

992
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,320
You will get an effect, right?

993
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,200
It's like a superfood, right?

994
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,080
It's not a matter of saying, like, I like brown rice with onions and peas.

995
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,700
It has nothing to do with that at all.

996
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,680
What you like it.

997
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,940
I hope I gave enough of example why I chose the lotus root, right?

998
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,160
Why I chose the ginger. Why the burdock? Right.

999
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,820
Why? Why the carrot? Why the onion?

1000
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,140
Why you say and how?

1001
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,620
So once you learn this and understand this, by the way,

1002
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,660
most of the feedback that I did get for whoever made it,

1003
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,560
thought it was very delicious. I find it to be extremely delicious.

1004
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,120
I try to make it often.

1005
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,900
OK, so when you understand the energies in the body, like, for example,

1006
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,580
I look at various alternative like rents, bookmark

1007
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,800
and to see what kind of junk they put out. Right.

1008
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,380
It's still stupid.

1009
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,340
I say, well, certain things in coffee prevent cancer in the liver.

1010
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,260
Oh, my gosh. There's nothing.

1011
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,860
The only thing that could prevent cancer or cause cancer is you.

1012
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,720
You're how your body handles the energy, right?

1013
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,480
Because what it is, basically anything, especially I mentioned cancer.

1014
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,740
There's no such thing as cancer. It's just a roadblock, right?

1015
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,220
The energy moves through the body.

1016
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,920
It's funny. Recently, I was speaking to a medical person.

1017
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,860
I said, the body's energetic.

1018
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,660
And they're like, yes, that's right.

1019
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,240
Very, very like dominantly. You know what?

1020
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,340
Yeah, I know that.

1021
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,320
You know, as soon as I brought up a certain point, so I don't know.

1022
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,700
But then because they're entertaining two dichotomy, two things that don't.

1023
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,360
They're entertaining two thoughts.

1024
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,260
They're diametrically opposed. Yeah.

1025
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,460
Yeah. And they maintain those things.

1026
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,940
They need to start putting these thoughts together.

1027
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,600
And so they cancel out and empty their head. Right.

1028
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,700
But anyway, the cancer, all it is, is the body saying, look,

1029
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,460
the energy is all screwed up in your body.

1030
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,160
And I'm going to put this roadblock here.

1031
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,240
They even say it

1032
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,260
when they remove something from your body.

1033
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,760
Don't they say we remove what the blockage blockage?

1034
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the language.

1035
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,580
You got to look.

1036
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,380
That's why you contract the disease.

1037
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,260
Which disease do you want to contract with?

1038
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,460
I have all these medical books.

1039
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,540
Which one do you want to contract with? Right.

1040
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,320
It's a legal term.

1041
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,200
By the way, there is no medical research that's beneficial

1042
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,120
and there is no medical treatment that's being offered

1043
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,540
unless it's cleared by legally first.

1044
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,080
OK, get it.

1045
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,140
So now forget about what the doctors are doing,

1046
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,220
their intention or whatever, but they're just as moronic as the rest

1047
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,700
of society that you're in.

1048
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,020
You have to think about it first.

1049
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,160
As if the doctor is saying something,

1050
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,140
it means it's been cleared by the attorneys.

1051
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,380
Now, what the hell do the attorneys know or care?

1052
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,700
Nothing. I back in the days of bike racing,

1053
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,420
I was doing some mechanicing and I met a bunch of people, big bike race.

1054
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,820
So what do you do?

1055
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,760
She's, oh, I'm a book editor.

1056
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,060
I thought you're an attorney.

1057
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,020
He says, yeah, I am.

1058
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,000
This is what kind of books do you edit?

1059
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,100
This is medical books.

1060
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,280
OK, don't say anything else.

1061
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,980
That's all I need to know.

1062
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,260
Right. That's all I need to know.

1063
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,940
So, yeah, yeah, you're you're you're concerned with the legal part of it.

1064
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,800
And that's that.

1065
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,280
Yeah. So you can omit a whole bunch of things in the study

1066
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,420
that he considers illegal that actually makes it more complete

1067
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,800
and actually which will eventually lead to development.

1068
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,080
Right. Right. Treatment.

1069
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,280
Yeah. So I'm telling you, the people that.

1070
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,180
OK, let me give another example.

1071
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,720
Maybe I should repeat that.

1072
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,400
Attorneys edit medical books, not doctors, not attorneys.

1073
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:47,700
And the only medical experience the attorney has is after he edited books

1074
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,120
for like 10 or 15 years.

1075
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,720
They don't know anything about the medical. OK.

1076
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,260
So when you go to a doctor, I've actually had her doctors tell me

1077
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,440
and dentists tell me legally, I can't tell you to do this.

1078
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,220
What legal?

1079
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,780
So I'm going to the wrong guy.

1080
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,640
She's going to an attorney.

1081
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,340
You know, attorneys, I don't know anything about medicine.

1082
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,140
Right. So you're going to a doctor.

1083
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,880
What makes you think he knows anything?

1084
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,400
It's the same thing.

1085
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,120
It's just like how I explained what you learn about electricity in college.

1086
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,860
Right. Positive one and minus one is zero. Right. Right.

1087
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,580
So it's all legal.

1088
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,000
It's all the whole thing of the banking is still the same way.

1089
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,800
Right. Special drawing rights just means we can do it.

1090
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,840
You can't. Right.

1091
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,520
You heard a special drawing rights.

1092
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,260
SDR is right.

1093
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,780
That's the whole the whole system is based on.

1094
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,260
There's putting it more in your face now.

1095
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,620
Actually, if you read the financial stuff, I don't know if you.

1096
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,420
Well, anyway, there's OK.

1097
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,000
You know what a news bulletin is, right?

1098
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,760
Was it what do they do when you go to certain sites?

1099
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,900
Sign up for a newsletter.

1100
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,980
Newsletters and newsletters.

1101
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,940
Yeah. If you want to learn about what an organization is doing

1102
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,740
and you're interested, they say, here's a sign up for our newsletter.

1103
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,420
Here's actually you go to the newsletter. Why not? Right. Right.

1104
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,400
If you want to know what the federal government is doing,

1105
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,860
they have what's called a federal registry. It's a newsletter.

1106
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,240
Why don't you go read that and then watch what they're saying on TV?

1107
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,580
Right. And tell me if one has anything to do with the other. It doesn't.

1108
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,520
You know, it doesn't at all. Yeah.

1109
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,520
So so, you know, these things I mean, this is insanity.

1110
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,460
So the level of insanity has gotten to the point now that I think just

1111
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,740
basically preaching and teaching to the choir doesn't doesn't work.

1112
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,120
Just sharing a little bit of what you do that you find harmony in

1113
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,260
and whether it's in pieces or makes sense or not.

1114
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,900
People can pick up on it if they could piece it together,

1115
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,420
if they find it to be whole enough and use it would be great.
