1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
Rated Y number 53, okay.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:19,560
So let's get right on into it and well, first, hey Greek, what is happening at the moment?

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,840
I got to tell you, I love the chat room and everything, but the most wonderful piece there

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,060
was actually this little sound effect.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,860
Oh, okay.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,660
You got sound effect, but no, no, that's not a, that's from the chat room.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,080
Somebody put a cricket noise sound effect on YouTube.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,800
Oh, that's fine.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,200
Yeah.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,020
Well, the chat is just another outlet.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,860
It's a communicate.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,720
It's all communication.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,640
Absolutely.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,100
No, I just, I love the cricket sound effect though, because that's one of the best, you

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,560
know, like, you know, nobody is going to react.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,700
Nobody's going to do anything and you can actually hear the crickets cause nothing moves.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,600
Nobody speaks when something happens, but yeah, yeah, but here's the thing.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,519
When you played that, I was like, okay, should I say anything at a, yeah, most of those sounds

19
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,220
that people call crickets are not crickets at all.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,880
They're roaches.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,580
Ooh, that's nasty.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:08,960
Crickets.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,560
They sound very similar.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,640
Yeah.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
So most of those night sounds that you hear the night insects that people listen to, they're

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,420
not crickets.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,180
They're roaches and they are the, um, the American roach, the larger ones, not the small

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,440
ones.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,860
So that noise I just played, that might be a roach, not a cricket or yeah, it sounds

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,040
more like a roach cause it has that high metallic squeal kind of sound.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,700
Oh God.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,500
Well, you know, I've lived in neighborhoods where you can actually hear them rustle in

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,020
like army formation when they go rushing away from a place I've lived in some bad places.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,600
Uh, and you can hear them in the grass and they make noise as they move through the grass.

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
I've always wondered about that if anybody else could hear it because I ask other people

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,300
about it and they don't know what I'm talking about.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,300
But I swear if they move in mass, they make noise.

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,640
Have you ever heard that?

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,980
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,660
I have a compost bin and they, and they like to take control territory of that.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,260
Okay.

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,180
Uh, and that's why I know that it's roaches and not crickets.

43
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,080
Well, like most of them, they don't discern very much of that online, but if you dig into

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
it, you'll see it's true.

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,860
See when a house burns down in a bad neighborhood though, a mass exodus occurs of roaches.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,760
Some of them possess self-preservation, so they go running in mass and you can hear them

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,880
shuffle through the grass.

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,600
It's like really weird.

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,420
Um, so, but, but that's, that's, yeah, that's something that I said I was going to bring

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,040
up a tangentially on a, on a previous sonic regarding remedies.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,380
And I said, I'll bring this up and I didn't.

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,500
So remind me, is it the better I hold off on it, the better it is for the audience, I should

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,720
say regarding roaches.

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,540
See, a long time ago, you briefly touched on that there was an entity actually in control

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
of that particular species.

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,760
And you started talking about entities being in control of certain animals or creatures.

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,980
Oh, entity.

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,260
It's always plural.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,140
It's never entity.

61
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,000
It's always plural.

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,300
Yeah.

63
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,540
Okay.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,240
Always plural.

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,540
Uh, so entities that are in control entities, bugs, animals.

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,060
Right.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,920
And, uh, so, I mean, we never really broke that wide open, so I'd love to get into that

68
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,180
too.

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,860
Well, there's only so much you can do because we're limited, you know, we filter all that

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,040
out.

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,040
Otherwise, you know, the people who don't filter it out, end up in mental institutions

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,260
because they can't cope with the others that are heavily filtering.

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,480
You see what I mean by filtering is we only see a small part of the spectrum.

74
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,120
They, they, they put this in your face.

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,620
You only see a certain part of the light spectrum.

76
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,700
You only hear a certain part of the sound spectrum, but you notice they never say you

77
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,100
actually perceive mentally, cognitively the, let's say cognitive spectrum.

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,820
They never talk about that because they don't want to just tell people that they've been

79
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,880
dumbed down, but the same thing with that.

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,460
That's why on the last Sonic, I talked about how a higher conscious can always, what was

81
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,360
the term that I use?

82
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,320
It wasn't absorb or anything that can contain a lower one, right?

83
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,720
So when you have a higher conscious person, let's say interact with the lower consciousness

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,060
one.

85
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm not saying one is better.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,839
It's the same like two cars.

87
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,800
One is mistreated and the other one's not, you know, one you put, you know, the best

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,040
fuel and you maintain it meticulously and the other one never gets maintenance and gets

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,700
the worst fuel.

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,580
They both came from the same place.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,620
They're both the same, right?

92
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,480
But eventually they degrade to higher and lower quality.

93
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,700
So like I mentioned last time, you can be of higher consciousness.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,960
You could fully contain, you could almost predict, anticipate everything the lower consciousness

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,540
will do.

96
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,160
But once you approach the lower consciousness about the higher conscious person, what do

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,760
they always say?

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,020
Man, I don't understand what he's saying.

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,540
Yeah.

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,220
I don't know.

101
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,780
Oh, he's real interesting.

102
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,040
Oh, I don't know.

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,820
You know, right.

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,520
Yeah.

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,900
That's a very simple example.

106
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,620
Well, I'll tell you another thing about that.

107
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,500
And I wonder how you interpret this.

108
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,280
But I have noticed a trend among, you know, the people that I end up having to interact

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,640
with for one reason or another, that they have defaulted to a new thing in the past couple

110
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,280
of years.

111
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,600
It seems like, and it took me a little while to figure it out, but it's sort of like, unless

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,940
you're here to tell me something I already wanted to hear, yeah, I don't acknowledge

113
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,420
you and I get hostile.

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,360
That seems new.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah.

116
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:25,640
Good.

117
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,940
Well, that's part of the culture.

118
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,180
That's part of the culture.

119
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah.

120
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,160
But it seems like a newer part.

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,660
That's the scene on TV, people.

122
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,740
Yeah.

123
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,720
But now it's social media.

124
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,060
Sorry.

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,580
Now it's, yeah, it's got to be social media because TV isn't the big influence.

126
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,960
It was, you know, say when you and I were growing up, now it's all about whatever you're

127
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,720
carrying around in your pocket, which I guess answers my own question, you know, because

128
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,640
you're determining what it is that you're being fed through your, you know, your dumb

129
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,780
phone, right?

130
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,000
Because it's supposed to be a smartphone, but it's not very smart.

131
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,420
But you are always setting the parameters by which the algorithms will feed you.

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,360
So you're deciding what you want to hear anyway.

133
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,900
And I think people are actively doing that and they get real.

134
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,160
But I'm noticing this great hostility toward anything that contradicts what they like.

135
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,380
In other words, OK, you and I decide to go do a public presentation.

136
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,100
The people that show up there, whatever their expectation was, if we don't meet it, we'll

137
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,120
be met with hostility.

138
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,860
If we meet it, exactly.

139
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,640
Even if it's really stupid and low grade and adds no value to their life, even though they

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,280
paid for a ticket and whatever, whatever.

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,140
It doesn't matter.

142
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,740
So long as we played the hits they wanted us to play, you know, well, that's used to

143
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,300
have LeBron in the crowd that he wrote about that 120 years ago.

144
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,840
It's the same people.

145
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,260
Well, look, I'm not a romantic, but I am regarding certain things that happened that created

146
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,940
a cut off.

147
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,760
In other words, everything that could have been known was known by the late 1800s.

148
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,960
And they and they decided to dumb everything down.

149
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,260
Right.

150
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,800
Right.

151
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,720
So I'm romantic about that.

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
But in terms of people are way better now than they were in the past.

153
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,060
Right.

154
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,940
They're not as dumb, actually.

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,160
But the the there's a squeeze, there's a spiritual squeeze, because they don't have a lot of

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,700
time left.

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,840
You know, in this, you know, this is what you say, culture, society, the time, right, the

158
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,220
age.

159
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,640
They don't they know that, but they can't discuss it.

160
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,260
To give you an example, OK, this is a little bit of a tangent, but there's a new film that

161
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,320
came out called Jewels.

162
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,860
It's about old people and UFO crashes.

163
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,920
One of the in Ben Kingsley, he's the actor in the backyard, destroyed his azaleas and

164
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,860
broke his birdbath.

165
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,040
And he helps the alien back, nurses the alien back, and they develop a friendship with two

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,840
other women, Jane Curtin and another woman.

167
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,700
And it shows how challenging it is to be aged, a senior citizen, how you start losing

168
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,160
your mind.

169
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,400
And I was watching this and I said, the reason why it's like that is because of the culture.

170
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,940
Older people were regarded, right, of high regard.

171
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,780
And so the culture now and also without getting into people know what I'm talking about.

172
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:16,720
But what they may not realize is the older people themselves do not have wisdom because

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,380
they never worked out how the system works.

174
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,980
Both systems, all systems, even presumptively, meaning the manmade political system, which

175
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,419
is the medical, economic, all that, and then the spiritual systems, which is above the

176
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,580
religions about themselves.

177
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,220
So they really did turn into a bunch of dummies and they're not really worth that much.

178
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,059
The older people. So this movie kind of shows the plight of the older people.

179
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,980
And it's because there are no better.

180
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,300
It's cultural. They're no better off than the young ones.

181
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,000
It's like I've said, they've stopped developing at around nine or 10 years old people.

182
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,460
Right. And then you get really old.

183
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,680
Now, if you have someone who spiritually and mentally and cognitively stops developing a

184
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,400
whole society and talking about your professionals, judges, Supreme Court judges, doctors

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,100
also, they stop developing around nine, 10, 11, 12.

186
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,880
There's only that mentality of nine, 10, 11, 12.

187
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,320
That's also the way the operating system works on smartphones, by the way, is good for a

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,780
certain active lifestyle.

189
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,220
Right. And when you get old and you lose that activity or become rigid and you're viewed

190
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,840
as no longer being part of that society, you're disposed of.

191
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:37,060
Right. So if you watch the movie called Jules, J-U-L-E-S with Ben Kingsley, you'll see

192
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,420
most people feel sorry and they, whatever, you know, for the old people, how they're

193
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,060
always mentioned in the film, how they're lonely and this and that, that has nothing to

194
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,340
do with, in other words, it's not an age old thing.

195
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,440
This is a very recent thing because the society never reaches any mature cognitive

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,520
level. And when I say, you know how I say it's the society of morons, right?

197
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm not talking about the masses.

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm talking about those that you call professionals, the masses of no effect.

199
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,660
Right. They're only as good as what they put forward.

200
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,020
Like what I mean by the society being morons, you know how the spaceship lands on the

201
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,780
front lawn, the little green Martian comes out.

202
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,660
What's the first thing they say in the film, especially the comedies?

203
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,800
Yeah, take me to your leader.

204
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,680
Right. And that's what I'm talking about, those guys who they bring them to, like

205
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,800
they're scientists, you know, regular Joe, let's say nothing as regular Joe, like

206
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,220
regular Joe. But you know what I mean?

207
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,780
An average, quote unquote, person, who average means damaged, by the way, brings

208
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,680
them to their best scientists, their best whatever, whatever, whatever, that alien's

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,080
going to look and say, these are morons.

210
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,300
What the hell am I doing here?

211
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,520
Right. That's why I've given my credo on if you're going to visit this planet, don't

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,160
talk to the humans. Anything you say is going to confuse them.

213
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,660
Right. Anything at all.

214
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,700
But anyway, back to that, the violence part.

215
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
No, I see it as being fine.

216
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,020
Look, you know, when they were talking about all the gun stuff, I was like, oh, come

217
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,040
on, gun violence.

218
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,640
That's great. Just just tell me when you want to do it.

219
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,220
I'll get under I'll go underground or behind some concrete.

220
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,000
Just everybody, just please shoot each other.

221
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,840
Please just go ahead and do it.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,760
And whoever comes out from the other side, well, those are the worthy ones.

223
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,140
Right. So, you know, all this threat and the violence, it's like the same with the

224
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,060
nukes. Drop the nukes.

225
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,620
Go ahead. Drop them. Just let me know when you're going to drop them.

226
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,480
You know, who cares?

227
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,340
You know, so it's the sort of Damocles, you know, holding a sword over people's

228
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,320
mentality, you know, like this is what we know, especially with the nukes.

229
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,000
You know, it never happened.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,920
Right. And by the way, I've explained loosely why it cannot happen.

231
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,000
Right. Because one when one goes, the EMP takes out the other one.

232
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,920
Right. So you can only do one one or two a day unless they're underground and then

233
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,320
underground. You can go every 30 minutes.

234
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,980
Right. And that's how they're going to be used, by the way, underground, not above

235
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,240
ground. Well, I shouldn't say that they are using them above ground and they're up

236
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,120
to eighth or ninth generation.

237
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,080
And most people are all vaguely familiar with first generation.

238
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,880
So, yeah.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,520
So, again, back to that with the consciousness and all that.

240
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,460
Speaking of which, this is like a puppy rate.

241
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,580
I'm doing something.

242
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,160
What am I doing? For the past 10 days, I've been eating sad food, which is standard

243
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,500
American diet. I made homemade White Castles.

244
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,340
I think I've informed you about that White Castle hamburgers.

245
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,020
Right. I've been doing turkey and roast beef sandwiches, lasagna type stuff, you

246
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,440
know, stuff that regular people eat right for about 10 days now.

247
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,820
And how do I feel? I feel like I wouldn't say I feel like crap, but I definitely don't

248
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,720
have any energy and I got an itchy spot on my ankle that's coming back.

249
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,060
Right. It sometimes if you scratch it too much, it bleeds, you know.

250
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,340
OK, so. But so now you are eating a lot of cheese, you know, some cheese, some

251
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,380
cheese, you know, because I know you said dairy was definitely kind of a, you know,

252
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,080
well, people that live on it.

253
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,520
Yeah. People that you know, what I mean, dairy is like, you know, make sure you drink

254
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
a glass of milk every day for the children.

255
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,220
That's what the depression goes up.

256
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:21,760
OK, so what I'm going to do now is I'm, in other words, aware of how I feel and what

257
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,460
manifestations I have in and out of the body.

258
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,240
OK, now I'm going to go back to a whole food diet based on energy.

259
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,240
Right. And have a change and I'll report back on specifics.

260
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,160
Now, George Asawa used to do this a lot.

261
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,860
He says you could cure anything with food.

262
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
And he did.

263
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
But he got a little extreme.

264
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,760
He went down to the East Congo and contracted some kind of several things.

265
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,840
He contracted a form of TB and an amoeba in his intestines.

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,500
And he tried to he couldn't get enough of the things that he needed.

267
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,040
You know how I put out a recipe and people can't get the ingredients.

268
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,420
Right. And he died from it.

269
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,400
So you can get pretty extreme.

270
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,840
You've heard of people testing things on themselves, right?

271
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,580
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

272
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,960
So I'm kind of this has been a test and it's been about 10 days.

273
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,220
So I'm going to go back to what I preach and teach, let's say.

274
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,800
And I have gotten some feedback regarding the rice recipe, which it's not it's not

275
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,500
to be all and all, but it is a very well balanced.

276
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,540
What it would be would be like a tune up in a pot.

277
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,800
You know, in mechanics, like WD-40 is like a tune up in a can.

278
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Right. If you have an old car, isn't running a long time.

279
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,720
You definitely need a can of WD-40 to get started on it.

280
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,480
Right. To make everything move around nice and easy.

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,540
Yeah. And give you energy in this case.

282
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,660
So the brown rice number seven or number eight, because I think it's number eight.

283
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,180
If you count the plum is a wonderful reset meal.

284
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,920
And the way I think we went on over the sonic and being redundant here, because it's

285
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,090
very important. Each ingredient has a purpose.

286
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,090
Right. And it covers a certain energy path.

287
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:13,090
And it may if you're trying to treat something, you may not want ginger right in

288
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,210
there. You may not want the burdock root.

289
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,890
But I found that the burdock root works pretty much generally across the board because we

290
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,330
are deficient. What I mean by that is, have you heard of how the farm in agriculture,

291
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,610
all of the soils have been depleted of essential minerals and things right in the past

292
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,790
hundred years. Right.

293
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:35,110
So we're not getting that nutrition in the food like selenium and forms of magnesium

294
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,230
you won't find in soils that you did a long time ago.

295
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,750
So that's where the burdock root would work well.

296
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,610
And what I'm suggesting is, yes, you must start with food because when you're trying

297
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,930
to heal something and I've had several discussions about the C word, what they call

298
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,250
cancer and just to broadcast what's going on, you know, and it's kind of harsh to tell

299
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,910
someone there's no such thing as cancer.

300
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,830
Well, yeah, it's a label.

301
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,630
Right. But it's a blockage.

302
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,610
It's a blockage that the body creates because the energies and the way the body's

303
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,990
functioning is not working.

304
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,270
It's a failsafe, actually.

305
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,650
And they've turned it into a disease or something has to be cured.

306
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,950
You'll never cure.

307
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,750
It's like saying, you know, let's eliminate roadblocks when there's a car accident.

308
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,990
Right. It's never going to happen because if you try to do that politically, the people

309
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,010
would start doing it on their own anyway.

310
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,090
The organism right of society will do it.

311
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,690
Someone will get out of their car and redirect traffic.

312
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,430
Right. Let's try and direct people around it.

313
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,550
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,870
So that's exactly what it's doing.

315
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,250
And yeah.

316
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,070
So the easiest way to do that, of course, is with food.

317
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:48,110
Why? Well, you know how they say you can go, what, 30 days without food, three days

318
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,830
without water, three and then three minutes without air or something like that.

319
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,170
Something like that. Actually, it's more like 30 minutes without air.

320
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,450
But yeah.

321
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:02,950
OK, so that's how you view your when you want to tune up or get back on track, you

322
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,990
could do it in reverse.

323
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,650
First, work on your breathing.

324
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,790
There are people that have cured and healed diseases and conditions just by learning

325
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,710
how to breathe. You know, the yoga type of there's so many types of breathing you

326
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,910
could look up. Right, right.

327
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:22,109
And then it would be water improving their water quality and then food.

328
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,089
You can actually do it in that order if, let's say, you ran into someone who was

329
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,550
very ill or low energy or whatever.

330
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,690
First thing is the breathing.

331
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,790
Second thing is the water, you know, upping the quality or doing it right.

332
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,150
And then it would be food.

333
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,250
I just wanted to throw that in there in that order.

334
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,790
And then. Sounds like up the quality of the primary things that you need to survive in

335
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,950
the order of priority based on time.

336
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,310
Yeah. Because you're breathing water and food.

337
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,150
Yes. Yes.

338
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,450
And thought, of course, you know, when people are stressed, they have a physical

339
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,970
reaction. Let's say you're hungry.

340
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,810
You go to a place, you look forward to eat with someone you like and you get some

341
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,730
really bad news.

342
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,650
What happens? Lose your appetite completely.

343
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,870
Yeah. So there is a physical effect of the mind.

344
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,690
That's and vice versa.

345
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,590
If you get extremely happy, you also lose your appetite.

346
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,530
Right. So it's these extremes that I'm talking about.

347
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,390
Well, I don't know. Sometimes I get into a celebratory mood and I want to eat.

348
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,730
I have a desire to eat certain things when I'm in a celebratory mood.

349
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,670
Well, that's celebratory, but an immediate impulse from really good news, let's say.

350
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,750
Oh, OK. Well, that's like snorting something up your nose.

351
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,930
Actually, that's what that does.

352
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,930
But yeah, so that's a long way from where we started.

353
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,830
But that's that was very important to bring out that order.

354
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,870
I have not done that. Fair enough.

355
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,630
You know, there's another factor here, which I want to bring up.

356
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,450
Have you ever heard of the Rashomon effect?

357
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,630
They say that again. Rashomon effect.

358
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,630
They call it. OK, I'll describe it for you.

359
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,010
This is the Wikipedia description, which is fairly concise, although Wikipedia is

360
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,830
definitely everything for idiots.

361
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,450
But you got to use it if it's concise.

362
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,890
OK, it's it's intelligence agencies.

363
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,570
They rush. OK, I just typed it in.

364
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,510
I just got into the case.

365
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,830
There's a storytelling and writing method in cinema, which the event is given

366
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,130
contradictory interpretations or descriptions.

367
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,310
Right now, this can be expanded into a wider

368
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,850
understanding of the way people interpret things.

369
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,590
OK. And the effect is named after Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon, in which a

370
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,970
murderer is described in four contradictory ways by four eyewitnesses.

371
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,170
The term addresses the motives, mechanism and accuracies of the reporting on the

372
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,810
circumstance. And OK, so you get the point here is like civil wars and revolutions

373
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,770
are based on also kind of thing.

374
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,830
Well, the thing is, though, OK, from a certain perspective.

375
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,130
Right. Somebody is either a tyrant or they are the victor in a righteous battle.

376
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,350
Right. Depending on which side you stand on.

377
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,390
But people interpret everything according to their perspective.

378
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,810
And this sometimes changes exactly how they describe it.

379
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,450
And I find this interesting.

380
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,790
And that's why I brought up the whole thing about, you know, people want to hear what

381
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,150
they want to hear and that's it anymore.

382
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:21,270
It's an oversimplified version of this where you can interpret anything and describe it

383
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,170
in a different way. And I mean, I'm just encountering this constantly.

384
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,870
And no, no, no.

385
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,010
It's not about you, though.

386
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:34,570
Is it is it something that, in other words, is so deeply implanted in the society and the

387
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,030
culture that needs to either you need to change what you do to go around it or ignore

388
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,470
it? You see, that's the main thing that I like to talk.

389
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,210
That's the ultimate question I have.

390
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,290
Exactly. That is, what do you do with this?

391
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:54,030
If you are being objective and, you know, viewing things as objectively as possible.

392
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,010
Well, does it affect your food, clothing and shelter and happiness in any way?

393
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,490
Well, if you have to interact with people, it does.

394
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,530
Well, it's all about how you interact with them.

395
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,690
Yeah. Right.

396
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,330
So, in other words, what interest do you have?

397
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,330
Right. It's your interest.

398
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,870
You know, like that's a major thing.

399
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,850
You know, have you ever heard like politically, you know, we went and attacked Libya because it

400
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,070
has the United States has interest in it.

401
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,950
And that's good enough. Right.

402
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,630
So you have the broad the broad aspect to things like that.

403
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,190
You know, you can have a broad put it this way.

404
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,730
When I go out into society, people know I have a broad aspect like that.

405
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,530
I want nothing to do with anything that's going on.

406
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,050
I'm just here for this. Right.

407
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,390
You see. Yeah.

408
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:44,550
OK, I just I brought it up because I just thought it was interesting because this thing

409
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,150
about the inner voice again has come up.

410
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,750
Right. And as I said, I I'm hearing about it because it is most interesting to people

411
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,870
that, you know, to consider where that's actually coming from.

412
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,430
What is the issue with it?

413
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,850
What is the problem with it?

414
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,250
What is the danger of it?

415
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,070
If you're getting well, you're getting your cues, you're getting your inner voice from not

416
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,410
you. Well, you do the JFK research.

417
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,130
You're never going to find out the front end of it.

418
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,150
You're only going to write what was front loaded to it, to only to a certain degree.

419
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,330
Right. The same thing.

420
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,870
It's kind of 9-11 is really good.

421
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,550
It's positively, definitely without any doubt that was an atomic, you know, actually was

422
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,770
thermonuclear demolition.

423
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,090
There's no doubt about that.

424
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,470
Right. And most people have a psychological hard time.

425
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,570
I actually found the trace of how the Department of Energy gave the OK.

426
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,730
Right. And said they hold the triggers of the devices.

427
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,050
Right. It's kind of like you have a gun.

428
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,910
Someone has guns, but they have no bullets.

429
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,490
Right. OK. Well, no triggers on the guns.

430
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,250
The DOE holds all the triggers for all the civilian nuclear devices and most of the

431
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,990
military ones. So when one's ready to go hot, they deliver the trigger and they use

432
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,350
the OST, which is the Office of Special Transportation.

433
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,130
It's a branch of the Secret Service.

434
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,290
Right. And FEMA arranged all that.

435
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,790
Right. And you've always heard how FEMA was there two days before.

436
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:22,330
But there's more to it and also found one of the the lower OST operatives.

437
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,710
Right. All this other stuff.

438
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,350
Right. So wait a second.

439
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:34,470
Why is the DOE delivering trigger mechanisms to New York via the OST?

440
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:43,890
Oh, to somehow thwart planes crashing into the building and a diesel fire that caused its

441
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,970
collapse. That's right.

442
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,210
That's right. GP8 or G8, whatever the fuel is.

443
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:55,910
You see. And also the NNSA, if you look at every photograph of high resolution post

444
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,450
demolition of the World Trade Center, you go to the bottom of the photograph.

445
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,550
Credits go to U.S.

446
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,730
government and then parentheses.

447
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,350
It's NNSA.

448
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,330
Well, what's the NNSA?

449
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,230
The National Nuclear Safety Administration.

450
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,490
Oh, the reason why the National Nuclear Safety Administration took all those photos is, of

451
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,870
course, they were set up to manage, you know, jet fuel disasters, of course.

452
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,250
Right. OK, so why did I say this?

453
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,190
How contrary of what I said is to what the people believe happened on 9-11.

454
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,730
Of course, they say 50 percent of the people don't believe in what they've been told.

455
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,030
But where are they going to go?

456
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,690
Space weapons, dynamite on each floor.

457
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,410
Right. It was rigged for explosives.

458
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,170
They saw the plumes coming out of each.

459
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,470
Right. They're never going to go to the nuclear thing.

460
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,070
Right. Never, ever.

461
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,010
But here's the thing.

462
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,650
Is it so important?

463
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,250
How far? We're never going to find out more than that, I think, because no one's come

464
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,290
forward. There was over a thousand operatives, American operatives, involved in

465
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,290
pulling it off. And how many have come forward?

466
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,830
Very fewer than those that were involved in JFK.

467
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,750
I don't think anyone ever involved in the JFK come forward either.

468
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,410
Is there? Well, they may have because they may have anonymously.

469
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,230
Well, not even necessarily anonymously, but mixed in with a whole bunch of false

470
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,930
you know, a whole bunch of distracted people searching their own 15 minutes of fame,

471
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,650
this kind of stuff. And if you mix it all together, well, you know, you could have

472
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,510
legitimate people that come out and they're just, you know, all caught up and they all

473
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,010
come out seemingly at the same time and they all get grouped into.

474
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,450
Well, these are just, you know, nuts that are seeking to write a good story.

475
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:45,270
But with either JFK or 9-11, first thing is what the authorities are telling you is

476
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,310
absolutely impossible.

477
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,370
Can't happen that way.

478
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,330
That's the first problem.

479
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,890
Yeah. What's the first?

480
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,610
And then the second thing is we know how it was done.

481
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,390
Like with JFK, it's not one magic bullet.

482
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,330
It was at least three, right?

483
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,530
Maybe five or four were fired to definitely make contact, maybe three.

484
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,990
Right. Right. Oh, yeah.

485
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,870
OK, not one.

486
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,890
OK, so 9-11, it's the same thing.

487
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,950
It wasn't jet fuel.

488
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,190
It was definitely something that shook the ground and the towers collapsed and the steel

489
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,230
vaporized is only one thing that could do that.

490
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,790
Right. But the people can't believe that.

491
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,550
Now, there are people in the military, by the way, that know of atomic gates.

492
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,830
And I've spoken to people in the nuclear industry, in military, that I said, you know

493
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,930
what atomic gate is? And they're like, no, never heard of it.

494
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,850
I said, oh, my gosh.

495
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,630
You know, I think I've gone over this real quick.

496
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,770
If every country plans for the worst, I'd hope it never happens.

497
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,090
Right. So do you think there's a plan of a contingency plan?

498
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:49,790
If the US contingent states and Alaska was ever, ever suffered a successful ground

499
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,870
invasion, do you think they have a plan for that?

500
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,850
A contingency plan?

501
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,410
Yes, there is. Yes, they do.

502
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,090
Yes. So. OK, so what do I mean by that?

503
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:03,650
Ships showing up, planes dropping people from, you know, parachutes, air droplets, sea

504
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,790
land and sea. Right.

505
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,290
Invasion. Right.

506
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,550
Like a D-Day type thing.

507
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,370
Oh, yeah. There are plans to retake New Jersey in case a hostile enemy force decided to

508
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,750
occupy it. There are plans for boots on the ground.

509
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,010
OK, so so here's the contingency to make it short.

510
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,450
I just wanted to give a little more detail on people.

511
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,010
What do you mean? OK, that's what I mean.

512
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,790
Like boots on the ground, you know, whatever.

513
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:30,770
Coming here and taking over at gunpoint and heavy artillery and ordnance of every kind.

514
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,190
Red Dawn on to anything you can imagine.

515
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,450
They have contingency plans.

516
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,430
Yes, exactly. OK, so here's one of the called an atomic.

517
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,850
Do you think they're going to leave the Golden Gate Bridge, the Verrazano Bridge, the

518
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,950
Brooklyn Bridge, those big buildings up the they're going to leave the power stations

519
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,910
running for the enemy to take and use?

520
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,590
No, I see what you're talking about is what I think of as destroying the infrastructure

521
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,970
so that it can't be inherited by an invader.

522
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,190
OK, got exactly.

523
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,430
Main bridges. Yeah.

524
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,530
You think they're going to leave the Golden Gate Bridge up so they could cross, have a

525
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,670
nice crossing for their for their tanks and stuff?

526
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,790
No, no. Just like they're not going to leave the power grid intact either.

527
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,330
That's not going to happen if there is an invasion.

528
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,670
Why give it to the enemy who can just, oh, I'm going to take this over.

529
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,310
It's perfectly. You think while the invasion is happening or before, they're going to get

530
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:22,810
about 30 or 40 thousand people to wire up about four million tons of TNT to do all those

531
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,830
things? Or do they already have small nuclear devices that, you know, disintegrate

532
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,370
anything right underground?

533
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,070
The more intelligent thing would be to have it already sitting there waiting just to be

534
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,070
utilized in case.

535
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,590
Exactly. Yeah. So all these things, all these major buildings and major parts of

536
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,610
infrastructure have what's called an atomic gate.

537
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,590
There's a section of it.

538
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,110
Now, you know, they say you don't want to if you if you have a dead body in your house,

539
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,150
you got to get rid of it because you don't want your mom to find it in the freezer.

540
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,970
Right. So when you have maintenance people that maintain these skyscrapers and big

541
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,690
buildings, you don't want them to find the device.

542
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,070
So it's never actually in those locations.

543
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,630
It's nearby. And there's a small access tunnel right to it.

544
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,230
That would make sense. That's how the World Trade Center was done.

545
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,410
You know, that's why they took down Building 7.

546
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,570
Building 7 was the control center.

547
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,490
There's international symbols for that.

548
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,130
Also, if you know which where these devices are, we can get into that another time.

549
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,170
So they use atomic. So there in other words, there are thousands of atomic and nuclear

550
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,510
thermonuclear. There is a difference between atomic and thermonuclear, by the way, already

551
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:37,430
in place within hours and several hours or a day or so are activated to take down the

552
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,130
infrastructure. So the invading land force doesn't use it.

553
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,430
By the way, this whole contingency has been in place since the time of ancient times, by

554
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,590
the way. Right. So, yeah.

555
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,390
So, yeah. And there's people in military never heard of this or don't know.

556
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,630
It's like, oh, my gosh. So what is that compartmentalization?

557
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,410
OK, so we've gone off quite a bit on a tangent.

558
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,850
But the whole thing is any situation that you see that may not be favorable for the

559
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,370
collective. Two things.

560
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,610
One, you avoid it or see how you could use it as an opportunist.

561
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,010
Right. If you can be and without going into the black market necessarily.

562
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,230
Right. And doing things that are unlawful.

563
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,310
OK, give you an example.

564
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,190
Real simple example is the alternative media.

565
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,730
Right. The mainstream media is doing such a great job that there has to be an

566
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,710
alternative media to counter and tell people, quote unquote, the truth.

567
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,650
No, it's not because they're doing it's because they're so shitty.

568
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,390
There's a alternative media.

569
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,550
Right. And there's always been an alternative media.

570
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:45,930
I remember years ago looking around for old periodicals because you'll find more, you

571
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:51,330
know, old books already been targeted and periodicals get spread out more than books

572
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,310
sometimes and find catalog.

573
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:01,650
There was a lot of anti-Catholic magazines in the 1700s warning people, do not let the

574
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,530
Catholic Church here.

575
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,410
You will be you will suffer the same thing that you suffered in Europe.

576
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,470
That's right. Remember why you came here.

577
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,110
Right. Right. So what did they do?

578
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,430
They let the Catholic Church in.

579
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,910
But they did have quite a push against it.

580
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,010
You see, but you won't find too many books on that.

581
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,190
You'll find periodicals.

582
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,310
Right. So now you have like Nexus magazine.

583
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,050
Right. And all these other now it's an Internet alternative media.

584
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,550
Unfortunately, before the digital, there was plenty of underground newspapers and zines

585
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,190
and magazines and independent publications.

586
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,890
Allegedly, that was sort of the alternative media of that day.

587
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,710
If you knew where to get those limited printed printings on this and that and the third

588
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,290
thing. And it was remarkable how much information might be in their alternative

589
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,010
information. And then later, shortwave radio and things like that.

590
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,510
Sure. So that will.

591
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,290
So anything you bring up that says something in society, you're always going to see a

592
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,690
counter movement against it.

593
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,810
But the only problem that I see with that, whether it's the thing that you mentioned, that

594
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:10,370
effect or whatever, is that when certain people decide to take that path to provide an

595
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,930
alternate source of information in this case, where do they come from?

596
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,590
Where is their education from?

597
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,450
The same group that is subject to it.

598
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,370
So they're not going to it's very rare.

599
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,450
You're going to have a clear answer.

600
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,170
You can example is in the medical.

601
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,350
I've been on many conference calls and seen many videos that people have sent about an

602
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,410
alternative doctor and they said they have this herbal concoction they made that will

603
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,550
lower your blood pressure.

604
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,650
Oh, my God. Or help you with diabetes.

605
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:38,910
Oh, my God.

606
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,390
Oh, what? What?

607
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,110
What? Fictional diseases.

608
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,330
Right. So why?

609
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,770
Because they have the standard education.

610
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:54,350
Right. So you almost I once commented on a video that someone spoke on a few months ago

611
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,190
and never got posted. They didn't allow it to be posted.

612
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,710
People are looking for the truth.

613
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,250
It's not just somebody that's going to come and give them the truth and it's all said and

614
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,430
done. The best they're going to get is one person starts peeling back.

615
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,110
There are many layers. So like an onion.

616
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,310
Right. Or it's not really like an onion because onion are thin layers.

617
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,690
You know how the most of the layers on the onion are very even.

618
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,390
This is very different.

619
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,130
Like the first layer could be 10 feet thick and the second layer could be only a half an

620
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,910
inch thick. Right.

621
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,010
It's not it's not consistent.

622
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,270
What the best information people are going to get is by peeling back multiple layers.

623
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,070
But the problem is when they peel all the layers of misinformation and deception away,

624
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:40,630
when they get to what's the truth because of their previous teachings and background, they

625
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,730
will not recognize it.

626
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,030
They'll just walk right over it.

627
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,750
And they'll notice or they'll notice it's been in front of them the whole time.

628
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,910
That's one of the slogans of Greek speak, discovering the obvious.

629
00:33:53,650 --> 00:34:00,350
You see. So, again, with all these things in society, if I'm always saying we're better, way

630
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,230
better off today than we were a hundred or two hundred thousand years ago, way better off.

631
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,630
Right. Because to me, it just shows you there's another inherent problem which goes back to

632
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,489
the inner voice.

633
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,510
The inner voice doesn't necessarily have to be OK.

634
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,770
The inner voice entities were here before us.

635
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,969
Right. So they're playing with us because that's their realm.

636
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,650
And you can take them as a teacher.

637
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,510
You can take them as a hindrance.

638
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,530
You can take them as a help.

639
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,010
You can take them as a hindrance.

640
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,590
Right. You could see them as a friend.

641
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,949
You can see them as an entity.

642
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,469
I mean, an enemy.

643
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,670
You can take them as a form of God.

644
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,070
Right. You can take them.

645
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,290
Right. It's all a matter of how you structure what you're doing.

646
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:52,889
But no matter what they do to you, you're going to be OK if you start to understand the

647
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,050
situation. Right.

648
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,630
Meaning that, you know, what much like you were talking about information streams, much

649
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,430
like the argument I make all the time of like, no, do pay attention to the guys who are

650
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:10,110
giving you the misinformation, because if you're aware that they are misinformed, then

651
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,650
now you know exactly what is BS, because you can call it.

652
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,550
It's like, I know that this guy only provides the best BS.

653
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,130
Yeah. Watch. Listen to that.

654
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,030
Pay careful attention.

655
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,990
Yeah. It has a structure to it.

656
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,350
So once you recognize the structure, you're.

657
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,230
Yeah. Then you can utilize it for your own purposes.

658
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,730
So that makes perfect sense to me.

659
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,110
Is that OK? So the inner voice could teach you a great deal about what's not you.

660
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,550
It depends on the structure.

661
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,730
Like we've mentioned, we've gone into great length on how you develop.

662
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,990
They change the they change the inner voice.

663
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,790
Right. And if you get to a certain level where your consciousness is high and your

664
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:53,010
knowledge base is high, the those on the other side that provide the inner voice are

665
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,530
fewer and fewer to provide it.

666
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,810
So they start bringing in bigger bad asses.

667
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,690
Right. And if you get really advanced, they start giving you anticipated moves and you

668
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,910
think you can tell the future.

669
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,690
But they're actually giving it to you.

670
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,650
Right. OK, because they're just you know, it's a very efficient way to throw you off

671
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,310
because once you find out about the inner voice, now it's like we can't be so obvious

672
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,110
anymore. Right.

673
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:23,310
We have to distract them a little bit by let's say he'll be able to see a minute into

674
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,610
the future pretty much half the time and he'll get so impressed by that he'll forget

675
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,750
that it's us doing it.

676
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,130
Well, very much like there used to be a lag in news.

677
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,790
Right. You could do something on the other side of the world and nobody would hear about

678
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,430
it for a few days. You knew you had a few days to control the spin, to put out a story

679
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,330
before people found out about it up until a few years ago.

680
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,630
Now, instantaneous information travels.

681
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,010
So well, and even more, they anticipate they give you what's called the predictive

682
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,830
program. They'll tell you what's good.

683
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,410
Right. Yeah. That's where I was going next, is that now now they get ahead of it.

684
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,450
Now let's put out the predictive programming because they're going to find out about the

685
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,350
event immediately.

686
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,270
So but like I said, again, going back to, you know, around the time you and I are growing

687
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,650
up again, it took a few days for things to travel even from state to state.

688
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,770
It would take you're in New York.

689
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,470
OK, something happens in Ohio.

690
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,190
You didn't hear about it that day unless you had a friend in Ohio that called you up on a

691
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,330
phone and said, hey, did you hear about this?

692
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,410
Well, there were some actually news channels that ran 24 seven that you would get it

693
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,230
through the API or the UPI Associated Press.

694
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,710
Yeah. Or the or the United Press.

695
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,090
The two they would do a hot sheet.

696
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,310
Right. They get it. The radio station would get a telex or a fax or something.

697
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,890
Right. But it wasn't it.

698
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,810
But it wasn't as commonly accessible.

699
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,990
So you didn't have as much of it like, you know, cell phones with cameras and posting

700
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,510
it two minutes ago on YouTube.

701
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,990
Right. Right. Exactly.

702
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,590
That's my point. Right.

703
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,530
By the way, that's still under control.

704
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,890
If you added a legitimate UFO land in front of your house and shot a video and put it

705
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,470
up on YouTube and you actually made the post and you go back and view the video, it'll

706
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,110
look very different from what you put up.

707
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,590
There's there's fail safes on that already.

708
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,170
That's you know how they're telling with the A.I.

709
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,350
They can do it. They could screen every pixel and know what it should be put up and

710
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,090
not, you know. Oh, yeah.

711
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,970
No, it only takes a couple of minutes for all that stuff to be filtered real fast.

712
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,790
At most, you know, so your your video of that legitimate UFO might exist there for

713
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,670
about two, three minutes and then boom, you might be able to see it, but no one else

714
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,070
will. Yeah, because through your IP, right, it'll be blurry.

715
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,290
It'll look fake, you know.

716
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,470
Right. Or it'll be cut up or whatever.

717
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,630
Yeah. It's it's fine.

718
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,930
But so still much better off or you'll end up with sound and no picture.

719
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,290
There's many ways to do it.

720
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,590
Actually, they're sophisticated enough to actually put something else there.

721
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,790
Yeah, that's similar.

722
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,330
Sometimes that's all ready to go.

723
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,970
Look at 9-11 when they put the airplanes in.

724
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,610
You know, there was a few black frames.

725
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,850
If you look at the recording with CNN, we're showing the plane going in as soon as

726
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,210
they switched over this black frame, black frame, black frame, three or four black

727
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,850
frames or 16 frames per second.

728
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,850
So for a quarter of a second, it was black.

729
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,370
Then there's no background of Jersey anymore.

730
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,890
The sky is different. And then you see the plane go in.

731
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,110
Right. There's no because right before the plane, you could see the Jersey shore.

732
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,590
Right. The Hudson.

733
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,590
And it was a blue sky, no clouds.

734
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,410
But when they put they switched over to the plane, you don't see the Jersey shore

735
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,210
anymore. Same shot, same angle.

736
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,710
Right. And the sky is like a whitish blue kind of featureless.

737
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,710
Yeah. So and that was I think what's her name?

738
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,150
Victoria Roth. Was it Rebecca Roth?

739
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,150
Rebecca Roth. She did some pretty good research on that.

740
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,630
The young guys that did the CGI effects for that.

741
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,230
They were pretty much they exploded into doing no pun intended there, into doing

742
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,550
the the promotions you see on lines of scrimmage at baseball games.

743
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,370
You know, when you're watching it on TV, you'll see an ad behind the play.

744
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,090
But if you're sitting in the stands, you don't see it.

745
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,550
You know, the CGI effects that you see in sports games.

746
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,570
They were given that contract to reward them.

747
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,430
I think that was a really good piece of it.

748
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,510
They didn't say that they did, but she followed the group around and notice how

749
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,430
they were interesting on that.

750
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,410
It's very, very pertinent, by the way.

751
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,750
I like to give 9-11 references because the biblical stories are also pertinent, like

752
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,790
9-11. Right. How radical this what people think happened compared to what is

753
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,850
memorialized. Right.

754
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,990
So, yeah, there's many levels.

755
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,570
One more thing before we go.

756
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,950
What I bring. I think I've mentioned this with you before about vacations.

757
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,510
There's a certain mentality, you know, behind vacations.

758
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,390
You know, I understand.

759
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,150
OK, people have careers.

760
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,350
They work on a schedule.

761
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,850
They get what? Two weeks off or whatever.

762
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,010
They get sick days. You know, the typical corporate structure.

763
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,970
Sure. Right. They offer certain.

764
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,230
Yeah. Depends on who you work with or for.

765
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,570
I've had a job or two like that.

766
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,810
I think I told you before I worked for Exxon for a bit.

767
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,310
So, yeah, I had that sort of thing.

768
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,250
Yeah. Yeah. So it's structured, very structured.

769
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,770
OK, I get the structured part.

770
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,970
But the part where your people are looking forward to go on vacation, I've

771
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,530
experienced this to get away from everything.

772
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,890
Right. So they're there.

773
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,770
They have like, oh, you know, close up the house or wherever you live.

774
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,470
We're going to be away for a week, let's say.

775
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:30,090
Real simple. And they're always unplug a bunch of unnecessary things, you know,

776
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,110
shut off the service.

777
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,390
And during the vacation, they're wondering, you know, did I unplug this or

778
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,530
whatever. Right. And how much money they're spending or whatever, you know,

779
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,210
whatever, whatever. And then it's like they're so happy to go back home.

780
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,070
Ninety nine percent of the time.

781
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,650
Oh, we're going home. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

782
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,970
Well, if you're so happy to go home and you're thinking about home while you're

783
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,310
on vacation, why are you going on vacation anyway?

784
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,610
Again, it's the cultural thing.

785
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,170
That's the programming, right?

786
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,450
I think I never participated in that, though.

787
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,050
I got to be honest.

788
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,950
But there are a lot of people that do.

789
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,110
When I got time off from work, for me, it was like that means I don't have to go

790
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,570
anywhere. I can just, you know, stay in the house.

791
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,410
Well, here's the thing, because recently someone I know, some a couple, let's say,

792
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,790
and they're like standard, you know, conventional collective people and they're

793
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,790
going scuba diving somewhere in the Caribbean or Costa Rica or something.

794
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,630
And I kind of chuckled when I heard that they're away doing that, because I'm

795
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,090
like, first of all, what are these people offering to society?

796
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,050
What do they do? What do they think about?

797
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,110
I know how they are. And it sounds critical and judgmental, but it's like, you

798
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,730
know, they believe, you know, what they see on mainstream.

799
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,230
They believe what the doctor knows about the human body.

800
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,550
They believe they have to pay tax, their taxes.

801
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:50,230
They believe. And they're going on a vacation, scuba diving, elaborate vacation,

802
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:54,710
all that. And I'm thinking about all the energy to do that while they're there.

803
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,230
Yeah, I wish them a good time and all that.

804
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,470
But I have to chuckle.

805
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:04,990
I have to chuckle. So in order to do that right in good consciousness, you have to

806
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,570
imagine like, OK, all the water you're drinking is good.

807
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,290
You've done everything you could to make your life better or whatever.

808
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,930
They never think of stuff like that.

809
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,430
They just do. I've had people tell me we're conventional.

810
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,670
We're mainstream. We do what everybody else does.

811
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,130
Right. Yeah. And and part of that useless existence, to me, it's completely

812
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,770
useless, is the vacation thing that they enjoy.

813
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,630
Right. I would I would never do that.

814
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,730
It's like you should you know, there's an old saying, make your vocation your

815
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,890
vacation. Right. In other words, you should always do what you like.

816
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,510
I never understood that.

817
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,830
And it's funny when I because I don't socialize much and get into the mainstream

818
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,510
stuff when I hear about someone doing that.

819
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,190
I'm like, that is so funny.

820
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,530
That is so funny because, you know, the thing is, first of all, they're going on

821
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,130
vacation, enjoy themselves and like so many better things to do to improve your

822
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,030
life. But on the same time, aren't they always on vacation here anyway?

823
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:02,650
I mean, it's kind of an interesting thing to look at, you know, in other words,

824
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,410
the conventional collective people going on vacation.

825
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,710
That is so funny because I've been around them when they do it.

826
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:13,530
Right. The whole thing is, is just it's it's here.

827
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:18,030
Here's another way to look at if you want to know someone, let's say you just meet

828
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,030
someone or you're socializing with some you want to know a little bit more about

829
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,570
them. This is easy to do now, especially and I came up with this after the digital

830
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,570
media, because with cameras where you had to develop film and you had to develop

831
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,230
film. Right. You take the rollout, send it away.

832
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,490
You know, it's not an immediate event.

833
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,970
Right. Well, recently with the phones recently past 10 years, at least you want

834
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:46,270
to learn more about someone that you're acquainted with or whatever, just to do a

835
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,570
test. And this is the test.

836
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,270
Tell them to take a picture of something like a meal or an object, take a picture

837
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,570
of it and show it and then look at the picture that they took.

838
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,790
That tells you a lot about the person when someone takes a photograph.

839
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,330
Should you should you pick the thing or let them pick the thing?

840
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,050
You can pick the thing. OK, it probably be better.

841
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,710
Right. Or you pick, let's say, take a couple of pictures, but one of them is one

842
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,770
that you picked would be good. OK, and then let them show you the photo.

843
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,610
And that will tell you a lot about the character of the person.

844
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,590
Why? Because when you're taking a photo, you're memorializing an image that should

845
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,510
just be a form of communication to someone viewing it.

846
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,350
Right. It's not just the image itself.

847
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,750
We're not doing modern art here.

848
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,950
Right. And when this is not self-expression type modern art.

849
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:41,070
What I mean by this is you'll learn a lot about the person if they're selfish, if

850
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,090
they can see, if they can perceive or if they can communicate.

851
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:49,110
Like, for example, when someone takes a photograph and they show you the

852
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,730
photograph, you'll notice like the angle, the lighting, the position or whatever

853
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,070
just shows the object out of context mostly.

854
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,930
And you don't really know what it is.

855
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,950
OK, that is the type of person that is more on the selfish side or whatever,

856
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,770
because they're there.

857
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,150
They're taking a photo of the object.

858
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,210
Right. And they know what the object is.

859
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,210
They're walking. You know, they're in 3D motion.

860
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,170
Right. And they see the setting that it's in and they get to see it from various

861
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,030
angles. Even if you don't move, you could just move your head a little bit and you

862
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,030
get more of an angle.

863
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,650
When they take the photo and it doesn't seem it seems out of context or it's out

864
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,650
of scale or whatever.

865
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,450
See, they know that they're there and they can see it.

866
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,850
And but the photo doesn't really show it very well.

867
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,010
It's like, well, I don't care.

868
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,490
I see it. If you don't, that's your problem.

869
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,790
It's just, you know, a bad photo.

870
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:46,410
Right. So someone who is a who is considerate will make will take the photo in a

871
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,030
way that will give more than just what the object is.

872
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,810
It will show a sense of scale, a sense of perspective.

873
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:58,850
Right. And so it's like you're when when you're in the situation and you're asked

874
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:04,250
to communicate something in a photograph, you need to make it so someone who is not

875
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:09,190
there sees the photograph and gets the maximum effect or the maximum amount of

876
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,270
information from it.

877
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,730
Right. So a simple example would be too close.

878
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,850
Yeah. Only from above.

879
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,530
Let's say it depends. It depends on the situation.

880
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,810
But actually watching how people and what people do in photographs tells you a lot

881
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,050
about them, how considerate they are to others, if they can actually see.

882
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,250
If they can actually see and if they can communicate and they're interested in

883
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,290
communicating. And I've been doing this for a long time, and it works really, really

884
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,370
well. Yeah, I got a question about that.

885
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,810
Just another little qualifier here, because I look I've exchanged a lot of images

886
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,870
with you over the years.

887
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,450
And clearly, anybody who knows me knows I got a bit of a visual problem.

888
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:55,970
So I'm thinking that probably skews what it is that I put into photographs when I'm

889
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,330
trying to communicate with a photograph.

890
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,670
But I think also I've communicated this is this is a high level, though.

891
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,030
It's very it's subtle.

892
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:04,990
OK, it's subtle.

893
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,370
Well, I was just curious, but it's less subtle as time goes on, because most people

894
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:14,550
have taken if you have the stupid rectangle, it's actually not even a phone.

895
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,810
You know, it's a camera that happens to be a phone.

896
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:22,230
If you look at the level of technology and the focus and the emphasis on the device,

897
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,950
it's for media, not for speaking on the phone.

898
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,010
There's way more. There's way more put into the you know, there's two different

899
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,290
cameras. You got a front and a back camera now on all of this.

900
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,710
So as it develops and keeps going, when you look at photographs, it's the how the

901
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,050
person perceives themselves when they're communicating and engaging with others.

902
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,770
It's an interesting one.

903
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,490
And I've also got, you know, a job application.

904
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:57,130
Right. It's actually whenever whenever I was in a situation where I needed to have

905
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,950
people work with me, let's say hire people.

906
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,550
Typically, if you were to do that, let's say most people on the receiving end of

907
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,670
that. But if you're on the opposite end, let's say, you know, like George Bush W.

908
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,150
Bush Jr. said, the French are not good at business because they don't have a word for

909
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,230
entrepreneur. Right.

910
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,710
Yeah. Well, if you're an entrepreneurial industrialist type, eventually, as you

911
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:26,010
start needing help, you're going to put an ad out or ask for people to come.

912
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,590
Right. Right. And so you could screen them, interview them, quote unquote, job

913
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,850
application. Give you an example.

914
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,550
What I did with several businesses.

915
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:38,530
How would you do that? How is it typically done?

916
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,790
You show up, you give you a piece of paper, you write your history, your school and

917
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,030
all that, your past experience, and they ask you a bunch of questions and then they

918
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:51,470
kind of wonder and scratch their head, you know, you know, he smelled didn't smell

919
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,390
good. I don't think I want to hire him or whatever.

920
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,830
And there's just what they wrote down on a stupid piece of paper.

921
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,650
And then you're going to see if they work out there on what do you call it when you're

922
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,090
on probation for 30 days or something?

923
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,570
What do they call it? Or they're going to try you out.

924
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,970
Right. You're there for a trial.

925
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,030
Total bullshit. That's total mainstream garbage.

926
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,650
I'll tell you how the Greek did it or would do it and does it.

927
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,890
OK. Have I ever gone over this?

928
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,450
No, I don't think so. Things are a little different nowadays, though, from the old paper

929
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,510
application, you know.

930
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,470
Oh, yeah. This has nothing to do with it.

931
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,390
Yeah. Because now it is. That's total garbage.

932
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,570
This is in line.

933
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:30,090
Asking someone to take a photograph is more subtle.

934
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,190
I'm going to give you something that is less subtle, but works on the same subtle

935
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,810
energy. OK. And you'll learn you'll know more about the person that they know about

936
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,630
themselves. And OK.

937
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,930
What I do is I have a small table or an area set aside

938
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,970
with a big pile of coins.

939
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,990
So it would be copper pennies, dimes, nickels, quarters.

940
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,850
Big pile would be, you know, a few pounds.

941
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,210
Right. Then I have twenty, thirty dollars worth of coins.

942
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,650
Yeah, at least.

943
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:02,410
And then in front of them, I have a jar for the pennies, a jar for the nickel, a jar

944
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,330
for the dime and a jar for the quarter.

945
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,050
There are four jars there.

946
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,530
And I ask them to separate the coins.

947
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,410
And one says pennies, dimes, nickel.

948
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,830
All right. All right. They're all labeled.

949
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,850
Watching them separate those coins will tell you more about them than if they worked

950
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,690
free with with you for a year.

951
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,030
I'll tell you more about how they are when they're not at work.

952
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,410
How's that? Well, first of all, the coins are the job

953
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,030
is for what money.

954
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,710
Right. What's the first thing your grandma, your uncle, your mom and dad gave you when

955
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,190
you're four years old? You wanted some money.

956
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,870
They hand you a hundred dollar bill where they give you some what coins give you some

957
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,170
coins. So it's the first thing that you engage in.

958
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,890
You actually probably got a coin.

959
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,630
The first thing getting a job is a commercial venture, commercial interaction

960
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:51,610
before you went on your first commercial interaction as a child, no matter how old

961
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,630
or how young you were. I assure you, you got coins first.

962
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:59,750
Right. Right. If you are five years old and you have the freedom or six or seven, you

963
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,630
anticipate going buying a piece of candy.

964
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,090
You're not going to just go in there and say, well, you're going to anticipate you have

965
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,170
to get some coinage first.

966
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,910
So, OK, first interaction in commerce.

967
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,050
It's coin, so you're very familiar with them, they're very common.

968
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,770
Also, the coins are distinctively separate.

969
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,170
Now, the first thing here is the thing I've had people come in and sit down, this is

970
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,890
what you want me to do. I don't want to do this.

971
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,130
This is beneath me by great.

972
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,270
So now you have a serious narcissistic ego problem with somebody.

973
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,410
Right. I have an engineering degree.

974
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,210
You can have me sort coins on a job interview.

975
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,970
That's bullshit. All right.

976
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:42,950
Bye. You just learned more from that person that they may look great on paper.

977
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,510
Right. But there'll be a real shithead if you work with them.

978
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,930
You see right away. Right.

979
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,850
OK, here's another one. Sorting out the coins, not only.

980
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,370
Well, three of them are silver, one is copper, but they have different sizes.

981
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,530
You watch how they sort out things, how fast they do it.

982
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,270
Are they using both of their hands?

983
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,630
Are there how many fingers are they using?

984
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,690
Right. What's their body posture when they're doing this?

985
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,530
Right. And how they're putting them into the jar.

986
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,230
Are they making a lot of noise, tossing it in?

987
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,250
Or are they place, you know, placing them in their hand and carefully putting them in

988
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:24,350
the jar? And and by the way, I had someone sort out coins.

989
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,830
And they put a penny in with the nickel.

990
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:36,050
So after I let them go and go and they put another penny in with the dimes, I let it

991
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,110
go. And I said, hold on a second.

992
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:40,530
I said, you know, these are Mark penny nickel dime quarters.

993
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,150
Yeah, I know. I know.

994
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,330
I said, well, there's a penny in with the nickels and a penny in with the dimes.

995
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,830
They go, yeah, I know. It doesn't matter.

996
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,410
I'm like, whoa, what did I just learn?

997
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,850
Wow. What did I just learn?

998
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,390
Right. You see how deep this is.

999
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:01,750
And no one does this. And I know someone in corporate that I told him how to use that.

1000
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,870
And he's like, oh, my gosh, that is like the deepest psychological wash through I've ever

1001
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:06,670
heard of. Right.

1002
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,910
OK. Especially especially when someone says this is beneath me.

1003
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,390
I don't want to do this. Bye.

1004
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:16,650
You see. So this is the way I do it.

1005
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,270
Because why? Because it does four, five, six.

1006
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,150
It's working on so many different levels.

1007
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,690
It's working on the first thing they've ever done in their lives, all the way to how they

1008
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:30,810
see life now and how they would react given a situation very, very deep.

1009
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,650
The other thing I mentioned just when you're doing if you're a corporate doing a hire and

1010
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,570
you're speaking to someone who has experience in a similar field, let's say.

1011
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,550
Right. Let's say you're a mechanic and you want to hire a mechanic shop.

1012
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,450
You want to hire a mechanic and you talk, whatever.

1013
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,970
One of the questions that's important is have them describe.

1014
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,550
Ask them what is the worst situation in a mechanic?

1015
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,330
Previous experience they've ever had.

1016
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,350
Why? Because when they recall that they're going to you're going to see an emotional

1017
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:02,430
reaction in their body when they recall that worst situation.

1018
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:08,470
So when they're working for you, if you recognize that the emotional condition in them

1019
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,790
or state, that means something bad is going to happen because you've already.

1020
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:13,950
Right. OK.

1021
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,770
You're not asking them what's the worst thing they've ever seen happen on the job.

1022
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:23,950
Because you want to hear a story, you want to see how they how their body reacts to it.

1023
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,510
So if you ever pick up on that later, you know something bad's happening here.

1024
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,630
Right. So there's many levels to this, by the way.

1025
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,850
You know, I should write a little handbook and give it to corporate because you don't you

1026
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,670
don't doesn't have to be just sorting coins, by the way.

1027
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,070
There are other methods.

1028
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:45,030
But I just wanted to share this because it's just another way to perceive what's going on.

1029
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:50,210
And I hope you found the sharing the coins profound because it's one thing to hear it and

1030
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,130
see its effect. And there's another thing to be there when it's happening.

1031
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:57,590
Well, I'm thinking to myself, this is the kind of thing that a lot of corporations actually pay

1032
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,610
somebody like, you know, 10, 20 grand to show up and give a PowerPoint on.

1033
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,130
Yeah, well, over the 10, 20 grand, you got to be joking.

1034
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,970
It's got to be a lot more than that because.

1035
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,950
But here's the thing.

1036
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,590
Well, there's many other ways to do it.

1037
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,570
I haven't quite figured them out, but there are ways.

1038
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,830
And this is someone I was talking to.

1039
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,110
This is like a psychological wash through.

1040
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,110
Yeah. But in the early 2000s, I guarantee you it would have been like a twenty thousand

1041
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,470
dollar fee.

1042
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:30,270
Yeah. But believe me, 20 grand is not is not enough to really make an effort in anything

1043
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,430
anymore. Sorry, but that's why we're giving it out to the subs.

1044
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:40,950
They'll let them do it. But I do business consulting, by the way, but not the way that

1045
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,530
business consulting is done.

1046
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,630
Fair enough. Fair enough.
