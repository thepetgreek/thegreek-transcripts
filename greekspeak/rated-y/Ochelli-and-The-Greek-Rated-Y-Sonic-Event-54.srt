1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,560
54, according to my count, and here we go, the higher consciousness and how it can contain

2
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:16,060
lower consciousness.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,560
You know, I'm not sure that we quite understand exactly what that means, Greek.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,500
So why don't you start there?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,820
There you go.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,780
There you go.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,260
It goes.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,400
It's a one way street.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,119
You know, they say shit flows downstream.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,320
OK, well, in other words, OK, think about it this way.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,320
You could put a five pound bag in a 10 pound bag, but you can't put a 10 pound bag, you

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
know, loaded in a five pound bag.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,280
Right.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,580
That's an old thing.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,100
You know, you're like a 10 pound bag, a 10 pound potato and a five pound bag.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,360
Right.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,400
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,720
Well, the old the old insult was what you look like, 10 pounds, 10 pounds of shit in

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,600
a five pound bag.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,860
Right.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,820
So that means I haven't heard that one, but that's maybe a Jersey thing.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,480
Maybe so.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,459
It means you're spilling out all over the place.

24
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,080
You look like a sloppy fucking mess.

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,380
Well, no, a higher consciousness, for example, I brought this up, for example.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's say this just is an academic example.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,360
Someone who is a graduate student mathematics can walk into the third grade math class and

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,800
completely comprehend everyone's ability to do math, where if the third grader walks into

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,880
the graduate student math session, they will not be able to comprehend what they're doing.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,540
Well, look, you talked about this thing with the change.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,020
All right.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,180
Where somebody thinks they're sorting change and oh, that's beneath me.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,540
Different.

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,660
Well, that's different.

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,480
That's not the level of consciousness.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,140
Well, sure.

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,580
That is a type of character.

38
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,180
Well, wait a minute.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,820
But that is isn't character related to consciousness, though, because they're not conscious of what

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,520
it is they're demonstrating at all.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:00,080
They're taking nothing quantitatively, maybe there is a correlation, but qualitatively consciousness

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,940
flips.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,560
OK, usually a higher quality consciousness has also a larger quantity and vice versa.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,720
A lower quality consciousness has also this is where the quantitative qualitative flip

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,220
happens.

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,000
You know.

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,480
All right.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,540
You know what I mean by that?

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,540
OK, so a higher quality consciousness will also have a much higher capacity, volumetric

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,320
and quantity quantified, a higher qualitative consciousness can quantify more, a lower qualitative

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,860
consciousness quantifies less, always, always.

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,880
It seems to be a correlation.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,340
Here, let's let's spin it off to this.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,080
Like the I gave the analogies of having someone take a photograph to kind of read their character.

55
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,640
Right.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,280
Most people will see.

57
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,640
I don't we'll say Greek.

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,620
I don't see how that does anything because they're that's that is an example of perception

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,000
and examination that requires a higher consciousness to see a higher qualitative and quantitative.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,840
By the way, when you when you it's one of the few things where if you increase the quality,

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,800
the quantity automatically increases.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,980
I would think you'd have to be an idiot to not understand that, you know, here's you

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,140
make a whole bunch of you make a whole bunch of subtle choices.

64
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,900
Look, just like with the change, you're making a whole bunch of subtle choices that to you.

65
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,620
No, no, no.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,520
It's not choices.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,280
It's not choices.

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,600
What you're doing is you're exhibiting on many, many, many levels, which I gave a little

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,480
bit of the background.

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,340
Why is it coins and not jelly beans?

71
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,740
Yeah, but you because you're in a commercial setting.

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,140
I understand that.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,940
Yeah.

74
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,740
But it's a primary thing.

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,340
OK, I'm comparing the picture to the change.

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,020
Bear with me a second.

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,420
The thing is, you're making a bunch of choices.

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,260
Let me let me just finish that, because there's a whole bunch of built in things that you're

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,220
going to reveal through those choices.

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,020
OK, more actions.

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
OK, very active.

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,020
If they're sitting there trying to make choices and decide on what they're going to do, that's

83
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,600
another aspect of, well, the action with the examination, really, you know, I'd say taking

84
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,060
an exam.

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,440
Yeah.

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,160
It's an examination.

87
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,060
Well, of course, that's what you're doing.

88
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,400
But when the person taking the photograph, OK, is really making a ball, you know, OK,

89
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,540
we're going to go back to the photograph.

90
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,260
That's different.

91
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,339
Yeah, that's a bunch of time.

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,540
OK, it's completely different.

93
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,240
That's a bunch of choices they made, though, because they choose an angle.

94
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,019
They choose a setting.

95
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,000
They choose how to focus.

96
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,020
It's if they can't see.

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
They don't see the choices to decide on.

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,600
You notice I keep bringing that up.

99
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,500
You know, there's a decision, but they're not doing the quantitative.

100
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,840
You are doing the quantitative and qualitative examination.

101
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,580
They're not.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,300
They don't.

103
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,400
OK, but the camera example I gave is different.

104
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,260
OK, let's let's go over it real fast.

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,780
I know I'm going to get a lot of emails on this sarcastic ones.

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,340
But in a good way, it's revealing.

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,080
OK, I'm trying to sort it with you.

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,540
Go ahead.

110
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:49,780
Good.

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,320
Yeah.

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,540
Yeah.

113
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,240
No pun intended.

114
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,420
So here's the thing.

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
The camera is totally different.

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,720
OK, the camera is you have you're in a room with someone and asking them to take a picture

117
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,740
so you could sort of examine their character and how they perceive things that other people

118
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,200
will perceive that are not there.

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,420
It's a form of communication.

120
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,920
So, for example, if you are standing somewhere and you have an object on the table and you

121
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,880
ask someone to take a picture of it, you're both in the room.

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,060
You both know what that object looks like from many perspectives, meaning even if you're

123
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,060
not moving around, you have the central focus and then you have the peripheral, right?

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,920
You have slight movements.

125
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,500
Even your breathing is enough movement.

126
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,720
That's why they hold your breath when you do something very critical, like paint a line

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,620
or draw a pull trigger.

128
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:34,920
Right.

129
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,500
So even just the slightest bod, normal bodily movements are giving you more and more perspectives

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,760
on that object, even if you're not walking around it.

131
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,860
So you're in the room with the person and you already perceive all these things about the

132
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,200
object when the photograph is taken.

133
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,640
The photograph is taken to show others what you are both seeing is the intent and what

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,680
you are seeing about the character of the person when they take the photograph is thus.

135
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,660
You know what it looks like and you're trying to communicate through a photograph what this

136
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,640
looks like to others.

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
How well did you do that?

138
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,700
Right.

139
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,480
Very often I see this in people.

140
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,260
I'll say this.

141
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,200
So someone send me a photo and they send me a photo and I'm like, I'm not quite getting

142
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,800
like there's things missing, like very important things like scale.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,420
The angle in which the photo was taken does not reveal the topic of why I wanted the photo.

144
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,680
Right.

145
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,360
So the first thing I tell people is like, look, you're there.

146
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:26,980
You see it.

147
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm not there.

148
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,740
I don't see it.

149
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,860
So you have to express to me with a photograph the most revealing it would perception that

150
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,180
you have of the object that would represent as if I was there, by the way.

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,480
How many times do you hear a critique, a positive critique on film or music, photography, whatever?

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,700
And what is the critique of the audience?

153
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,800
I felt like I was there, there, right?

154
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:02,640
That's because who is the poise selection, final shot and finished delivery of that visual

155
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:10,840
or audio visual thing was considering how do we maximize that as if the person as if

156
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,500
to give the similar impact.

157
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,820
OK, so OK, as if you were there.

158
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,740
OK, so here's a simple.

159
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,580
Well, Eric Greek sounds like you're just making a point and I may not get it or whatever.

160
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,480
But here's the thing.

161
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,600
When you take a photograph of something, look at it and then ask yourself a question.

162
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,720
If I didn't, if I wasn't here and I just saw the photograph, how much of that does it give

163
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,300
me the feeling as if I am here?

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,380
And I'll tell you, most people when they take pictures versus what you don't have any clue

165
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,700
of a very slight clue, actually, I hate people when they say I don't have any idea.

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,260
Of course you do.

167
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,760
Don't you?

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,880
You know, on Earth.

169
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,140
Right.

170
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,300
So you do have that idea.

171
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,560
But anyway, you see what I mean?

172
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,640
So when someone takes photographs, I critique that often.

173
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
I said, look, I'm not there.

174
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,680
If you by the way, if you send me a photograph and I say I'm not there, you are.

175
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,280
You need a better photograph.

176
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm basically calling you a fucking idiot.

177
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:00,980
Sorry.

178
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,860
Did I just say that?

179
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,440
No.

180
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Sorry.

181
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,120
Actually, we don't edit that out.

182
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,260
Right.

183
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,580
Never.

184
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,820
OK.

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah.

187
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,400
So anyway.

188
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,740
But that's normal.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,120
Right.

190
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,440
OK.

191
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,640
So do you see my point?

192
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,900
And look, this is this is part of the normal vernacular.

193
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,520
You'll hear common people see a photograph or a demo of something and say, wow, I feel

194
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
like I'm there.

195
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,620
Right.

196
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,500
And of course, that object they're talking about or seen or event or whatever has been

197
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,640
photographed many, many times shown to them many other ways.

198
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,480
But they don't say the same thing.

199
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,500
It's the same thing.

200
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Right.

201
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,780
Well, you know, it's the way it's.

202
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,159
So when you do something, when you write something, when you say something, when you photograph

203
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,440
something, it's all forms of what communication.

204
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,120
Right.

205
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,380
And the level of how considerate you are, the better the communication.

206
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,780
Someone who's inconsiderate, whether they know it or not, is irrelevant.

207
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,840
Right.

208
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,040
The poor, the communication.

209
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Give me an example.

210
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,060
You've been around white people at takeout.

211
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,040
I would say white people, usually I mean Americans and Westerners that have been Americanized.

212
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,580
I get it.

213
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,920
This has happened many times.

214
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
And I give people that I know a really hard time about.

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
I've seen this my entire life.

216
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,820
So it's a four or five.

217
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,200
You're doing something and you're hungry.

218
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,040
You take out.

219
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,780
Somebody comes in with the food, three, four bags or two bags or one bag.

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,060
And everybody's got a slightly different order.

221
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,040
Let's say you order burgers.

222
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,760
You know, yours is not mustard.

223
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,720
Yours is a double.

224
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,940
Yours is the cheese and French fries and a couple other things in there.

225
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,540
You know what they do?

226
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,840
They all sit down ready to eat and they pass the bag around and you've got to go searching

227
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,940
for your thing.

228
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,500
And then they they pass the bag.

229
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm like, what?

230
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,080
What are you doing?

231
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,180
What are you doing?

232
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
We're sitting down having a meal.

233
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,400
Why?

234
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:43,660
Why?

235
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,240
Give me the bag.

236
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,700
So I take the bag.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
I put it down on a flat surface.

238
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
I go, wow.

239
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,100
And I rip it open.

240
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,260
Now, Greek.

241
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,060
It's like, oh, my gosh.

242
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,520
So angry.

243
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,940
No, no.

244
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,600
First of all, that big ass brown paper bag.

245
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,960
It's usually brown paper now became like a tablecloth.

246
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,200
And I spread everything out and I'm like, OK, now we see what we got.

247
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,420
Everybody sees everything at the same time.

248
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,120
Yeah.

249
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Right.

250
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,440
What's this shit about passing the bag around?

251
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,660
Find yours and pass the bag.

252
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,120
And I've done this.

253
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,840
I've been doing this my whole life, by the way.

254
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,520
And I've even told people about this.

255
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,820
And then when it comes time to take out, guess what?

256
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,380
They're still passing.

257
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,760
Remember, I talked about it.

258
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Talk about what?

259
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,020
Oh, my gosh.

260
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,240
Oh, my gosh.

261
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,600
Now, this is right now.

262
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,500
If you're around white people, you'll know what I just said is true because you've experienced

263
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,680
it.

264
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,240
Hey, you might even be doing it yourself.

265
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,380
When I'm around those people, what I got to do is I go, OK, let's go back over what everybody

266
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,080
said they got.

267
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,720
And then it comes all everything comes out of the bag and I kind of deal it out like

268
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,860
cards because I can't stand that.

269
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,140
Yes.

270
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,780
Yeah, exactly.

271
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,240
You know what?

272
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
You've seen what I'm talking about.

273
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,920
Yes.

274
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,820
But that's why I deal it out, because I'm just like, no, we know all of what's here

275
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,260
all together.

276
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,660
So nobody's going, oh, I didn't get.

277
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,860
But I don't I don't even bother.

278
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,500
I just ripped the whole bag over.

279
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,300
You're talking about.

280
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,900
Yeah, of course.

281
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,700
So now we have a tablecloth because the brown, you know, if it's a tall enough bag, you're

282
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,240
right.

283
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Plastic bags.

284
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,580
The same thing.

285
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,200
I've seen that every someone person's, you know, sometimes you do the takeout.

286
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,500
I don't want to get into this, but it's interesting because here's the other smaller optional things

287
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,920
that happen.

288
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,120
It's a plastic bag.

289
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,620
Right.

290
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,440
And the person who you're all busy doing something, you're all haven't arrived.

291
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,660
Somebody's washing their hands.

292
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,100
The other person.

293
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,980
One person gets there and they take out their thing and they start eating.

294
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,120
And there's this plastic bag.

295
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,660
And from there is like, OK, where's the food?

296
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh, the food's in the bag.

297
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,900
Man, if I'm the first person at that setting, I start taking everything out.

298
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,800
Now, most people say, well, we don't yeah, we don't do it like, you know, here's the

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,120
prompt.

300
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,860
If there's a whole bunch of cutlery and plates in there.

301
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeah.

302
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,780
They typically take everything out of the bag because it kind of supposedly it's like

303
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,340
synthesizing dinnertime.

304
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,880
Right.

305
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,560
You know, you know what I mean?

306
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,420
The hint like take.

307
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,180
So there's so many things that I've seen like that.

308
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,340
And it's cultural with white people, typically white people, meaning Americans.

309
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:52,900
Right.

310
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,160
Right.

311
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,540
And I was listening to a gorgeous audio book.

312
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm working on a scale reader today.

313
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,460
And that's the water device.

314
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,580
And I have audio books in the background.

315
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,640
And I'm like, oh, my gosh, this guy wrote this in like 1904.

316
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,840
He sounds just like the Greek.

317
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,840
It's terrible.

318
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,720
You know, I mean, terrible or good or whatever you want to say, you know, like one of his

319
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,760
comments was, you know, when I was in America, I spent most of my time in the movies because

320
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,280
the culture.

321
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,000
So whatever.

322
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,660
And they don't think that they tell me that, you know, American life is not like American

323
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,440
movies and he begs to differ and he explains why I'm like, oh, my gosh, he's so crazy.

324
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,200
Sounds just like you listen to Greek speak.

325
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,660
But he died before I was way even before my parents were born.

326
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,740
So anyway, there's a lot of commonality to what I'm saying and most people get it.

327
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,520
That's OK.

328
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
So that's the idea.

329
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,640
The same thing.

330
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,560
The camera is very simple.

331
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,820
We're here or you're here and who you're sending the photograph to or showing it to a later

332
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,000
months because we're more alive.

333
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
Let's say whether it's film print, we've got to go to photomat and print it.

334
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,680
Yeah.

335
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,080
Right.

336
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,560
And you have to wait a few days or whether it's digital.

337
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,600
It's memorialized unless you delete it or tear it up, throw it away.

338
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,640
So it's memorialized.

339
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,780
You're going to be showing it to people most likely who were not there.

340
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
What are they going to see?

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,660
Right.

342
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,500
How much of that situation of fear and feeling of being there is being transmitted and communicated

343
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,140
through what you're memorialized?

344
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,920
See, I do my best, though, to communicate the information required.

345
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm just saying that when I am asked to take a picture of something, I do my best to take

346
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,040
into account the information that they want.

347
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,740
If they want a detail on a particular thing, I try and know.

348
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,420
Chuck, I'm going to I'm going to step on you.

349
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,200
That's not about you.

350
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,740
It's not about me.

351
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,240
What I'm trying to do is an objective, objectify the situation.

352
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,940
Yeah.

353
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,300
Right.

354
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,860
And if you can give me an example of another objective example of it, go ahead.

355
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,480
But don't I don't like to say what I would do.

356
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,120
And the only reason I bring up the personal stuff that what I would do is is because I

357
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,420
need to back up the reason.

358
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,380
So I could always you know what?

359
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,880
OK, how about we do all the sonics based on third person?

360
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,580
Because very often I talk about the Greek in third person.

361
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,200
Well, no problem.

362
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,680
So we'll go objective on this because you know what?

363
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,020
The information required that needs to be communicated.

364
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,440
Forget about who is who.

365
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,780
Oh, there's no requirement to be a difference.

366
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,680
With most personal situations, there's no requirement unless you're doing what a technical

367
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,160
manual.

368
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,920
If someone asked for a photograph to be taken, they generally had a purpose for that.

369
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
I'm thinking, you know, generally.

370
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,780
But you'll see requirements like a few example, like the Haynes motor, you know, the car fix

371
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,560
it manuals where they have photos included.

372
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,040
Those must be as communicative as possible.

373
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,360
But what I'm saying is the population at large has no idea what I'm talking about.

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,580
But once it's mentioned to them, like, yeah, of course, of course, that makes sense.

375
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,200
Of course, that's how it should be done.

376
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Here's an example.

377
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:00,960
Like years ago, paper, ink, books, magazines were precious in the medieval ages.

378
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,000
It would be equivalent of 10 to 20 thousand dollars for a book in today's money.

379
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,700
Right.

380
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,220
Back in the days when they printed newspapers.

381
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, you know, we get the impression that they're mass producing.

382
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,640
Well, they're mass produced, but they were very they were.

383
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,220
When you finished reading it, you gave it to someone else to continue reading it.

384
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,440
Right.

385
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,500
It wasn't thrown in the recycling bin.

386
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,800
It was still very precious.

387
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,300
Right.

388
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,720
So.

389
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,400
So let's just say the even when at the height of photography, film photography, which was

390
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,240
by the late 70s, right, everyone had a camera.

391
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,460
That's when the Polaroid camera instrument, right.

392
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,940
Tremendous amount of.

393
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,540
I think there was almost anyway, there were more cameras and cars being sold until the

394
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,260
late 70s.

395
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,460
Right.

396
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:42,840
Right.

397
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,240
So.

398
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,120
So that was the peak.

399
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,280
And then it went down and then it picked up again.

400
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,320
And now what now you have no choice because what you have, the stupid rectangle is really

401
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,920
a camera that happens to have the feature of acting as a phone.

402
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,020
So what I'm trying and this is even more important now because there are more photographs

403
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,540
being taken now and it's not viewed as anything precious because you could just hit delete

404
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,060
and do it again.

405
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,960
But, you know, it is precious wasting the time of who is looking at that tripe.

406
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,560
Can't make any sense out of it.

407
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:10,860
Right.

408
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,740
You see the difference.

409
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,940
So now where's the preciousness coming?

410
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,980
Where is the scarcity?

411
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,680
The scarcity is in time.

412
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,140
Now, you know, here's the thing.

413
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,220
It has what it shows you about the character of the person is how much they care about

414
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,380
communicating and also how much they see.

415
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,740
Some people can't perceive what you think.

416
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,460
You hand them something or they're in a room with you.

417
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,880
You think they perceive what you do.

418
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,520
No, they may not.

419
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,820
You know, they may not see that you see it.

420
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,460
So what that does again, I take me a picture and I look at the picture.

421
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,240
It's like I can't make out what it is.

422
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,540
I mean, I kind of know what it is generally, but it doesn't help me in any way.

423
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,200
Right.

424
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,360
What that tells me is that person either can't see or doesn't know the importance of communication.

425
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Right.

426
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,840
By the way, when you say communication, most people think it's speaking.

427
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,020
Right.

428
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,200
It's not.

429
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:05,760
What do you think?

430
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,800
Graffiti is right.

431
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,359
Tags.

432
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,619
Right.

433
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:07,980
People.

434
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,040
That's a communication.

435
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,460
Right.

436
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,480
All these things.

437
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,660
You know, when you ever see, you know, when dogs go on a walk, they stop and smell reading

438
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,200
the emails.

439
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,720
Right.

440
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,380
So anyway, communication to me is just a transfer of information.

441
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:21,980
I mean, yeah.

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,420
Yeah.

443
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,240
That's why the dogs.

444
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,579
Yes.

445
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,839
Smell the pee to us.

446
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,599
It's just to them.

447
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,099
It's a female.

448
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,720
It doesn't matter.

449
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,360
You could do that with a scent for people.

450
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,000
You know, when you pick up a smell going into somewhere, just by the fact that you permitted

451
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,980
a smell in an area, you're communicating something, aren't you?

452
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
Sort of.

453
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,040
Well, we just it just jogs our memory.

454
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,500
It doesn't give specific information like when a dog smells a female, it's got just like

455
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,420
we would do an email.

456
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,680
You can have any amount of detail for us.

457
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,960
Smells pretty much just trigger something from the past, because if you smell something

458
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,280
that you didn't smell in the past, you what's the first thing people say?

459
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,100
What's that smell?

460
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:57,920
Right.

461
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,020
They don't get information from it directly.

462
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,120
Well, they're still catalog it so that they can, you know, because they want the recognizable

463
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,460
that smells like this.

464
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,680
It smells similar to that.

465
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:06,900
Yeah.

466
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,220
Let's jump to the coins.

467
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,900
Very simply.

468
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,320
The coins are completely different.

469
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,660
The coins are.

470
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,660
Remember, it was a job application, right?

471
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,320
Or a job.

472
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,660
You know, the difference in a job and a job.

473
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,760
Right.

474
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,400
Anyway.

475
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,080
Yeah.

476
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,460
No, man, I got I got a job today.

477
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,100
OK.

478
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,540
So that's different than a job.

479
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,780
Right.

480
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,820
But still, whether it's a job or a job explanation application, what is that?

481
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,860
That's commercial, isn't it?

482
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,440
OK.

483
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,980
So that's why I gave all the details on why we do coins.

484
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,200
It's the first thing that you engaged in commerce.

485
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,620
You say, no, Greek, first time I engaged in commerce, I was four years old, I bought a

486
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,060
piece of candy.

487
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,260
Yeah.

488
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,600
What did you use to buy a piece of candy?

489
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
A piece of coin.

490
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,220
This is the first money.

491
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,680
Right.

492
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,000
Because jobs do money.

493
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,080
And then all of this has to do with time, ego approach.

494
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,200
Right.

495
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,380
I think I gave some examples on one person walking in.

496
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,520
So I have a master's degree.

497
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,240
This is bullshit.

498
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,920
OK.

499
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,440
You know what that person would do?

500
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,320
You hire them based on their credentials.

501
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:08,720
Right.

502
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,180
Mm hmm.

503
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,940
And you and you have you go into their work area and there's a wastebasket is full and

504
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,420
overflowing and you're like, dude, you know, your wastebasket.

505
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,440
Yeah, that's that's that's.

506
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,460
But I don't do that kind of empty wastebasket.

507
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,300
Right.

508
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,300
You know what I mean?

509
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,880
You see what I mean?

510
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,420
So you want, you know, so it shows you.

511
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,820
So in other words, can you can see the person who got offended by doing that coin sorting

512
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,180
exam?

513
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,160
Mm hmm.

514
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,980
If you hired him, you could see how that would be an example.

515
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,360
Right.

516
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:36,900
Right.

517
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,980
I don't have to get the garbage.

518
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,900
You know, it's like, whoa.

519
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,840
So you learn so much, by the way, if this has helped out some people that have businesses

520
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,140
and.

521
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,220
All right.

522
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,240
So that is completely different.

523
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,980
Also, what's the other example I gave is there was a penny in with the dimes and the nickels

524
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,160
that say, well, you know, there's a penny in with the dime and the nickel.

525
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,460
They're clearly different, not only are they different sizes, but the first thing you notice

526
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,780
is the color is very different.

527
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,140
Right.

528
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,580
Because I noticed it from across the way, let's say.

529
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:06,880
Right.

530
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,400
OK.

531
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,460
And when I asked him, why, why did you decide to put that in there?

532
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,400
Says it doesn't matter.

533
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,620
Oh, my gosh.

534
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,640
Oh, my gosh.

535
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,620
Now, let's say you hired that person.

536
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,500
I can't even give you an example because of what they could do on the job, because it's

537
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,080
freaking ridiculous what they could do on the job.

538
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,540
Right.

539
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,000
Can you imagine someone who has a doesn't matter attitude?

540
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,080
Would you.

541
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,540
Right.

542
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,120
I mean, can you give an example on how something can go?

543
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,060
No, because pretty much everything will go wrong with that.

544
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,760
No.

545
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,080
Right.

546
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,020
Even even though they look polite or whatever.

547
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Right.

548
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,720
It could because they won't seek to correct something if it's going in the wrong direction.

549
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Yeah.

550
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,960
Although just let it go.

551
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,020
And it's like you will find if it's not something that's brought to your attention, it could

552
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,180
go.

553
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
These things can get right.

554
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,040
It doesn't matter for a long time.

555
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,600
It doesn't matter that broken glass fell into the candy bat.

556
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,220
Whatever.

557
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:54,940
Yeah.

558
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,220
Or the or the milk delivery has been sitting out in the sun in the back of the building

559
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,020
for four hours.

560
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,340
Right.

561
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,440
Right.

562
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,800
Or the cow or whatever.

563
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,760
The cow peed in it.

564
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,700
You know, I mean, it's fine.

565
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:02,980
Yeah.

566
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,800
Gosh.

567
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,380
And you know, it's interesting.

568
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,720
This thing is very objective.

569
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,220
The coin sorting, because the person walks in, oh, this guy looks really clean cut and

570
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,480
he looks like he has a good demeanor and they're, you know, pretty handsome and they make a good

571
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,460
presentation and they're well spoken.

572
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,840
Oh, this one's a pretty good, pretty good potential.

573
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
And then they tell you it doesn't matter.

574
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,320
It's like, oh, my gosh, if I hired him on looks alone, I would have been screwed.

575
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah.

576
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:25,980
Right.

577
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,080
Yeah.

578
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,180
Right.

579
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,500
Because seeking to preen himself does not mean that he seeks to keep anything else well

580
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,760
kept.

581
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,760
It's just himself.

582
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,380
Right.

583
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,920
Or it doesn't.

584
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
Or maybe he's well kept because it just happens to be that way.

585
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,120
He still doesn't care.

586
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,180
But here's the point.

587
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Could just be out of habit or reflex.

588
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,060
You know.

589
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,400
Go ahead.

590
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:38,620
Yeah.

591
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,080
Yeah.

592
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,220
That is an exam that covers on many.

593
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,400
Actually, if you go through that audio again.

594
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:43,840
Yeah.

595
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,380
And I'm actually covering about 99 percent of what they teach in psychology about human,

596
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,700
you know, in that type of environment, because there are a lot of stuff written about.

597
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,420
Actually, I first started learning the importance of the mental state and financial state of

598
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,660
the quote unquote workplace from the reading stuff in the eighteen hundreds.

599
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,160
You know what?

600
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
That was a very big topic.

601
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,140
There was a lot of stuff written about it.

602
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,960
In modern hundreds.

603
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,240
Right.

604
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,160
In modern studies, they would file this under behavioral science.

605
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,860
But whatever.

606
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,900
It goes to psychology degrees.

607
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,220
Go ahead.

608
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,480
Yeah.

609
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,080
But yeah.

610
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,360
But the mindset.

611
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,920
They didn't use psychology.

612
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
They used mindset.

613
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:21,480
Right.

614
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,320
Mindset, desires, anticipations and behaviors.

615
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,060
I was like, wow, this is stressful.

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,440
Maybe I just came across literature that addressed these points because it was.

617
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,440
Look, at that time, there was the industrial revolution was in full swing.

618
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,000
And what's the industrial revolution?

619
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,080
Is it people outpushed, you know, behind some cattle on a farm?

620
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,420
No, it's about a whole bunch of people crammed into a building making stuff.

621
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:43,720
Right.

622
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,780
Yeah.

623
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,100
So you have very high density.

624
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,740
Like on a farm, you might have 20 people on 100 acres.

625
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,140
But in a factory, you might have 20 people in less than 50 and a thousand square feet

626
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,300
or less easily.

627
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:54,680
Right.

628
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,320
Yeah.

629
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,120
On an acre, you might have a thousand people working.

630
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,420
So it was very important.

631
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,780
So anyway, I gave those examples.

632
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,600
But here's the thing.

633
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,400
The higher consciousness contains the lower one.

634
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:12,160
By the way, both of these examples, the coin sorting and the and the camera shot is from

635
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,540
the point of view of a higher consciousness or a higher consciousness, both qualitatively

636
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,280
first, higher quality will automatically get a bigger quantity.

637
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,580
Now, there's an exception with savants like so this guy's a mathematics savant.

638
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,320
He can tell you anything with numbers, but he's an idiot everywhere else.

639
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,580
Right.

640
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,960
So so he's actually super narrow.

641
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,700
Right.

642
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,160
So without being a savant.

643
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,700
But as the consciousness increases in quality, its quantity of able.

644
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,220
Right.

645
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,720
So it's basically this way.

646
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,480
The higher consciousness being able to contain the lower consciousness.

647
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,520
This is the cartoon image of a big fish swallowing a smaller fish.

648
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Right.

649
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,760
So give you an example.

650
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,100
Like when you look at what the official stories are, it doesn't matter.

651
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,600
By the way, what people think is official is not official.

652
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,380
Like with the pandemic, they're saying we're doing this because the CDC.

653
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,220
CDC is a corporation.

654
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,160
It's not even it's not part of the government.

655
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,040
It's it has a cage code, which is corporate and government entity.

656
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,420
Right.

657
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,000
It's funny how it's called cage.

658
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,260
Right.

659
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,940
Yeah, of course.

660
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,240
It's not part of the government.

661
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,580
It's it was basically set up.

662
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
And that's why the head of the C it's military.

663
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,720
It's part.

664
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,640
It's a quasi military organization.

665
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,160
That's why the head of the CDC is always in uniform.

666
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,220
Right.

667
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,020
Always.

668
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,040
Well, not always, but it has been typically as a military person.

669
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,720
Right.

670
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,020
But anyway, and the same with the surgeon general.

671
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,380
It's always a military, right.

672
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,500
Uniform of some kind.

673
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,300
Regardless of that, they're not official.

674
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,440
So most of the stuff that you're hearing, let's say that you might think or is

675
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,720
touted as being official, is really dumb.

676
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,480
And it's usually not.

677
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,440
Forget about that.

678
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,140
It's all bullshit.

679
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,580
Even from the beginning, you know, 200 years ago or more from this country.

680
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,860
Let's say it's all BS.

681
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,380
But let's say you don't consider the BS part, but just consider on what mental

682
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,500
state, cognitive or intelligent level it's written on.

683
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,400
It's very, very low.

684
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,760
But most of the people go for it because they are contained by it.

685
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,040
In other words, even though you might look at what the government tells you

686
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,120
about aspartame or chemtrails or the vaccine, and you're like, that's real

687
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,700
total BS and it's stupid.

688
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
Most people look at that as that's coming from a higher consciousness.

689
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,280
And to them it is.

690
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,740
Right.

691
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,340
So here's a quick way to gauge.

692
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
If you find what's put out officially, whether it's the Vatican or your

693
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,700
government or some major corporation to be really stupid, which it is.

694
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,450
And others don't.

695
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
Others take it very seriously.

696
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,480
Guess what?

697
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,160
It's like they're four ounce bag and you're a one pound bag.

698
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,460
Right.

699
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,060
Or, you know, they're a hundred grams and you're a kilo.

700
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,620
You see the difference?

701
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,060
So the person who believes the official stories or thinks whatever,

702
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,320
they cannot get any more information on the subject.

703
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,660
They're already saturated just being told junk.

704
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,610
Where someone who sees it as bullshit can take a lot more, would research

705
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,490
the evidence behind it or, you know, the real history behind it and

706
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,990
contain more information, you see.

707
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,350
So automatically they.

708
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,070
Right.

709
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,390
So imagine taking quote unquote average Sam or average Joe who believes

710
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,870
that the government is absolutely correct about taking an injection.

711
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,410
You know, there's no evidence.

712
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:23,810
There's no.

713
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,610
Well, I don't.

714
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,650
That's too much for me.

715
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,990
You hear that a lot.

716
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,870
That's too much.

717
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:28,970
Right.

718
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,650
You hear it, right?

719
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,890
So we've got a low consciousness.

720
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,710
It doesn't mean they're bad.

721
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,190
Here's the part.

722
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,130
Maybe if you're listening to what I'm saying, it leaves a taste that you're

723
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,450
getting the taste that I'm saying these people are bad.

724
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,310
No, they're not bad at all.

725
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,350
But are they good?

726
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,030
Hell no.

727
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,210
They're not good either, but they're not bad.

728
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,030
You see what I mean?

729
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,290
And by the way, again, another term.

730
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,910
How is that?

731
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,810
That's not bad.

732
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,210
Oh, but is it good?

733
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,430
They say it's not bad and they say it's good.

734
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,530
I got a hard time with not thinking they're bad, though, because of the

735
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,390
results of your actions are destructive.

736
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,890
Doesn't that make you bad?

737
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,630
If you're pretty much not doing anything but taking up space and you get a

738
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:20,330
shot and you drop dead in my book, I don't see that as being destructive.

739
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,250
In other words, what I'm seeing and saying is this.

740
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,190
If these people are operating on that level, the only form of destruction

741
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,190
that they could cause is their own demise.

742
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:40,870
Unless, of course, they join the army or the police or work in a bank or

743
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,090
work in the medical community.

744
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,730
Oh, man.

745
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,210
Now we're covering most of this.

746
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,810
So it goes both ways.

747
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,390
You see what I mean?

748
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,810
I got you.

749
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,490
I'm just thinking.

750
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,450
How are they destructive?

751
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,910
How is the common whatever?

752
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,250
Oh, who's awful?

753
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,210
Destructive?

754
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:55,570
How?

755
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,690
Littering?

756
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,830
I don't know.

757
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,010
To me, the destruction is basically taking up space.

758
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,650
We're running generators down at the end of town where the big electrical

759
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,130
generator is burning all this coal to power their CNN and their football

760
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,470
games and the refrigerator that's full of toxins.

761
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,810
Yeah, that could be.

762
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,690
Indirectly, they're destructive.

763
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,430
Yeah, I could see.

764
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,570
But directly, I don't see them as being destructive.

765
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,450
They could join the army or become a doctor.

766
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,770
Right.

767
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,410
Or work in a bank or whatever.

768
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,110
But you see how it goes the other way, too.

769
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,970
I just figure that the actions of somebody actively attempting to

770
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,210
destroy, you know, it was just not even not even a positive thing.

771
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,230
It's got to be negative to do.

772
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,070
What are they destroying?

773
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,850
Even if they're destroying useless, useless people, you know, is it

774
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,390
their right?

775
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:47,930
Oh, no, no.

776
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,990
I'm talking about those that are on the lower consciousness of being

777
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,590
destructive.

778
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,410
I think we came off on the thing.

779
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,690
No, I don't think they're destructive.

780
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,450
Is what was what my point was.

781
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,570
No, they're just use.

782
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,770
I mean, they're useful for something.

783
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,850
Look, ask the military.

784
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,790
Ask the prison system.

785
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,910
Prison system is the prison in the hospital is the bank, by the way.

786
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,250
Of course.

787
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,470
Right.

788
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,110
If you ever see road signs, your bonds are paying for the roads.

789
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,670
Bonds are paying for the state.

790
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:15,790
Right.

791
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,830
Never says your taxes.

792
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,250
Never.

793
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,370
It's the bonds.

794
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,330
Where those bonds come from.

795
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,590
Right.

796
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,270
You know, bond of the birth certificates on.

797
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,590
Right.

798
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,210
And prison people charged and sucked in prison.

799
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,370
Oh, here's the other thing.

800
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,370
People are talking about how you fix the system and all that.

801
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,950
So what do you mean if everyone just follows the rules?

802
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,750
Like, for example, if you're at a poker game and it goes awry.

803
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,750
All you got to do is go back to following the rules.

804
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,230
But game will straighten out itself.

805
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,610
Right.

806
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,290
Usually.

807
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,770
So like all these people want to send less than all you got to do is get enough people

808
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,230
to sign a petition, put any government, local, federal, state officials on notice that all

809
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,630
the current laws, statutes, codes and regulations and ordinances are still in effect.

810
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,970
That's all you have to say in the letter.

811
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,110
That'll scare the bejesus out of them.

812
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,650
Because that means now, you know, it's kind of like with voting.

813
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:11,530
If everything the government says is a lie, that means that every election result is also

814
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:11,890
what?

815
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,370
Right.

816
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,090
A lie.

817
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,570
So right.

818
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,430
So people are complaining about the recent election being.

819
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,550
Wait a second.

820
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,150
It's kind of an oxymoron.

821
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,030
And if you really want to make a change, don't vote.

822
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,710
If no one showed up to vote.

823
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,630
I've been saying this at all.

824
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,370
They would all pack up and leave and it would be empty.

825
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,890
Anybody could walk in and take over.

826
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,570
I'm serious.

827
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,530
Well, I mean, wouldn't be.

828
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,530
But that's the metaphor.

829
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,850
So it's the same thing with all of this stuff.

830
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,430
But anyway, to make a change politically or even in court, if you're going to go court,

831
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,630
just say put the judge on notice that all the whatever, wherever local, whatever it's

832
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,730
state, federal, whatever, that let's say it's a state.

833
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,210
You see all just put them.

834
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:04,890
This is a notice that all the state laws, codes, rules and regulations all the way down to

835
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,230
the little smallest statute are still in effect.

836
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,570
That scares the hell out of them.

837
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,630
That scares the hell out of them because they're not using or don't they don't.

838
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,530
First of all, they don't know any of them in context.

839
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:15,890
Right.

840
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,990
Right.

841
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,450
So, yeah, that's all.

842
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,350
So all you have to do.

843
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,030
Right.

844
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,910
Any of this stuff is whoever's running the show in whatever department or group you're

845
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,430
a part of.

846
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,530
Just tell them that you think of the Catholic Church.

847
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,890
The Bible is still in effect.

848
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,130
Right.

849
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,070
We go by the Bible.

850
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,450
If you go to any Catholic institution or Catholic authority and say that the Bible

851
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,430
is the authority, that's they'll poop in their pants right there.

852
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,090
Right.

853
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,670
Oh, yeah.

854
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,310
Because to them, the church is the authority, not the Bible.

855
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,990
Right.

856
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,210
But they do mix it.

857
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:46,710
Right.

858
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,130
So the same with the courts, the same with the politicians.

859
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:49,710
It's policy.

860
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,170
Well, you could do your ever policy you want, but we're putting you on notice that the

861
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,690
laws, codes, rules and statutes are all in effect.

862
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,070
People say, well, it's not law.

863
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,430
It's code.

864
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,130
No, no, no.

865
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,630
Codes and statutes are codified under law.

866
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,770
That's all of it is law.

867
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,150
Well, that's why I say the power vested in me.

868
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:05,510
Right.

869
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,490
That's the always the state.

870
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,690
The power vested in me by whether it's a, you know, a.

871
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,550
That's OK.

872
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,530
There's many ways.

873
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,030
Yeah.

874
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,350
Oh, yeah.

875
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,210
Just put him on notice.

876
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,110
OK, so if a card game goes awry.

877
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,050
All you got to say is the rules of poker still hold up.

878
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,010
Watch how everybody straightens up.

879
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,570
Right.

880
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,270
Oh, whatever.

881
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,050
Playing Monopoly.

882
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,810
OK, the rules of Monopoly have to be observed.

883
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,970
Everybody straightens up.

884
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,750
Right.

885
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,230
It's very simple.

886
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,210
You know, in other words, people are taking these three.

887
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,250
Why did I bring this up?

888
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:40,190
Because the taking the camera to review someone's character and the coin sorting thing are very

889
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,610
specific to the character.

890
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:47,310
But going back to the rules that are that are in place is for everyone.
