1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,000
Sonic Event 45, Ocelli and the Greek, and here we go.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,860
I'll tell you this, looks like you got a few things in the chat and maybe some other communications

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,660
to sort out, so I don't know if I'll have a lot to say here and this might be one of those

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,200
quick ones.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,100
So, here we go.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,040
Where do we begin, Greek?

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,780
How are you tonight?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm alright.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,220
We're coming up on the 8th month here pretty soon it looks like, the year's going by fast.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,440
I want to get into basically energy perception so you can manage it.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,140
I worked for someone a long time ago for about a week and he said if you can't, it was science

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,720
stuff, if you can't, a loudspeaker design, and then, well anyway, we're not kidding.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,120
When you're 18, 19 and working with stuff that people usually go to engineering degrees

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,160
and you can mix right in with them and do what they do, it's kind of strange to them,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
but they accept you.

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,560
I was in a very good situation.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,520
One of the things I left with was, they were saying if you can't measure it, you can't

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
manage it, right?

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,520
So, you know, it's like, what's that smell?

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,060
You know, if you don't know where it's coming from, you're going to have to put up with it,

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,300
right?

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
It's kind of, what's that sound?

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,120
Or if you don't know, you know, where it's coming from first and what's making it, you

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,260
know, you're going to have to put up with it.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,900
So what's going on is, how do we measure and look at energies?

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,620
You know, back to the chat, I want to go back to just Yin and Yang, and whoever is familiar

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,400
with the chat.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,720
Wouldn't identifying it be the first step, though, because you got to, like you're saying,

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,360
what is it?

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,360
You got to know what it is first, and then you can measure it, because...

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,200
Yeah, and measurement is a way to make it more tangible, because there are things that

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,400
we can't measure that we could still use based on their effects, like the ether.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,140
Well, like Yin and Yang, like, okay, so that's what we're going to get into.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,500
Well, yeah, but first, why not identify exactly what it is you're looking for?

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,880
Like, how is it you're going to pick up on that to begin with?

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
I mean...

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,500
No, no, it's about direction.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
It's about direction.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Energy.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,479
Energy is all about direction.

41
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,320
If you have something that's not, let's say, in a common way, whether it's correct or incorrect,

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,380
when you call something giving off energy or whatever, the first thing that we say about

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,660
it is based on its direction, right?

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,000
We notice the directional movement.

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,620
Something is, something dynamic, some kind of action in some direction, even if it's

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,600
going in all directions, like a light bulb, for example, versus a laser, which is focused.

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,120
So let's get started on this.

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,780
This is a thing, people that have been almost doing shout-outs to archaics, even though

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,620
I don't endorse him.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,080
You know?

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,380
Like, if he invited me to go and speak, I wouldn't.

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,840
It's just too much, you know what I mean?

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
And vice versa.

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,280
But he puts out some good stuff, and the good stuff here is, you'll see if you're familiar

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,260
with archaics material.

56
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,380
Okay.

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,160
As you said previously, you should always listen because you can take something from

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,880
a situation, even if there's not a lot of useful things there, there might be something

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,400
and you can almost always learn something if you just listen.

60
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,040
Yeah, there's some gratitude I have because of the chronology.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,220
This is not from him, but it allowed me to tie this in.

62
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,220
The yin and yang, when you start saying that stuff, yin-yang, right, or whatever, that's

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,960
almost a putan, and back you see your yin-yang or whatever, everyone takes it as being Eastern.

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
It's actually not.

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,620
It comes back from a prehistorical time where we can go back and say, well, most sources

66
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,240
might agree.

67
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,300
Emperor Yao, the first emperor, was the one that put the culture living in that part of

68
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,320
the world in Asia on notice of yin and yang and the energies and what are named many

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,600
other things like qi, prana, whatever.

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,700
Emperor Yao was about six foot eight, red-haired, blue eyes.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,240
All right, so very Asian-looking, right?

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,780
Okay.

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,060
Yeah.

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Not at all.

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,600
He's the one that put the culture on back then.

76
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,620
This is right around flood days, right?

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
Asia, what planet, you know?

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,339
China, yeah.

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,380
And this was known amongst others.

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,120
In other words, he came from a milieu or a collective that this was known, that went

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,200
all over the world and ruled basic pockets of humanity.

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,940
Same people.

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,980
If you look even down to the Scythians, they were six foot seven, six foot eight, seven

84
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,700
foot tall, red-haired, blue eyes.

85
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,800
Is this the same guy who's credited with unifying China eventually from the fiefdoms?

86
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,620
Okay.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm just checking.

88
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
No, there was no China.

89
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,620
It was just nomadic people before that.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,680
So anyway, I just wanted, this is not, look, you know, I have a lot of problems with macrobiotics

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
because there's nowhere to send people.

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,320
The concept is very sound, but it's really, what you'll find is a modified Japanese diet.

93
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,820
And then you'll have the personalities of Michio Kushi and others who were actually slightly

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,640
just, we call them disturbed individuals.

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,880
They couldn't fit into their society and they really didn't fit in here, you know?

96
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,640
So when I say disturbed, they were disturbing because they were very rigid.

97
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,180
But a lot of the stuff you see in the videos, so I met Michio Kushi several times and I was

98
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,700
asked to make a dessert for a dinner that was held for him back in 1988.

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,620
Anyway, they're very, very rigid.

100
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,660
And they put out their information as if they're not.

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,000
So you have to be very careful.

102
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,040
So everyone links it to being Japanese or, well, all these Asian cats, right?

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,700
All these Asian guys, right, and gals.

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,700
So there's a way to get away from it and the basic core there is.

105
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,320
And that's why I brought up Emperia.

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,260
I was not Asian.

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,480
So this core fundamental reasoning came from a pre, you might even say pre-Adamic society,

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,080
right?

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,860
Which is pretty much, you know, we're the descendants of anyway, not we, who's we?

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,860
So here's the idea, that the universe is always in balance and flux no matter what.

111
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,400
It always will try to make balance and when you're watching something change or grow, that's

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,620
what you're actually watching.

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
And once the balance is achieved, just like scales, if you have some very simple balance

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,920
scales, there's a lot of motion while you're loading and unloading them, but once the balance

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,220
is achieved, you look at the system and it's static, right?

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,140
No movement, right?

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,440
So basically, let's just take some of the pine needle ideas that were going up.

118
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,000
There was a, I keep posting images of the brown rice number eight, it's number eight

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,980
because I put the Imabashi plum in there, but I call it brown rice seven or brown rice

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,560
eight, just to inspire and just show what finished product may look like, right?

121
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,300
Especially what I was going to do, I should have, was do all the pre-cut items and everything

122
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,760
before it's combined and cooked, just to see the cut and all that.

123
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,000
So you didn't communicate well with the picture here, referring back to last Sonic, right?

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,960
What's the finished product?

125
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,520
What I wanted to do was do another posting that shows the pre-cut, before everything

126
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,200
is combined, what the cuts are like.

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,940
Well, that's what I'm saying.

128
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,520
You didn't communicate the process.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,320
No, I didn't communicate that because there are people who are already jumped in making

130
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,540
it.

131
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,000
So I wanted to see if the final product was similar.

132
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,700
See what they would come up with on their own without it, and then go backwards.

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,820
But you can still see the cut in there, the vegetable.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,060
You could still see the cut.

135
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,460
Oh, yeah.

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,640
You can see how it was cut.

137
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,220
Even if you look at a soup, you can tell, okay, this was diced.

138
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,120
This was, you know.

139
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,900
Well, we're looking at the rice, you could see the various cuts and it's basically a bias

140
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,180
cut.

141
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:57,600
Everything is, except for the onion, which is cut longitudinally, always cut across the

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,180
root and the top.

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,540
All right.

144
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,060
So the reason I had gotten several messages, I want to add this to it.

145
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,260
And it's like, no, no, no, no.

146
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,140
This is not about taste or flavor, right?

147
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,160
It's about energy balance.

148
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,400
And the finished plates that I showed on plating, I added a picante sauce and a parsley pesto,

149
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,660
which is just finely chopped parsley with a mubashi plum vinegar and olive oil.

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,180
But the energy in itself is, this has nothing to do with taste and flavor.

151
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,240
And I think most of the people get that, right?

152
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,580
Because I think someone posted that's amazing.

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,240
When you make this and eat it, it tastes good and it gives you the energy of a steak or

154
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,100
a good burger, right?

155
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,539
That's the idea.

156
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,880
But what it is, it's a very balanced, it has a very roundabout gathering of energies.

157
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,340
That's what we're going to get into.

158
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,280
So let's just use the yin and yang vernacular because it's easy to communicate.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,820
But if anyone gets on you because it's Asian, that means we have to work even more to de-Asian,

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
decentralize it from that notion of being Asian alone, right?

161
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,920
That's what I try to do when I brought up Emperor Yao.

162
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,360
So let's just start, for example.

163
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,740
So cold is considered a very yin energy, yin being expansive and all that.

164
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,260
Now, when I say yin and yang, if you were to look up yin and yang, they have like less

165
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,860
than third grader definitions of it on the internet, no matter where you look.

166
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,380
It'll be a chart, right?

167
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,740
Yin on one side, yang on the other.

168
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,920
And you just read what's on the chart.

169
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,240
That's like not even third grade.

170
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,260
That's like second or first grade, right?

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,260
So let's refer to those for now.

172
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,640
That's fine for now.

173
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,700
But this we're going to run through is the measurement process and the functionality

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,120
and how things go into balance, and then ultimately how this affects you and how you can actually

175
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,520
be quote unquote a healer by recommending remedies and how you can come up with remedies,

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
even if you were put into an environment where you're completely unfamiliar, just based on

177
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,700
the way things look, grow, smell, color, touch, feel, all that stuff, right?

178
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,640
Using the senses.

179
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,480
And which I, by the way, I've been doing for almost 30 plus years with people, right?

180
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,460
Just coming up with remedies on things that were in the environment.

181
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,380
And most of the time it works, if you understand what we're going to be talking about tonight.

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,480
So culturally, culturally, it's rather Mediterranean anyway, to use food in order to solve things.

183
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,800
Seems like, you know, I hate to use the phrase food as medicine, but there it is.

184
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,960
It is.

185
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,020
Well, the ancient Egyptians believed that if you were sick, it was because of your diet.

186
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,460
The ancient Greeks and modern Greeks even still believe if you're sick, it's because

187
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,040
of your diet.

188
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,440
They've been brainwashed by the pharmaceutical companies now also.

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,320
I know for sure the Italians believe that also.

190
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,180
When I was growing up, up until the 70s, if you were sick, it was because of your diet.

191
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,740
And that can go on and on and on and pretty much name most cultures nationalities, right?

192
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,080
Yeah, you need to either eat something or stop eating something one or the other quite

193
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,480
often.

194
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,620
So let's get started on this.

195
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,160
So cold is considered a yin energy, very, very yin.

196
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,380
So we have a body of water, which let's not consider if the water is yin or yang.

197
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,300
OK, let's just say we have a body of water and this yin energy known as a lot of cold

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,740
comes to it, which is very, very yin.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,640
And it keeps affecting this body of water.

200
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,060
Now the water in its current state is a fluid and it has density and all that.

201
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
It's not compressible.

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Water is not a good example for this to see because water doesn't have any molecules.

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,260
By the way, I just want to interject this.

204
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,040
If anybody tells you they saw that they draw a molecule of water, even the Ken Wheeler guy

205
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,740
talks about this.

206
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,380
It's all bullshit.

207
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
No one has ever seen a molecule of water.

208
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,900
There is no hex bonding.

209
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,400
It's impossible for water to have a molecule because it's not compressible.

210
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,660
If it was made up of molecules, the interstitial space of the molecule would allow for compression

211
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,440
to take place.

212
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,180
And water is known to be incompressible at 39 degrees, of course.

213
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
It's the only material that will do that.

214
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
So if you had a column, a six foot column in a water and a six foot column of the hardest

215
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,700
steel known to man, you can compress the steel and see it move, but you cannot compress the

216
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,980
water.

217
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,300
You see?

218
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,740
So there's no molecules in water.

219
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,620
That's why I always gave the examples that I do.

220
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,420
So that's another, that's more advanced and I'm beginning to discover that and be able

221
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,480
to back that up with devices here in the near future.

222
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,900
All right.

223
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,880
So you have this water.

224
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,900
It's in a state and you keep hitting it with this yin energy, which is cold, right?

225
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,720
And yin remember is expansive, soft, dark, right?

226
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,620
But the energy is yin.

227
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,100
So it keeps hitting this substance called water.

228
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,400
What does the water do when you keep hitting it with more and more cold?

229
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,080
It gets what?

230
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,460
Hard.

231
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,200
It becomes yang.

232
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,640
Right?

233
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,540
Even regardless if the water is yin and yang itself, it starts to exhibit yang properties.

234
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,200
Becomes hard, right?

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,600
Ice.

236
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,680
Okay.

237
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,340
So we then mistake a mature, an immature person would say, Oh, the water, if yin and yang became

238
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,300
hard, that means that it's hard because of the cold is yang.

239
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,760
No, it's easy to say a lot of beginners make this, this premise that cold is yang.

240
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,400
No, it's yangifying because it's so yin.

241
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:26,200
So what happens is when the substance known as water, which is fluid, it can consider

242
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,120
yin compared to other things, but it's, again, it's not a good example because it's incompressible.

243
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,320
So in reality, water is more yang than the hardest material, harder than diamond.

244
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,980
But anyway, that's another, but I'm using this as a stark example, right?

245
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,160
Another example would be, have you ever seen, they have a vat of liquid nitrogen and they

246
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,780
dip a banana in it and freeze it and then they use it to drive a nail.

247
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,600
There's a lot of videos on that.

248
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,820
And if you take the hammer and dip it in the liquid nitrogen, you try to drive a nail.

249
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,360
What happens?

250
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
The hammer shatters like glass.

251
00:13:59,860 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah.

252
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Yeah.

253
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,020
Okay.

254
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,500
Same principle.

255
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:09,160
If you understand what I just mentioned, what happens here, right now, because the energies

256
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,780
that subject the material, the material always exhibits the opposite.

257
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,020
Okay.

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
Let's give another example.

259
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,580
Anything that goes down into the ground is young.

260
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,060
The roots of a tree and anything that goes up into the sky is yin, right?

261
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,560
But wait a second.

262
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,900
When something is pointy and going up and moving a sharp edge, like the, you know, the edge

263
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,340
of a plant, the front end of a plant that would be young.

264
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,620
Yes.

265
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,460
Because the plant is growing into the yin environment known as the atmosphere, in order

266
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,360
to balance, it starts to develop sharp, hard edges, right?

267
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:46,940
Okay.

268
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,040
Okay.

269
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:55,060
So basically if you apply a yin circumstance to something or a yin energy, you will get

270
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,720
the opposite.

271
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,820
I'll get a young outcome.

272
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,380
And the other way you put a young on it, you'll get a yin outcome.

273
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,420
That's right.

274
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Okay.

275
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,320
So, so let's say you have something like a banana and you have a steel mallet, a wooden

276
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,760
mallet.

277
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,560
Now, which one is more young?

278
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,960
The mallet, the steel mallet is more young or even a wooden mallet than a banana.

279
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,860
It's harder, right?

280
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,380
In it's beginning way, the mallet is way harder.

281
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,920
The banana will get smashed if you try to drive a nail with it, the mallet will smash

282
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,340
the nail.

283
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,640
Okay.

284
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,440
Right.

285
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,800
So, well, but in this case, it's the hard mallet hitting the banana is very, very young,

286
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,260
but it makes the banana even more yin, right?

287
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,620
More yin, it gets splatters everywhere, it's more expanded, right?

288
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,240
Right.

289
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:48,480
So, so in other words, materials exhibit these energies anyway, they're broadcasting it.

290
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,020
Okay.

291
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,000
So let's move forward.

292
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,540
When you look at the water that was affected by a tremendous amount of yin energy, it is

293
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,240
now hard.

294
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,520
So it is broadcasting a young energy to balance the yin energy and itself, the substance has

295
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,280
become young.

296
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,480
So let's go back to the pine needle analogy.

297
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,000
Someone mentioned maybe they'll use pine needles and I made a comment that I'm not sure about

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,200
it.

299
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,740
It doesn't seem like a bad idea if it's, if it's within the climate and geography, the

300
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,700
latitude wise, right?

301
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,940
But pine needles alone, I think they need to be balanced with more things because what

302
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,460
will happen, this is, this is the Testament to the rice.

303
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,800
If you look at the number seven or number eight rice, the reason why I did that is because

304
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,180
it's got all of these things that work together and each one covers a certain base.

305
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,140
Think of it like a baseball diamond.

306
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,040
You have a people in the outfield, left field, right field, and someone's playing each base,

307
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,360
right?

308
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:48,740
Right.

309
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,180
It wouldn't be really baseball if you had one man or two men out in the field, right?

310
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,860
It would be kind of ridiculous because I'll hit the ball where they're not right and watch

311
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,440
them chase it and they'll run out of energy and the game would look really dumb.

312
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,579
It'll just look like a training game, but because there's so many players in the field

313
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,819
and covering different parts of the field with different purposes and skill, it makes

314
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,160
it very interesting, you see?

315
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,780
So when you have a very narrow single thing, let's say that a pine needle, whether, however

316
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,780
you do it, is it tincture or tea or whatever, what will happen is you will get an effect

317
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,500
for it.

318
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:29,340
See, the pine is going towards the yin energy as it goes up, but it's going up into the

319
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,440
yin which itself is manifesting yang.

320
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,920
But it's yang only because of all of the yin that it's going into, right?

321
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,220
So what happens when you have that pine needle, it has this very distinct quality because

322
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,160
also the more easily identifiable something is, the more distinct its quality also, right?

323
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,600
So when you look at a pine needle, it's unmistakable what it is, right?

324
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,280
So also its energy will be very narrow and unmistakable.

325
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,560
It'll be very narrow, right?

326
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,880
You know, this doesn't always hold true because someone gives you some white powder and says,

327
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,480
snort it.

328
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,380
It's not necessarily what you might think it is.

329
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,120
It could be any white.

330
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,540
There's so many white powders, right?

331
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,800
Titanium dioxide.

332
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,060
I just made a pizza tonight.

333
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,860
It could be flour.

334
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,720
It could be soap.

335
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,780
It could be, right?

336
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,140
Right.

337
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,040
Anything from powdered sugar on.

338
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,340
Sure.

339
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,700
Why not?

340
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,120
Yeah.

341
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,460
Sure.

342
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,640
Sure.

343
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,080
Powdered sugar.

344
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,820
But this is also the, actually, there was a funny thing with John Belushi.

345
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,820
You're predicting, remember eating the powdered sugar donut in the end, you would think he

346
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,560
was doing something else.

347
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,180
So we're talking about things that are not processed now.

348
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,900
That's why I brought up that example.

349
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,340
So what happens if you do the pine needle thing, you will have an immediate effect that

350
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,600
is very, let's say, narrow banded.

351
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,200
And of course it helps, you know, if that's what you're looking for and then comprehend

352
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,120
it, right?

353
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,840
So what you would perhaps do in this case is look at the energies that the pine needle

354
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,580
is exhibiting.

355
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,800
They're young, right?

356
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,040
It's narrow, hard, right?

357
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,480
It can take a lot of coal and all that.

358
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,780
But it's only because of that, because the foundation of its purpose of manifesting was

359
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,420
the yin in a colder place of yin environment growing up upwards, right?

360
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,840
You see, into the atmosphere.

361
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:27,780
So the purpose and impetus of its manifestation was yin, the resultant is yang, and you, by

362
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,780
consuming it and how you prepare it, is the effect that you're going to get is going to

363
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,840
be somewhere in the middle.

364
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,640
Always in the middle.

365
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,460
Give me an example.

366
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,240
If you are in a lot of yin energy, very cold, and you take water that has been subjected

367
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,560
to that, you wouldn't be taking liquid water, you'd be taking a piece of ice.

368
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,420
When you subject yourself to that ice, because of your body temperature, a part of it will

369
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,940
start to thaw out immediately, if it's not like super cold, right?

370
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,220
So you'll start to get the balance of the thawed out ice as liquid also.

371
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,100
You won't just have ice, right?

372
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,820
So you're somewhere in the middle, when you throw yourself into the situation.

373
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,440
This is the part that I always want to bring up, and this is maybe people with at least

374
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,820
a few sharpened pencils in their pocket can start putting together what we're saying in

375
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,440
this sonic.

376
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,500
It's never yin or never just yang.

377
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:32,600
It's how this thing came to be, let's say yang, because it was penetrating the yin environment

378
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:40,860
and affected by the yin environment, and when you put a human in there, in the mix, when

379
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,600
that substance, whether it's the energy or the product of that energy, the plant usually,

380
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,780
they're going to get a little bit of both, and you're going to be in between, you see?

381
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:58,340
So what's so fascinating, if this was a simple principle that was, let's say, quote unquote,

382
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,940
in air quotes and brackets, mastered by the Asians, why do they still have practitioners

383
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,260
and doctors they have to go to?

384
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
Because everyone would get it, right?

385
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,580
Everyone, you wouldn't need a doctor, a practitioner to figure it out, or a quote unquote, you know,

386
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,700
medicine person.

387
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,780
So what's going on with these people that are practitioners in this field, especially with

388
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,720
medicines and remedies, and this science is also, in ancient times, if you wanted to be

389
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,020
a weapons builder, come up with a new weapon, you had to understand yin and yang, right?

390
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,060
Or anything, like Da Vinci, people think, you know, Da Vinci, we would know about him

391
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,800
if he did not advertise himself as a weapons designer, right?

392
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,300
That's how he got his funding.

393
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,960
That was one of the main things, yeah.

394
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,360
And that's where the money is, right?

396
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,860
So let's say, so in those days, they had money.

397
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,300
Okay, so the specialty in this is the contemplation and the study.

398
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:06,140
So when you look at something for its quality, you have to also consider who is going to

399
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:12,280
be who's the recipient, their quality, right, what they're trying to do with it.

400
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,120
And typically, what I would suggest, most people look at these remedies is like, okay,

401
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
this is good for this ailment, this is good for that ailment, this is good for this condition

402
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,360
for that, stop doing that, when you're going to learn this.

403
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,760
Never think about in the beginning, do not start thinking about ailments and remedies.

404
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,200
You see, imagine if you were going to affect a perfectly balanced, healthy person with

405
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,440
various different types of intake, right?

406
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,880
And then watch what happens.

407
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,300
You see, meaning yourself, if you want to explain if you, for example, if you're not

408
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,020
in really good shape, physically, health wise, and all that, you shouldn't be messing with

409
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,100
what I'm talking about.

410
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,360
Only people who are in good shape, physical health, and all that should take on what I'm

411
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,560
saying as a task of contemplation, as a task of study, you see, right?

412
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,800
And then when they understand it, and they can see the balance to and fro, and the dynamics,

413
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,260
when then they take on a study and a case study with someone who has this condition,

414
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,320
you will be able to see it very clearly.

415
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,640
But if you yourself, for example, are suffering some ailment or condition, and are trying

416
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,720
to figure out what to do based on this yin and yang principle and using the naturopathy

417
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,280
and all this other stuff, it's going to be extremely difficult.

418
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,920
You got too many things working against you, because the physical condition also works

419
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,540
against the mind, right?

420
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay.

421
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,720
For example, the intestines and the brain look very much the same, right?

422
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
They're in different positions.

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,140
So the intestines or your gut, you know, the gut feeling you can't describe, but it's a

424
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,340
very base feeling, and the brain feeling is more, you can describe more intellectual,

425
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,160
but they're basically the same.

426
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,180
When the body is folded over in the embryo, they come from the same thing.

427
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,260
You know, the first thing that forms when the egg starts to divide, the first feature

428
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,940
before even a zygote is the anus.

429
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,820
So we're one big anus first.

430
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,060
That's why when you call people an asshole, anyway.

431
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,380
Yeah, we were all just assholes.

432
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,280
We were all assholes to begin with.

433
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,220
We were all asshole all in the beginning.

434
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,660
Everyone was all asshole.

435
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,380
So anyway, crazy, right?

436
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,000
Going forward, when you have someone that has intestinal problems, they can't think clearly

437
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,680
and vice versa.

438
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,520
If someone doesn't think clearly, eventually they have stomach problems.

439
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,140
Oh, you ever wonder why so many Americans have stomach problems?

440
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,660
How could they think clearly with their education and what they watch on TV and take in a church

441
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,620
or a radio, right?

442
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,380
Well, stomach and back is what I always hear.

443
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,220
Stomach and back.

444
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,680
Stomach and back is complicated because there's so many functions there.

445
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,580
There's actually things that can develop in the body, forms of fungus that are so powerful,

446
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,280
they will form a ring around the vertebrae and crush the vertebrae.

447
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,560
So that's another thing.

448
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,460
I don't know if you guys ever...

449
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,400
Anyway, medical study is incredible, by the way, because anything can happen based on

450
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,380
the conditions changing.

451
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,740
Like, for example, before being subject...

452
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,400
Right now, it's pretty easy to be subject to radioactive high doses of radiation.

453
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,360
Very easy for that to happen.

454
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,240
We're not just talking about people who are targeted to be taken out that way.

455
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,280
But if you went back into the past, it was a very rare occurrence.

456
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,260
Right?

457
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,240
I mean, now you could rig a microwave door open and perhaps put it near someone and they'll

458
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,660
get...

459
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,060
They don't know what happened.

460
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,560
They go to the medical and they'll say, you have all the things of radiation, microwave

461
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,720
poisoning, right?

462
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,140
All that, right?

463
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,900
That's very rare.

464
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,100
If you went back to 300 years, that was unheard of.

465
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,420
Right.

466
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,340
You see?

467
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,740
So that's what I mean.

468
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,120
The human body is constantly changing.

469
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,760
And the stuff that you're seeing what people are going through now are 100% based on their

470
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,120
environment.

471
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,320
All these cancers, all these diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure.

472
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,420
Actually, the ones I mentioned do not exist.

473
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,240
There's just a form of communication.

474
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,560
By the way, you know what?

475
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,160
No one has ever gotten ill from diabetes.

476
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,340
Only the people that receive treatment for it, right?

477
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,880
I think you understand that too, right?

478
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,160
Yeah.

479
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,580
Most people don't understand that.

480
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,400
Most people get tested and they have low blood sugar and they keep sending you letters and

481
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,880
phone calls.

482
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,400
You know, you were diagnosed...

483
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,180
Not you have anything.

484
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,440
You were diagnosed with a possible serious condition.

485
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,520
You should consider treatment.

486
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,020
Of course, there's nothing wrong with you, right?

487
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,220
They need business, right?

488
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,480
So it's kind of like the guys here with window tint.

489
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,540
Oh, you don't have tint on your windows in Arizona.

490
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,700
You need to get some window tint to make it sound real important.

491
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,540
You don't have windshield insurance.

492
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,960
You know how many rocks and grout, right?

493
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,400
You know, people are like, oh my gosh.

494
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Yeah.

495
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,400
You know, it sounds right.

496
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,500
It sounds pretty convincing.

497
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,480
So the same with AIDS and all this other stuff.

498
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,300
Cancer is the same.

499
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,440
The problem is that some people, you know, you'll hear a lot of stories.

500
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,180
Well, they didn't get diagnosed early enough and they died of cancer.

501
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,100
Well, yeah.

502
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,720
Well, you know, because they just kept ignoring.

503
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,440
You know, it's a certain lifestyle, right?

504
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,080
That brought it on, right?

505
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,040
So again, I didn't focus much on too many examples, but I don't think too many examples

506
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,720
are necessary.

507
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,840
You can go through the third or first or second grade level chart of yin and yang.

508
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,500
And those energies will always manifest the opposite in material form.

509
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,060
And you are always somewhere in the middle.
