1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,760
56, and let's hit the ground running.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,560
How about that?

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,680
Greek.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,920
Interesting thing.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,180
I brought up just before we started to record, but now we are recording.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,660
So let's get it on the record, so to speak, right?

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,720
Although, you know what?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,660
Records have made a comeback.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,260
But anyway, I'm going all over the place.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,180
I don't want to do that.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,840
Well, anything you could access later as a record.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,480
True enough.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,560
But I'm thinking of LPs, you know, vinyl, stuff like that, like those came back around

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,060
recently.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,760
You're overthinking it.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,420
Yeah, of course I am, because that's what I do a lot of times.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,820
Anyways.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,560
Weird thing.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,320
I mentioned to you just before we went to air, though, that because you'd played a piece

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,180
of music in the background.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,940
A lot of times I call you up and you're listening to music, and I love some of the music, almost

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,980
every type of music I love to hear.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,100
Anyway, you were listening to an unusual piece, and it ended up in a discussion about who

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,019
this lady was that was singing.

25
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:08,600
Not really relevant to get into particulars, but we ended up saying, well, you know, old

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,100
men can always have babies, it seems like, except in very recent times.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,780
It seems like sperm counts are down.

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,600
The ability to reproduce is just down in general.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,620
It's definitely discouraged, but physiologically it seems to have dropped off as well.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,880
So, you know, what are your thoughts on that?

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,860
Why is that happening?

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
How about the why of it?

33
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,380
Well, I talked about it a long time ago.

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,380
It's the revived goddess religion, which will be coming in your face, but the revived goddess

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,120
religion is about things not being, well, the way things are wrong, and things should

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,720
be different.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,320
In other words, procreation should not happen the way it is, right?

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,320
It should be technological.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,980
The fake wombs, men having babies.

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,900
Well, let me ask you this, because you're saying it's going to be in our face.

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
Do you mean that it's going to be very much mainstreamed and that that's going to become

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,020
like...

43
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,639
It has been, well, tangentially it's been mainstreamed for over 75 years, 50 years.

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,480
Started with in vitro fertilization when there were public announcements about being able

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,100
to inseminate or create, you know, copulate without, you know, the natural standard way.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,020
But I mean them pushing it as a standard religion, not necessarily all of the accoutrements or

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,740
so that they've all put into play here that all go along with it that are obvious if you're

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,340
paying attention.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,080
But I mean directly, is there going to be like, hey, we've established the goddess religion

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,640
and you should come join it?

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
It's not going to be like that.

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,940
No, no.

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,200
What happens is that it's just like, look at the terrorism thing, right?

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
How do they do that?

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,700
They show it to you in movies first, and then there's like little incidents here and there.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,200
And then they start using the word more, more often where it wasn't used before.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,740
Right.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,140
Then you have one big event.

59
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,520
Boom.

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,160
And now it's suddenly, now this is the mainstream.

61
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,760
It's a clash of cultures.

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,600
It's survival.

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,880
If you want to survive, you got to fight them over here so you don't have to fight them

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,120
over.

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,180
Well, you got to fight them over there.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,140
So fight them over here.

67
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,480
And didn't they pass a whole bunch of legislation and stuff after Kennedy?

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,360
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,520
About assassinations and about this and that and plot codes and right.

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Well, the next thing you knew is that there was this, you know, rage to turn out what

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,740
the intelligence agencies were doing and how they were seeking to assassinate foreign leaders

72
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,220
and everything.

73
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,060
And that became a movement in and of itself.

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,580
Coincidentally, even though there was just one lone nut guy that apparently shot him,

75
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,840
according to the government conclusion.

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
But yeah, that's exactly what happened.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,240
You know, again, pay attention to what they're doing, not necessarily what they're saying.

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,580
So so you mean to say the same thing with the goddess religion?

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,560
It's just like that.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,860
It's not about what they're going to say.

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,780
But the playbook is the same.

82
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,960
It's the same tension.

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,160
You'll have it introduced in the minds and in language, in the society.

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,340
And then you'll have tension and then you'll have an event.

85
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,280
And then the event is the catalyst for putting in something new.

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,180
And then, of course, and then, of course, the problem reaction solution where it's like,

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,940
here's the problem. It was already there.

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,680
Now we're going to let you react to it.

89
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,200
And now we're going to give you a solution, even though it's a little loose

90
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
interpretation of the Hegelian dialectic.

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,600
It is useful because that's exactly the way it goes.

92
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,620
So technologically, you need answers because men are failing.

93
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,880
They're not reproducing.

94
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,160
People aren't reproducing.

95
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,520
We're not replacing ourselves.

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,220
So here's the artificial you don't even have to go that deep.

97
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,280
OK, it's we're in it.

98
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,080
We're in a script and the script has to play out a certain way.

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,440
And like I've been saying for a long time, there's only a few real people on the planet.

100
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,920
And everyone, you know how Shakespeare said the whole world's a stage, right?

101
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,500
Well, imagine a film.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
You know, you've got your protagonist, antagonist, the star, wherever.

103
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,640
You've got a handful of characters that are on the bill.

104
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,480
And then you've got you can have a movie with, I think, was it Close Encounters

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,960
of Third Kind had a no, it was Gandhi that had a quarter of a million extras.

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,220
Right. It showed up for the film.

107
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,460
That was the world record, right?

108
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,500
Yeah, yeah. It was a huge scene where they had the yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,040
Yeah. So you could.

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,980
So when you most of the people could be friends, family, your boss,

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,260
they are not real people.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,460
In other words, they're here to help.

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
You know, you can't have a theater that the script and the screenplay

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
has multitudes and populations without supplying the multitudes

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
and populations as extras. Right.

116
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,340
So here's the interesting part.

117
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,500
There's only even, you know, there's always been a very tiny percentage

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,100
of the human population that is actually really human.

119
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,900
And when the script changes, you have a big war.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,740
Kill off everyone or a big disease.

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
You kill off everyone. Right. Right.

122
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
You see how it works.

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,460
It's very simple.

124
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,840
So the whole thing here is especially what I've been doing

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,940
is trying to address the real people that are here.

126
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,360
And it's always been this way, by the way.

127
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,700
It's always been this way.

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,760
And who are they?

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,700
And part of the mystic mysticism, by the way,

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,140
if the mystic, if the mystics are correct and they've always been correct,

131
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,180
you know, all the ancient mystics, even the modern ones, the good ones.

132
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,580
There's nothing to ever worry about. Right.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,700
So, you know, or take anything to the point where that was

134
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,820
I was going to say, take it to heart.

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,260
You should always take everything to heart because without heart, there's nothing.

136
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,000
Right. So, yeah, it'll be interesting.

137
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,260
And we're coming up in the next few years that I was been talking about.

138
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll have to organize my thoughts.

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,020
Also, I've been studying the chronology of the stuff.

140
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,800
Again, archaics puts out, you know, Texas, Texas country meets Internet.

141
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,160
Right, right. And he's got he's done some very good work.

142
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,160
And here's the thing.

143
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
If I'm incorrect or not sure, I'll tell you, hey,

144
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,020
if I was sure about something and not sure now, I'll tell you, you know,

145
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,940
I'm not invested in any of this.

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,060
The the whole reason I've always done the Greek speak

147
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,500
is because I was looking for other people to jam with.

148
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,580
Ergo, that's why we're just doing this little pitly,

149
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,640
you know, behind a paywall or whatever.

150
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,620
Otherwise, it would have been a YouTube channel like everybody else 10 years ago.

151
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,320
Right. Right.

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,100
And, you know, and be driving around a Mercedes, a new Mercedes

153
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,200
like everybody else's who's doing these things.

154
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,560
And that's you know, it's I'm just I'm being sarcastic. Right.

155
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,340
So I'm not that's not I'm looking for people to jam with. Right. Right.

156
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,160
So it's interesting.

157
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,080
Recently, I got something very much appreciated email from someone about the

158
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,220
you know, if you're selling these magnetic devices, you should check out the patent.

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
So they did a lot of work.

160
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
They did. I was very grateful.

161
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,780
Hopefully, I'll get more in touch with this individual.

162
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,140
To show me. So I went through all these patents and nothing is even resembling

163
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,540
clothes, because I think I mentioned once this is a tangent, but it's pertinent.

164
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,620
Console's C.O.M.

165
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,120
S.O.L. is like one of the state of the art computer

166
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,180
designing software for engineers

167
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,260
and entered pretty much all the parameters of what I'm doing.

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,420
And it showed nothing.

169
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,920
That's one of those things.

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,940
That's one of those things that you can create models and it'll show you, OK,

171
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,800
if I add this element, this action, this thing to this device or this building

172
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
or whatever. Yeah, actually, you go to the for example, you go to the category

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
of magnets, you put the shape of your magnet and the power in the gauss

174
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,500
and I'll show you the field.

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,720
They didn't show any of the fields that I'm working with at all.

176
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,640
Not even considered.

177
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,040
Right. So right away, if someone tries to imitate this from an engineering

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,360
perspective, say, oh, we're not going to bother copying because it doesn't work.

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
But what do you mean it doesn't work?

180
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,780
We put dirty water on one side and clean water comes out the other.

181
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,260
What's wrong?

182
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,880
So I'll just leave the whole thing alone.

183
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,160
It's too crazy. This is how they are, you know.

184
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,039
So so the the part of the magnet that I'm using is not acknowledged

185
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,580
and it's called the block wall, which is not a wall.

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,539
Right. Well, walls don't move on their own.

187
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,340
So if you take a magnet, you know, between the North and South Pole

188
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,460
is the block wall, right?

189
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
They're calling it right.

190
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,360
But if you break that or if you stack another magnet next to it,

191
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,180
it acts like one magnet.

192
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,600
Then the block wall moves to where the two magnets are joined,

193
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,620
not the center of each.

194
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,380
So it's not it's not a wall at all.

195
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,080
So I can't really gives a pretty good explanation.

196
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,640
He's a little limited.

197
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,000
And I have not shared what I'm doing with him, by the way.

198
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,780
He's on his own path.

199
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,560
And I think he would be very frustrated to show him what I'm working on,

200
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,260
because I could see that I could see it would take a lot of flexibility

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,840
for him to to come over and see what I'm doing.

202
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,000
But nonetheless, I was very appreciative individual looking out for me

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
because, you know, to go to start searching patents over

204
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,260
and send someone a whole bunch of stuff is a lot of work.

205
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,860
So I do always appreciate the work that people do and the messages that I get.

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,640
But I'm still looking for a group of people.

207
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,020
But I know, look, spiritually, it's not possible,

208
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,380
because if you have too many people that are alike, right,

209
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,740
and you start doing things that are so simple but yet extraordinary,

210
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,780
you become a danger. Right. Right.

211
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
So and not that I'm you know, it's not me.

212
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,900
It's what the stuff that I work on is is just, you know, extraordinary.

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,840
And history tells us this.

214
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,280
I mean, how many stories do you have to hear of somebody who heals somebody

215
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,160
and the next thing you know, they're a witch, you know,

216
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,900
and they get treated as such.

217
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Let's say you put five healers in a room that, you know, that's

218
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,600
call the F-16 and drop a bomb and say a gas line exploded. Right. Right.

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,740
And, you know, I mean, I've actually got a thing in my family line

220
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,760
that happened like that with my my great grandmother.

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
That's exactly how my Irish ancestors ended up here

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,000
because they fled after something like that.

223
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,440
And all she did was use some basic knowledge.

224
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,940
Was she a widow? Yes.

225
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Yeah, that's what they do.

226
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,120
They typically target widows and they call them a witch

227
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,260
so they could take their property.

228
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,820
But exactly. And once that happened, it was like somebody take the kids

229
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,980
and send them to America because, you know, or actually Canada directly

230
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
so that, you know, they don't get killed also.

231
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
And that's that's how my Irish blood got here.

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
But, you know, just saying it's just an interesting thing to me

233
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,540
because this is what happens when you take something that's not really extraordinary.

234
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm very sure she used some very simple things and healed someone.

235
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,500
Sure. True.

236
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,340
You know, as far as everybody else was concerned, he's dead.

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,680
He's going to die. That's the end of it.

238
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,760
Well, I want to get into that, by the way, because it's it's not you're not really

239
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
you're enabling something that that, you know, it's kind of like

240
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,500
you walk in a room and the room is flooding in New York City, by the way.

241
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,960
A little pun there, you know, and everybody's complaining about it.

242
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,640
And you look over and you see the tap is open.

243
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
You go and close the tap and everyone's like, oh, that's amazing.

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
What do you mean? That's amazing.

245
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,020
That's so simple, right?

246
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,840
It's a simple answer to at least, you know, stop the increase on the problem.

247
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,740
You know, so, right.

248
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,620
So, yeah, these things are, you know, but if you don't see it

249
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,700
and you can't correlate the two, it's not going to happen.

250
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,280
But I want to get into the body a little bit.

251
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Now, there was some stuff in the chat.

252
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,760
And someone is pretty much putting personal information out

253
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,880
that I think will help everyone.

254
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,360
There's there's what they call a long time ago.

255
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,060
Someone said, Tim, when we're talking about personal substance, that's TMI.

256
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,000
I said, what the hell is TMI?

257
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,020
But it's like too personal, right? Too much information.

258
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,060
Right. But nothing like that.

259
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,700
I actually it's very appreciated because it's in one of the purposes

260
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,800
of some people going through what they're going through

261
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
is so others can learn from it. Right. Right.

262
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,140
If they can communicate it.

263
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,240
And the purpose of life is to be alive.

264
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,060
There's no other purpose, by the way.

265
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,980
So once you understand that and your give

266
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,580
or should factor is really low, you start to experience

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,920
more and more of what it means to be here.

268
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,480
So, by the way, what happens if your give or should factor is too high?

269
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,080
In general, you become a stressed out individual, right?

270
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,300
Absolutely. Throughout history. Yes.

271
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,600
Yeah. Not just this society, any society.

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,200
So your give or should factor has to be low.

273
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,140
If your give or should factor is low,

274
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,720
it doesn't mean you don't do good work.

275
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
You can work in like, you know, protect Philippe or Seiko watches,

276
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,880
you know, very expensive watch Rolex factory.

277
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,180
And you have a low give or should factor overall.

278
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,260
But when you're building the watches,

279
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,840
you build them how they're supposed to be built. Right.

280
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,820
Don't mix that up. Right.

281
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,560
So when you cook a meal, it's the best meal you could possibly make.

282
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,940
Right. Anything you do is still the best possible.

283
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,600
But your overall give or should factor is low. Right.

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,620
So that's that's the key to being here and to experience life.

285
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,800
So I want to get into because this person put personal information.

286
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,760
This is very helpful in his personal experience.

287
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,000
And also, you know, he's benefiting from a lot of the things that are being said here.

288
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,520
What I want to put out, though,

289
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,780
there was a concern about the body type and the body changing or not. OK.

290
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,060
One thing I haven't discussed and I'm always assessing people this way.

291
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,280
You have two minds.

292
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,360
You have, you know, not not in the way people say, always dual minded. Right.

293
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,380
Because, you know, it's not good.

294
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,460
No, you have two minds within the housing.

295
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,040
And I've never gotten into this much.

296
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,420
But you know how I define the spirit as the personality,

297
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
the intangible information, very unique to you.

298
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,940
And there's the soul, which is the living physical metabolism.

299
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
And then there's the body.

300
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,860
Well, the soul and the body is the living aspect

301
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,320
that has a very, very basic mind of its own.

302
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,820
It doesn't have us. It has a spirit, a component.

303
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,500
But it's not very unique, like the one that you that makes you you.

304
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,880
Like I said, your soul is your metabolism.

305
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,620
So the metabolism from person to person changes slightly.

306
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,580
But generally, you're attached to a general field, a biological field,

307
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,360
a spiritual field that keeps that metabolism going.

308
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,400
Part of that is what we call the involuntary movements. Right. Right.

309
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,300
That's where that's where a similar shape participate

310
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,980
in similar behaviors, react similarly to no, no, not even that.

311
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,540
I mean, the body's will to live.

312
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,080
OK, OK. The body has a will to live.

313
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,340
And this is further along right now.

314
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,880
So let's say someone's really unhappy with the world.

315
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,820
They want to check out.

316
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,940
So they decide they're going to drown themselves.

317
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,760
Well, while they're drowning themselves, they're quite,

318
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,980
you know, adamant about doing that.

319
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,300
And they're they feel a sense of achievement achievement

320
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,660
because once the drowning is done, they're done and they can check out. Right.

321
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,620
But while they're drowning themselves, the body's mind,

322
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,300
the body's own little thing that keeps that desire to live doesn't want to drown.

323
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,300
Right. And it's like, what are you doing to me?

324
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,220
What are you doing to me? Don't drown me. Right. Right.

325
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,700
It doesn't even have a voice. It's totally silent.

326
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,580
But you will feel

327
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,880
the person that's doing that will be satisfied

328
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,140
and feel like they're accomplishing something of one side, the spirit,

329
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,180
the main spirit, but the secondary spirit will be trying to stay alive.

330
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,740
OK, so when someone is unconscious from a bullet,

331
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,160
you see this in Hollywood movies, they're unconscious.

332
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,640
They're really messed up, you know, hit by a car, shot by a gun, whatever, whatever.

333
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
And they have them on the hospital bed.

334
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,100
You see this and their heart is still beating and they're still alive,

335
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,780
but they're unconscious.

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,240
And what are the doctor? What do they say?

337
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,360
The medical people, this guy's a real fighter.

338
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,840
He really wants to stay alive. Right.

339
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
What do you mean? How do you know the guy hasn't said a word?

340
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,100
You know, he's been unconscious for three days.

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,680
How do you know?

342
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,140
Because they're measuring what the body is doing.

343
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,260
Right. And the body has its desire to stay alive, even if you're unconscious.

344
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,640
Right. So that part of the body is something that I've not talked about.

345
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,460
And that is very similar.

346
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,800
Like everyone's body.

347
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,940
OK, so imagine you have the most suicidal, most depressed person

348
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,580
that's ready to go ahead and do this or whatever to take themselves out.

349
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,640
The body doesn't want to be taken next.

350
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,000
The body is here to wants to live as much as possible.

351
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,860
Now, there are some exceptions when people do pass

352
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,260
and the body is like he's ready to go and he just went peacefully.

353
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,760
You say, well, I was just going to ask, doesn't it go the other way?

354
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,660
Where sometimes, look, the body's done.

355
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,300
And no matter what it is, you want sure you ain't sticking around.

356
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,460
And it's not fighting.

357
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,340
It's not fighting anymore to stick around.

358
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
It wants to go. Right.

359
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,420
OK. It also does that.

360
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,280
But generally and most active people, the general consensus,

361
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,500
the general condition for everyone is

362
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,180
regardless of your whatever, you have an innate ability.

363
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,500
The body has its own thing.

364
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,420
OK, I use this very often.

365
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,380
The human body has its own innate desires and abilities.

366
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,819
Like if you if you see something coming towards you,

367
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,560
someone's going to throw a punch, you flinch, right?

368
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,819
Yeah, typically. Right.

369
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,000
That you don't think about these involuntary.

370
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,260
OK, so various animals have similar things.

371
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,940
For example, like a cat,

372
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,900
you have many different personalities of cats,

373
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,980
but when something drops real loud in the room, they all just take off

374
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,740
and they run away, then they stop and look right.

375
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,720
That's the cat body.

376
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
They have no control over that. Right.

377
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,340
The same thing with a dog has its own tendencies.

378
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,560
A bird has different tendencies when it's startled, let's say,

379
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,460
how the way it reacts.

380
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,740
And they're all very, very similar.

381
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,180
That's this innate ability that it's like built in

382
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,640
the uniqueness that each body of each creature has.

383
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,860
Even plants have this.

384
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,940
You know, the most innate thing for a plant is to move towards the light.

385
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
Right. You know, it bends towards it.

386
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,480
And if it gets too much light, it droops. Right.

387
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,200
It's to move away.

388
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,860
But it doesn't move away from the light.

389
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,840
It just goes downward.

390
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,460
So everything alive has this innate ability to continue living

391
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,120
unless, you know, there's some exceptions when they've had enough.

392
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,760
OK, so that aspect now,

393
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,980
when when you have a certain mindset

394
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,600
that says, well, I'm going through some physical challenges

395
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,920
and what or I want to change the way I look or feel or whatever,

396
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,560
and the body doesn't react the way I expect it to or it's not reacting.

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,580
OK, that's OK. That's OK.

398
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,820
The first thing you have to consider is quality of life.

399
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,840
Am I constantly in pain?

400
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,640
Right. Right.

401
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,020
That's a big deal. Yeah.

402
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,240
Because that brings other for you don't want to suffer that.

403
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,020
And that's by the way, the medical industry has done nothing

404
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,900
for humanity and like they tout it. Right.

405
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,040
It's like police keep you safe. Are you kidding?

406
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,520
They are the ones that are running all the criminal.

407
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,440
And they're part of the criminal enterprise.

408
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,800
They just have the illusion. Right.

409
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,040
Or the military. Right. You see all this stuff.

410
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,220
So no medical isn't done anything. OK.

411
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,700
If you start looking, I've looked at this over since the 80s.

412
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,860
I was when I go to the main library in New York City,

413
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,600
no one's with the lions outside.

414
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,060
You know, when they sat in the same place, Tesla used to sit.

415
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,460
I didn't even know. But OK,

416
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,360
I've been looking at this stuff, the medical stuff since then,

417
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,880
in the late 80s and in real libraries with books that were from the 1800s.

418
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,280
And what I found fascinating is cause of death

419
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,960
in 17, 18, 19, early 20th centuries.

420
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,200
Causes of death were number one, by the way,

421
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,480
that I found that just not statistically, but the one that I found

422
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,040
that was called on the death certificates, it was called poisoning of the teeth.

423
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,600
Like, you know, you know, Woolworth, he died of that.

424
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,520
You know, the guy who started Woolworth. Yeah. OK.

425
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,520
Why would they put that on death certificate?

426
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,720
Well, because there was no quote unquote dental care.

427
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,360
People were not good at pulling teeth.

428
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,020
People didn't want teeth pulled.

429
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
There was oral infections, poor diet.

430
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,540
Right. Because right.

431
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,360
You know, financial system.

432
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,960
You remember, everyone's familiar with the Depression in 1929.

433
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,880
The Great Depression.

434
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,800
Well, there was a Great Depression in the 1870s.

435
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,740
It was a Great Depression in the 1890s.

436
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,860
You don't hear about those too much, right?

437
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,760
Another one was pretty rough in 1907, you know, just.

438
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,060
Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,060
There was a collapse of all securities and all that.

440
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,760
They were free. Right.

441
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,500
So these are these very, very bad.

442
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,560
OK, so financial stress.

443
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,440
And so the other thing I found was cholera, diphtheria.

444
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,140
A lot of people die to that, which is what you get that.

445
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,400
Those are things that are living in water because the people

446
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,780
just got used to parasites are thought to be right.

447
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,200
Pretty much. And they were.

448
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah. These things will eat you alive.

449
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,980
Basically, that's what they do.

450
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,120
They they make a comfortable spot on the inside of the body and they nest

451
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,960
literally. And then when they make their young, they have a life cycle

452
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,420
and that life cycle continues and they drill holes in your body.

453
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,020
Right. And you can see this if you if you've ever been around.

454
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,980
They overeat and then the body fails.

455
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,040
That's basically the holes in the liver are very calm.

456
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,800
Like if you go if you're a hunter.

457
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,940
Right. I mean, if you've ever shot an animal, hung it, you know, addressed it,

458
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,760
you know, it cooled down and then finally butchered it and all that.

459
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,920
And you look at the organs, you'll see holes through the organs, you know,

460
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,460
especially the liver, especially. Right.

461
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,280
OK, so that by the way, making a hole in your liver

462
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,960
or five or six or 10 holes in your liver hurts, you know,

463
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,600
it causes infection on that.

464
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,460
But anyway, this is in nature also. So

465
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,820
I found the causes of death to be basically hygienic

466
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
and dentistry and real just basic stuff,

467
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,340
not these drugs, vaccines or methods or nothing, nothing like that.

468
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,480
And the other one and certainly not the cop out we have now,

469
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
which is almost always what cardiac arrest.

470
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,340
That's it. I mean, which is.

471
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,920
Yeah. But your blood's OK.

472
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,880
Basically, if your blood's too thin, you're going to have a cardiac arrest,

473
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,580
just like if the the the the the heart is a braking mechanism.

474
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,740
So I don't know if you're familiar with drum breaks, you know,

475
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,740
from the cars in the 70s, if you're in the rain, you know, you hit them.

476
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,480
And it seems like the more you it seems like sometimes if you leave,

477
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,900
if the drum breaks are really wet, the more you lean on them,

478
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,720
it seems like you're going faster. Right.

479
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
It seems like they're not doing anything right.

480
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah. Very much like a heart attack. Yeah.

481
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,840
I'm just so I'm just old enough to remember that in driving manuals,

482
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,140
they used to talk about having to pump the brakes because we had to drive them.

483
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,240
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's like a wiper.

484
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,780
Yeah. So you don't trap a hydro of the water between the

485
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,140
caliper and the rotor. Right. Let's say exactly where the drum.

486
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,600
So, OK. So basically, the other thing was shock.

487
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,460
Basically, someone gets run over by a horse carriage

488
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,920
and they die within an hour, not because of their injuries,

489
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,660
because of fright and pain.

490
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,500
Right. OK. OK.

491
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,980
Shock to the body. Basically, they go into shock.

492
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,140
I've seen people go in shock. It's the most amazing thing.

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,760
It's as I have you ever seen a baby being born?

494
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,560
Yes. It comes out. It's like white, gray, bluish.

495
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,660
You're right. Yes. Right.

496
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,140
And when it takes as soon as it takes its first breath, it doesn't always cry.

497
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,160
It turns flesh tone in like five seconds.

498
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,580
It looks it looks purplish to me when it comes out my vision.

499
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,040
But yes. Yeah, it depends on the. Yeah, it looks great.

500
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,560
It looks like a cadaver. Right.

501
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,120
OK, so when someone goes into shock,

502
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,540
they are flesh tone and then they look like a cadaver within 30 seconds.

503
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,120
They lose. They turn completely pale and gray.

504
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,860
Yeah. The whole turning white deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,760
So that's what people die from.

506
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,120
You know, basically, I ran into a lot of fatalities in New York

507
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,600
where you get run by a car, run over by a carriage, horse carriage.

508
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,600
Right. It's pretty normal. Right.

509
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,220
Common injury. Yeah. Yeah. Falls. Falls.

510
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,860
Also, they didn't have guardrails and stuff like that in places.

511
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,900
So and the people, the injuries were minor, you know,

512
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,240
but they died of shock from pain.

513
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,500
So anyway, so what has happened was there was a just like I did

514
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,660
that analysis for myself, that analysis has been going on, you know,

515
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,880
since the industry, the medical industry has been around.

516
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,080
And they said, well, we need more dentists and we need some good painkillers.

517
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,480
That are easily available and easily administered and effective and cheap.

518
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,360
All those things. OK, there you go.

519
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Then the main thing was water.

520
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,200
There was a big cholera.

521
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,760
A lot of people dying in England for for decades and centuries

522
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,800
because the freshwater was too close to the sewer water.

523
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,940
And when they brought in the Prussian engineers, they looked at that

524
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,960
and they said, oh, you got the cholera outbreak in London

525
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,740
because your freshwater is too close to your sewer water.

526
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,300
Why don't you separate them by a few hundred feet?

527
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,460
Watch what happens.

528
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,340
Duh. Right.

529
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,240
So, OK, so we have water, even though there's stuff in the water,

530
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,460
you know, whatever, you know, they put chemicals in there.

531
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,980
It's still far away from the sewer line.

532
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,840
You know, in some places, you know, the water, you know,

533
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,700
the water comes in next to the sewer line.

534
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,980
It's distinctly separate.

535
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,040
It would be better if there were more separate.

536
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,940
But OK, so it's basically hygiene and painkillers and dentistry.

537
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,440
You know, it's funny how the dentists, you know, they don't know much.

538
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,880
And I say, you know, it's because you people are living longer.

539
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,300
And he's like, oh, I didn't know that.

540
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
I mean, you know, of course they wouldn't, you know,

541
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,860
talk about anything meaningful in school.

542
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,860
No, I would. Yeah. Yeah.

543
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,360
So, OK, so that's basically this is like a long maybe tangent.

544
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,820
But the cause of death and what I've looked into right and all this.

545
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,260
And OK, so when you look forward, the body's desire to live

546
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,540
if the quality of life is good,

547
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,660
you're fine, right, especially if the quality of life.

548
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
OK, like, for example,

549
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,560
from being knocked around and being in like bike crashes and stuff like that,

550
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,340
if certain times of the year, my shoulder hurts from a previous injury.

551
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,820
Right. You know, you've heard of that, right.

552
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,020
Or whatever. And, you know, certain things like that.

553
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,720
I haven't heard of it. Yeah. But OK.

554
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah. But I mean, you've heard people have, you know, been certain that,

555
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,520
you know, had an injury and you kind of, you know,

556
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,540
conscious of that area for the rest of your life.

557
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,220
And absolutely. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I like I said, I live it.

558
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
So, yeah. Right.

559
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,140
So if someone jumped into your body that wasn't familiar with this,

560
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
you would find that unusual, maybe uncomfortable,

561
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,780
but because you've gotten used to it, it's OK.

562
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,860
Oh, you've justified it. Yeah.

563
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,800
Somebody jumped in my body. They'd be going, holy crap.

564
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,060
Why does my back hurt like that?

565
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,760
And it's like, no, that's just. Yeah.

566
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,360
But you've justified it. So the history makes it better.

567
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,800
OK, so exactly the same.

568
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,920
There is social pressure, personal pressure.

569
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,540
I mean, like I've talked about sex, sex is one of the things

570
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,000
that is based on what your culture is.

571
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,180
Right. Sex is for having children.

572
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,740
That's it pretty much.

573
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,080
And then you have the desire, of course, and all that, you know.

574
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,920
And then the rest of that is based on what culture you're in. Right.

575
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,140
And, you know, I was having a conversation with someone recently

576
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,460
and I was like, you know, life kind of sucks.

577
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,100
You know, I've had enough. It's not that I'm complaining because I just

578
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,240
you just need a good party with.

579
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,480
You just need to go to a party with lots of sex and drugs.

580
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,840
And you'll find it. Yeah. Once a year.

581
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,920
But it has to be a memorable.

582
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,060
Like you ever go to a party that you remember for a year or two after.

583
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,740
Right. Everyone should have a party like that.

584
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,360
It's called, you know, Saturnalia Christmas was like that, by the way.

585
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,520
It was it was basically a big it doesn't have to be an orgy or whatever.

586
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,360
But in other words, within the moral framework that you so prescribed

587
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,860
subscribe to, you know, have a really good party

588
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,220
at least once a year or once a month or once a year, I think is enough.

589
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,640
In other words, you say once a month, you know, kill you.

590
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,500
If it's really a good party and do it once a month,

591
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,360
they'll kill you after the third month, let's say. Right.

592
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,180
So you don't want so everyone should enjoy something

593
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,980
at least once a year that is just rocking like it just, you know,

594
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,400
they call it Saturnalia Christmas.

595
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,880
That's like the most popular thing.

596
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,120
You know, even in the middle of summer, it's Christmas in July.

597
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,660
Remember Crazy Eddie or whatever? Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah.

598
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,160
So that was Saturnalia.

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,360
So the thing. Yeah. So basically, you know, the reason I'm bringing this up

600
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,660
and the sex thing and all that is because it's whatever culture you're in again.

601
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,140
Right. You know, the way you look, the way you might think your appearance fits.

602
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,020
Like, for example, since the 80s.

603
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,640
OK, if you go back and look at advertisements

604
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,240
on the 20s, 30s and 40s, they were ads on there for skinny girls.

605
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,280
You know, you're skinny. Nobody wants you.

606
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,660
You got to gain weight or the chubby girls are getting, you know, the attraction.

607
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Well, in the 80s with the swimsuit models, it's like they're like

608
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
they look like 12 year old boys, real skinny.

609
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,480
Yeah. You know, if I see a skinny, skinny woman like that,

610
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,920
it's like not attractive at all.

611
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,900
It's like, oh, my gosh, go the other way.

612
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
Yeah. I'm not a skinny guy either.

613
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They got to have, you know, meat.

614
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,740
So, yeah. Tick.

615
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,460
There's thick and there's tick.

616
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,620
So, yeah. And this was the consensus for a very long time.

617
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,580
If a woman was skinny, it was considered she was unhealthy.

618
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,700
Right now, if a woman's not skinny, it's considered unhealthy.

619
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
So the culture can make you mad.

620
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,120
I mean, mad, mad, meaning crazy and mad, meaning like, yeah, I'm mad about that.

621
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Right. It'll piss you off because it might shift on you when you, you know,

622
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,900
hey, look, I'm clearly in good shape now.

623
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,400
But hey, in a couple of years, when I was 25, 30 years ago,

624
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,180
so many women, I'd say, oh, I'm so upset.

625
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,840
Why upset? Because I'm fat. I'm looking at her.

626
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,060
She's she could use about five or ten more pounds.

627
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,820
You're upset because you're fat.

628
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,220
What are you talking about?

629
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
You're actually about 10, 15 pounds underweight.

630
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,980
Oh, my gosh. This is insane.

631
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,320
You see. So, yeah. So.

632
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,080
So, OK, so this stuff don't get caught. Right.

633
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,660
So the whole thing then ends up in quality of life.

634
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,480
All right. Health. What is health?

635
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,640
You know, there's no such thing. It's all fitness.

636
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,540
How do I be healthy? I say healthy for what?

637
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,500
What are you going to do?

638
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,140
What are you going to do?

639
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,820
You sit in the office all day, eight hours a day and then whatever.

640
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,880
Well, you're going to go. You're going to go climb.

641
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,900
You're going to go skydiving.

642
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,080
Are you going to jump out of?

643
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,920
Are you going to go to Mount Everest next week?

644
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,340
What kind of health for what level of fitness are you looking for?

645
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,540
I got you. See, that's why fitness is a better word. Right.

646
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,400
Because what it is, you're free to do what it is.

647
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,120
You're fit to do is what you're saying.

648
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,260
So, look, if you need to be fit to run a marathon, that's one thing.

649
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,260
If you need to be fit so that, you know, your legs stop aching,

650
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,280
that's another thing.

651
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,320
So, you know, therefore, what fitness are you looking for?

652
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,060
It's adjustable based on what your needs are, what you're going to do with it.

653
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,580
Right. Right.

654
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,120
The culture says, oh, be healthy, look healthy.

655
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,780
This is healthy.

656
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,040
What are you talking about? You're so far off the mark.

657
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,920
Right. But the whole discussion.

658
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,800
And by the way, I'm the only one that I've been looking at this.

659
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,020
The only one that I've seen available ever say this, by the way, this is a

660
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,740
this could be a study and a movement on its own, meaning a movement

661
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,640
to get out there to communicate to many people.

662
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,580
Start thinking on your own.

663
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Did you consider this?

664
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,360
Yeah. Stop. Right.

665
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,500
Stop with the one size fits all healthy crap.

666
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,940
Let's get to what is. Yeah.

667
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,860
Or even if they offer you 10 sizes, it's not no good or 100 sizes

668
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,960
because there's a million different things you could be doing

669
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,700
that you need different fitnesses for.

670
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,180
There you go. So, yeah.

671
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,840
So, OK, so then we we get down to what the human body is now.

672
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,780
I think I've mentioned before about 99 percent of what the medical industry

673
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,040
does is unnecessary.

674
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,580
It's job security, right?

675
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,720
They got really ridiculous with the pharmaceutical companies,

676
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,400
which is the same thing, you know, like the

677
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,840
there was no pet food until the 60s.

678
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,560
And they had one can of pet food.

679
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,480
It was for dogs, cats, whatever carnivore.

680
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,440
And then they specialized it, right, because they started

681
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,240
pushing the vets and the vets were trained by the food and chemical companies.

682
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,060
Right. Right.

683
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,980
Anyway, so, again, by the way, if you go to a vet,

684
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,660
why don't they check the blood pressure of your dog or your cat or your bird ever?

685
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,080
You have no sign. They never do that pressure.

686
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,560
If it's so important to.

687
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,540
Oh, but it's not. I've had one say to me, oh, but it's not the same grief.

688
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,060
Oh, but they're mammals.

689
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,980
Yeah, they're almost like, yeah, they experiment on pigs.

690
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,900
You can actually put a pig liver in a human.

691
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,800
It's almost identical.

692
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,900
You know, we share more closer genes with pigs

693
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,740
and internal organs than we do with chimpanzees any day.

694
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,380
Oh, please. I went through six articles this week about pig,

695
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,900
pig organ transplants into people, you know.

696
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,820
Yeah. Well, if you anyway, you know, pigs eat their own kind.

697
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,580
So anyway. Well, that too.

698
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,140
Yeah. So here's the thing.

699
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,100
Why? It's very easy to uncover the what what's being pulled on humanity

700
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:39,120
are juvenile level pranks, juvenile level pranks with high level authority position.

701
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,620
I had a recent conversation with someone about the medical.

702
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,000
I said, just go look at the medical stuff.

703
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,120
But it doesn't work that way.

704
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,440
It says, well, you don't need to look at the medical.

705
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,840
So I say, man, look at the stuff that's accumulated through the years

706
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,020
that's considered the base knowledge of the medical industry

707
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,280
and what doctors are supposedly trained in.

708
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Well, it doesn't matter.

709
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,200
It doesn't matter what they're trained in.

710
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
Just do what they tell you.

711
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,360
I was like, well, it was perfect.

712
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,140
You're not real.

713
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,860
You know, you're obviously one of the filler.

714
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,080
You know, you're one of the you know, it's like if you go talk to an extra

715
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,480
on a movie set, ask them, you know, what are the what's in the script?

716
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,820
You're like, I didn't get a script. I'm just standing here.

717
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,960
You know, I got no purpose.

718
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,280
I got I'm getting to show up in here.

719
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,520
Yeah. All I got to do is show up.

720
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,060
And that's this guy's whole life.

721
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,040
Right. Is to just show up here.

722
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,100
You know, so that's on that side. I'm with the elite.

723
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,720
Like, what do we need these people for?

724
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,360
You know, it's like you don't.

725
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,300
But you do need them now because now the scene requires seven billion

726
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,540
or whatever they're telling you.

727
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,640
But in the future, you won't.

728
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,420
And they're they make they make no difference if they're here.

729
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes, I agree.

730
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,860
They're actually in many cases, they can be detrimental.

731
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,360
But just leave them alone.

732
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,560
They got no value. Right.

733
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,280
And this is kind of because we're taught the opposite. Right.

734
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,320
Right. Yeah. So it's always the opposite.

735
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,880
So, again, so I've covered several things there.

736
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,660
And the other thing I wanted to cover, which is really, really difficult.

737
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,420
I mean, it's almost impossible.

738
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,960
But there is a mix where the spirit commands just like a composer.

739
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,260
Imagine what?

740
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,460
What do you call the guys in front of an orchestra?

741
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,760
Not the composer, director, conductor, conductor.

742
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,060
Yeah, right. You have to play conductor.

743
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,739
But the thing is, usually when you say conductor, it sounds complicated,

744
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,940
but it's more like a train. You got stop and go.

745
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,540
Yeah. Right. OK.

746
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,400
Think of it like that.

747
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,760
So you have to keep in mind the body has its own consciousness,

748
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,580
its will to want to stay alive.

749
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,440
You have your own way of thinking, whatever you find.

750
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,420
And then, which is typically what most people think is their voices,

751
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,679
not their voice. And then there's the silent part.

752
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,580
If the silent part isn't getting through to you and you start thinking

753
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,820
and you're focusing on the voice that you're always hearing,

754
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,480
which is not you anyway, it's kind of like someone just tuned in.

755
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,120
I never heard the rest of this. I think this is crazy talk.

756
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:57,520
But anyway, the part of you that needs to develop and know more. Right.

757
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,480
Sometimes the part of you that needs to develop your consciousness,

758
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,220
that's silent, that makes it's really the you part of your spirit.

759
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,120
If you ignore it long enough,

760
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,280
it will project its desires around the people around you.

761
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,060
It could be total strangers.

762
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,420
And sometimes they will start saying things

763
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,580
to communicate what your spirit wants you

764
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,820
to hear that you're ignoring.

765
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,660
See, I put a stop to that a few years ago because that that was what I couldn't

766
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,740
understand for a little while.

767
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,200
The oddity of strangers walking up to me saying things that were relevant to me

768
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,400
for no reason, I thought.

769
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which I don't know.

770
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,840
Look, I advise anybody here in what you're saying right now to try and relate

771
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,200
this to something they've seen already.

772
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,100
OK, because it's a very difficult thing.

773
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,480
In other words, if you ignore yourself enough, it will not jump out of your body.

774
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,440
It will project itself in the field around you amongst other things immediate.

775
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,000
And someone might say who doesn't even know you or anything, say something.

776
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,080
But it's really your own spirit going over to their side

777
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,880
and reflecting back to you. Hey, dummy, you're ignoring me.

778
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,980
So this other person is going to say what you need to hear.

779
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,660
Right. So in other words, that's why.

780
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,560
OK, and again, what is this is kind of advanced, but I'm going to say it anyway.

781
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,420
What that means, then you should always surround yourself

782
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,640
with people that you find pleasure, pleasant and can communicate well with.

783
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,100
Right. So you can hear that. You can hear that.

784
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,300
So how many times? OK, here's a more mild way to say this.

785
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,000
How many times have you seen a situation in film or theater or wherever

786
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,320
where people say, I need to have a serious personal talk with you?

787
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,100
Come in the room with me. Right. Yeah.

788
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,900
And they sit down and they give the person not the right act,

789
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,880
but they just say things about what their behavior, their thinking or whatever.

790
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,020
Right. And one of the persons that go, I didn't know that. Thank you.

791
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,440
I'll take that in consideration. Right. Or whatever. Right.

792
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,160
Right. Imagine that scene, but not being deliberate,

793
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,320
but happening in the ether with your surroundings or with other people.

794
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,640
They will actually your consciousness will influence their consciousness

795
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
to say something to you.

796
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,620
And very often it could be in other influences.

797
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,520
But sometimes that person will say something so poignant.

798
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,340
You're like, oh, my gosh, that makes so much sense.

799
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,160
And if you ask them to repeat that, they're like, repeat what?

800
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,580
What did I say? I don't remember that. Right.

801
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,200
And a lot of people go, oh, well, that's like the angels coming at.

802
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,540
No, that's you. It's you sometimes.

803
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,340
Well, no. Yeah. If you could discern it, you could see the difference.

804
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,160
Sometimes it's an external influence that could do that also

805
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,820
because they know how this works.

806
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,480
See, how do you know the difference, though?

807
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,160
Well, that's the that's the thing that might be part of the unknowable category

808
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,860
for us here. Right. OK.

809
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,080
You know, it wouldn't be if we knew every if we knew exactly what was going to

810
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,200
happen, so that what time and what day we're going to die.

811
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,760
How interesting would that be?

812
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,400
Not too interesting. Right.

813
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,480
Well, I would try and load up everything in between now and then

814
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,060
in different ways, wouldn't I?

815
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, that's why you have that party once a year

816
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,620
that you remember for the rest of the year anyway.

817
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,860
You see. So, yeah. So again,

818
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,860
the basic thing that I would suggest to anyone is quality of life issue.

819
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,340
What can you put up with? Right.

820
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,620
And we could put up with a lot.

821
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,040
Medical industry doesn't even exist.

822
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,160
OK, like I just showed you, it's about hygiene and painkillers

823
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,760
because you could go into shock.

824
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,460
Look, I have to stop myself from going into mild shock.

825
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,560
There's categories of it.

826
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,320
Right. When I nearly chopped my thumb off

827
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,400
with an ax about six months ago, which, by the way, there is no scar,

828
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,500
nothing visible.

829
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,760
If I had gone to the medics, they would have a big scar around the finger.

830
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,620
You know, 15, 20, 30 stitches.

831
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,020
They were trying to stitch it. OK, we got to get a guy in here.

832
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,660
Yeah. And it wouldn't have healed completely in five days or six days.

833
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,300
It would have been still, you know, so you would probably are completely useless.

834
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,620
But yeah, if you think, look, it's gotten to the point now where

835
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,220
many people had their loved ones, their family members

836
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,120
killed by the very doctors knowingly.

837
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,280
And they actually when they got the message that they're, you know,

838
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,240
with the covid thing, yeah, they put them on respirators,

839
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,140
didn't give them any food, any water for a week.

840
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,480
And they finally sedated them to the point where their hearts up.

841
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,120
And they shot him up with a vaccine, too,

842
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,640
because they get an extra 30 grand for that. Right. Sure.

843
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,260
So there's a lot of people.

844
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,000
I see the majority of these idiots who have one of their family members,

845
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,740
loved husband, my children, whatever, die or actually killed. Right.

846
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,160
By these doctors that are there's Scott free still. Right. Right.

847
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,220
And they're probably never going to.

848
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,400
They will be from another source.

849
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,360
So it's dealt with.

850
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,400
But well, eventually everything gets dealt with.

851
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,640
But exactly. But right now they won't.

852
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,040
But these people who had their family killed by these administrators

853
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,500
and doctors actually go and thank them for everything they did to help.

854
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,240
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

855
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,180
How that's such a bet. You know what I mean?

856
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,840
Yeah, it's crazy.

857
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,700
You know how many times you heard, oh, thank you.

858
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,880
She did. You know, your mom died or whatever.

859
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,540
Oh, thank you for doctors.

860
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,540
And we're going to set up a go fund me for your research and all that.

861
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,280
You know, they're laughing their asses off.

862
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,040
90 percent of the doctors know that they what they're doing and who they kill

863
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
and who they know. They're not that stupid.

864
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,000
They're stupid in terms of their profession.

865
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,880
But, you know, again, I had it.

866
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,140
Here's a conversation I had.

867
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,040
OK, so this is your Christian, right?

868
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,400
She goes, yeah, are you from one to ten?

869
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,640
What would you say? She's nine and a half.

870
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,660
So how much of the Bible do you know? Probably zero.

871
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,020
Right. Because, yeah, I don't know.

872
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,120
OK, so when you go to a doctor, if he says from one to ten, he's a nine point

873
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,740
five doctor, how much of the medical stuff, the information does,

874
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,740
you know, probably zero, maybe one or two.

875
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,860
But he's pulling it off as being a doctor.

876
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,440
You see what I mean? Right.

877
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,840
You see, it's the same thing.

878
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,020
How can you go say you believe in this and know nothing about it?

879
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,960
And you see, he's just playing a doctor.

880
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,380
There's no reason to be hard on them, because, look,

881
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,240
if you really want to be harsh on someone, they did a whole thing where,

882
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,940
you know, the car mechanics, right, they was at the television.

883
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,340
They marked the filter that they're supposed to change the oil in the brakes

884
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
and they get the car back.

885
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,960
They pay the bill and they didn't do anything.

886
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,880
And they actually had the thing marked, you know, right.

887
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,060
You've seen that, you know, they're busting them and all that.

888
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,280
So it's the doctors, it's the car mechanics, it's the accountants,

889
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,880
IRS agents, the police.

890
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,220
Do you want to go? I mean, is it fair to to just pick on the doctors?

891
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,440
No, it's the whole society's fucked.

892
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,180
No, exactly. You know, it would be like me

893
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,380
thinking that that that jackass in a blue uniform

894
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,300
that shot my dog when I was a kid, you know.

895
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,620
Oh, thanks so much.

896
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,240
You know, now, yeah, they say we shot him to protect himself.

897
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,840
It's just ridiculous. So you're in a ridiculous place.

898
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,040
It's a it's a wonderful place.

899
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,100
You know, it's it's like a terrarium that's set up with care.

900
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,840
In other words, it's set up in a way that everything stays pretty.

901
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,040
Like, give me an example.

902
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,640
You can have a screwed up ecology.

903
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,040
And if you leave it alone, if the humans went away for 30, 40 years

904
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,420
and come back, it will be overgrown and natural again. Right.

905
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,280
That's what I mean by it's well, well cared for.

906
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,160
The system itself cares for itself.

907
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,120
You know, the Earth planet.

908
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,720
So it could be very beautiful.

909
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,420
You know, if all the humans didn't left and came back,

910
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,780
let's say 500 years from now, the planet would be like this paradise, right?

911
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,540
Wild paradise with different temperate zones and all that.

912
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,200
You can see that.

913
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,080
Well, what was it?

914
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,660
George Carlin said the only thing we contributed here is plastic.

915
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,520
Right. Outside of that doesn't matter.

916
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,480
The rest of the Earth will reclaim it anyway.

917
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah, the Earth can reclaim.

918
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,760
So that's what I mean by it being a wonderful system.

919
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,480
There you go.
