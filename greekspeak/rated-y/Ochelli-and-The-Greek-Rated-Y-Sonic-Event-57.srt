00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,079
Sonic Event 57 rated Y. Anyway, interesting stuff in the chat. We'll address it real quick

2
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:19,400
at the top. But first, how you doing, Greg? I am doing all right. You know, we're in the

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,060
about the middle of the week for the first week of the eighth month. So which which actually

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,440
starting to line up. I think we talked, you know, oct right

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,080
means a octopus. Right? I mean, whatever octagon octagon. Yeah,

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,280
of course. Yeah.

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,680
Dr. octopus. Yeah, octopus octagon. So, hey, yeah, couple

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,620
things in the chat. Kudos to the guy working on the magnetic

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,460
device. My advice is when you're working with that stuff in your

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,620
beginner, don't let your work go down the drain, so to speak, make

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,960
sure you think it through and have clamps and, and things to

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,520
hold things together. So if they don't seem like they're going to

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,900
hold together, they do. So you don't waste your time. Or you

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,140
could privately message me on common sense radio one at gmail

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,640
dot com. It's number one, I think you have. The thing I want

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,740
to get into is I was mentioning. Well, for one thing,

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,520
there was a couple of things in the chat. Let me just dispense

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,760
with that thing, too. Yeah, if you don't mind.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,740
Well, please do. Yeah, on the record. Yeah, just let's put it

20
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,000
on the record. You know, there was a bunch of stuff about

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,920
timekeeping. So I'm glad you addressed that right away. I see

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,520
people working on it. There's an app an interesting app. I don't

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,760
know what your thoughts were on that. But anything that'll help

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,580
you reckon? No, I did not see the app. Okay, well, they showed a

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,540
picture of an app where it lets you see when the you know, with

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,540
the the moon when it when it first is emerging over the

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,200
horizon, this and that gives you an idea. I mean, look, oh, yeah,

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,460
there's plenty of I thought you said a lawful timekeeping app.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,100
And I'm like, Oh, finally, thank you. No, no, I didn't see a

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,680
lawful time. Oh, no, no, no. Yeah. Because there's tons of

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,120
apps. But go ahead. Well, no, it's just look, these can be

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,220
tools to get you to a helpful conclusion. Let's just say it's

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,080
cloudy. Well, you got to know what to do it again. It's like,

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,000
you know, if you're five years old. By the way, this is true. I

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,800
had a relative who was a naval engineer, naval architect.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
What's that they design ships, not boats, you know, the

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,360
difference in a boat and a ship, right? Oh, well, you could put a

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
boat on a ship, or you can't put a ship on a boat.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,940
Yeah, absolutely. True. But they design a lot more than that. I

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,680
mean, they design the mechanisms, the winches, the

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,620
things that actually, you know, move boats up and down.

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,280
Yeah, they're consulted for harbors and things like that.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,620
So also, so so here's the interesting part. I would love

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,960
it five years. It was like 1969 1970. And going through books

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,260
and looking at all these equations and technical

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,980
drawings. I was fascinated. Did I learn anything? Did I know

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,480
what to do with that? No. You see what I mean? You can have all

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,940
the apps in the world. But if you don't know when to place the

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,780
marker, you know, when does the day start? Right? And why? It

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,000
doesn't matter. By the way, all that stuff has been staring me

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,020
in the face, you know, when I was really young, and I remember

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,320
depositing a check in the, in the bank in the 70s. And it was

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,340
counted as the next day because it was our one o'clock. Oh,

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,400
yeah, that kind of stuff stuck in my head. It was like, why are

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,980
you gonna remember that? Remember that? Because it's

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,240
bizarre. It's like everybody sticks to this calendar, except

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,580
at the bank, because I'm there at two in the afternoon. It's the

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,720
next day. Why? Yeah, I know. It's weird. Um, look, there was

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,860
all that stuff going on. Yes. And I remember as a kid, that

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,540
there were plenty of again, a lot of let's just go ethnic for a

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,200
moment, a lot of Italian and Irish guys around big surprise

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,420
in New Jersey, right. And a lot of them, you know, they could

63
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,480
build a house or almost anything with what they carried

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,820
around on what they used to call a tool belt. That's all they

65
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,060
really needed. As far as tools went hand tools, even they could

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,120
build entire structures. No problem. Nowadays, geez, these

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,300
guys show up with truckloads of crap. I mean, you know what I

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,980
mean? Oh, yeah. Well, it's pretty fabricated. And there's

69
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,920
not much to it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, here's the thing. Okay,

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,420
let's just jump to it. Book of Revelation. Someone asked, he's

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,300
a very good participant in Greek speak for a long time.

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,160
Right? He's been around since the beginning of you and me

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,000
talking. Absolutely. Yeah, he's a veteran. Yeah, you're right.

74
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,840
So yes, the answer is, get into the book of Revelation. Not now,

75
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,540
not next week, maybe in a few months. I'm rehashing

76
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,620
everything, especially thanks to who sent me the Aramaic version

77
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,720
of the New Testament in hardcover. Very gracious. A

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,380
present that was sent to me a while back. I'm looking into

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,880
that as well. Again, does the Vatican sort of approve the

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,040
Bible? And the answer is yes. So you got to be wary, right? So it

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,480
has to be looked at from a way that they don't want you to see

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,280
it. And I've been doing that more and more. And we'll get

83
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,120
into it more and more as the timelines that I've brought up

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,500
are approaching. Well, and it is accurate to say many, many

85
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,300
things are hidden in plain sight. And we'll leave it at that for

86
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,000
now until and I'm anxiously awaiting you getting back into

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,820
that. Because, you know, that that has been a fascination of

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,120
mine pretty much since I learned to read the book of

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,160
Revelations. And it was much more popular among people to kind

90
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,220
of examine it on their own. But really, again, it was, you know,

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,220
monkeys working with machine guns. Well, it's banned. It's

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,660
indirectly banned by the Eastern Orthodox Church and other

93
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,800
things like that. And you cannot approach anything in the Bible

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,900
with religious, you know, approach, right? In other words,

95
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,880
if your faith depends on what you understand in the Bible,

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,620
you're going to be, you know, it's going to be very difficult.

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,900
In other words, you won't have much faith until you figure it

98
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,320
out, right? You get it. So most people's faith is based on

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,300
feeling and things like that, which we I'd like to get more

100
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,600
into that in the future. But before we do, I wanted to say,

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,660
hey, I said, Chuck, let's I want to get into how to cook a five

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,700
star meal really simply, right?

103
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,920
And I love this practical knowledge is the best after all

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,360
look, we can discuss the the different things that are not

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,160
quite practical in the moment. But I mean, a five star meal is

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,620
useful at any time.

107
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,460
Yeah, it'll be an example. It'll be a quick run through. And, and

108
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,620
it's interesting. Okay, what it is, it's basically meat and

109
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,300
potatoes, right? I love it, right? I love it. Okay, so

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,760
really, what you do is you'd say, I'm going to give the you'll

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,420
get the shopping list, as I say, which makes basically a slab is

112
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,080
slab of meat, beef with potato salad. Okay. Now let's get into

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,180
you want to get into this, the meat first or the potato salad

114
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,880
first, which one?

115
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,640
Well, I like the meat first, because that's often, you know,

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,760
problematic. I mean, which kind of cut, you know, blah, blah,

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,760
everything. What would you have?

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,040
The wife says she likes the meat first, too. Yeah. So let's do

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,280
this.

120
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,460
Then why is she with you?

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,520
That's right.

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,060
I couldn't resist.

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,460
Alright, so this is what we do is you get a good slab of meat.

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,200
This particular is a fairly lean cut of sirloin. It's about an

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,820
inch and a half thick, a little bit more than several of them.

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,880
But let's say two inches would be good. Right? But on bump,

127
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,780
right? So, because that's definitely what you said.

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,380
All right, I'm done. Sorry. Yeah, right. But you got to

129
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,900
multiply. So here's the thing, your choice of meat, there might

130
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,660
vary. But I would suggest that it's a rare thing to no pun

131
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,500
intended with the meat to pursue. To want to get a piece

132
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,080
of meat. For some people that is of the highest quality. Most

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,980
people say I want a steak, they'll go to a steak house or

134
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,880
they'll go buy a piece of steak, and they don't think about the

135
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,020
quality too much. Right. So when I say I cooked a piece of meat,

136
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,100
it's a it's a it's almost like literally like you went on a

137
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,780
hunt. Like, you know, the amount of energy right back in the days,

138
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,760
right? Because, you know, so in other words, it's a it's a good

139
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,360
quality piece, right? What makes it a good quality piece? Well,

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,120
you figure that out, right? Okay, so. Alright, so what we did

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,680
here is I sectioned off enough for two people about a little

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,200
bit over a pound and a half, and started drying the meat. So

143
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,300
it's out of the fridge, everything I'm saying is out of

144
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,440
the fridge. I when I got the meat, it was cold. And that was

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,260
the last time it saw the cold was when I purchased it, it never

146
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,820
went into the fridge after that, from all this time that I'm

147
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,960
going to mention what's going on. You want to dry the meat.

148
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,400
Now, if you're doing poultry, fish, any kind of meat, that

149
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,600
you're going to subject to a flame, a pan, a broil, you get

150
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,100
the idea, not a stew, not a soup, but something that's

151
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,000
going to be cooked on, you know, in a pan with some fat or oil,

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,780
you know, butter or whatever, or in the on the grill, or a

153
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,240
griddle or flame, okay, in other words, you're going to

154
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,940
subject that piece of meat to above the boiling, the boiling

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,340
point of water. If you're going to cook a piece of meat above

156
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,060
the boiling point of water, which is actually what it is, when you

157
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,100
when you're going to fry something in a pan, that pan, if

158
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,540
you hit it with a thermometer, one of those laser thermometer

159
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,040
deals, it's going to be like 350 375 minimum before you start

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
anything, right? Yeah, before really. Okay. So so why am I

161
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
stressing this? What is he? What's his point? You want the

162
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,800
meats, whether it's fish, fowl, or beef or whatever, anything to

163
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,760
be as dry as possible. Why? Because when the the higher than

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,140
boiling point temperature hits the flesh, you want it to

165
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,000
develop a sear, you want it to develop a caramelization, you

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,360
want it to develop a browning, right? Okay, if it hits the

167
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,760
moisture, it will never it will not start to do that until all

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,020
the water is boiled off. Right, right. Because in order to get

169
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,480
that that coating that browning, you need to be above 350. If

170
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,840
there's moisture on it, guess what, it will not go above the

171
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,080
boiling point of water till that water is gone. So now what

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,340
you're doing is you're actually poaching and boiling the meats,

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,600
whatever it is, fish, fowl, beef. Okay, so how do you dry

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,400
the meat? Well, initially, I would wrap it in paper towels,

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,620
you know, you don't want to spend $20 a month on paper

176
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,700
towels. Remember the commercial? Oh, yeah. Wow,

177
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,120
whatever. Okay. So you don't want to do that. So what I do is

178
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,340
sometimes I do that I buy a cheap cheap restaurant napkins

179
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,400
is a big box room for 40 bucks. They last like 10 years, you

180
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,860
know, or you dry it out, literally, you have a rack and

181
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,620
you put the meat or whatever after you've batted it down. You

182
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,080
know, like the brown paper bags you get from shopping, right?

183
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,540
Oh, that's a, you know, not not the small bags that you put

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,700
something but the you know, the ones with the handles. Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,380
Hard to get nowadays. But yeah, you can get them in from you

186
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,740
can get them. Yeah. And when you open them up, they have a nice

187
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,300
flat bottom, right? You have to stand up on their own, right?

188
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,680
That's right. Pour some salt on that and put a piece of paper

189
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,540
over the salt. And then a small rack like you know, the toaster

190
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,300
oven racks, right? Something like that. If you don't have a

191
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,820
toaster oven rack, you can use bamboo skewers, some wood

192
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,080
chopsticks, whatever, right. And then you have the the the

193
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,740
meat, fish, fowl, whatever over that bed of salt, not touching

194
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,000
it. And then you just fold the top of the bag staple it put a

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,800
clothespin or something. And you can leave it in there overnight

196
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,980
eight hours at all, you know, whatever. And that will allow

197
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,880
for the drying of the meat. So there you go. So we drive the

198
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,080
meat overnight. Now, should that be stored in the fridge or out?

199
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,980
No, not necessarily. No. Remember, we're talking about

200
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,440
good quality meat. Let me give you an example. I remember once

201
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,160
I was grilling some fowl and there was some dogs person that

202
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,200
came over. This is a long time ago. I gave him I broke off some

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,620
chicken wings and gave the dogs that we had here some chicken

204
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,640
reasons. No, no, give the dog raw chicken. It might have

205
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,300
salmonella. I'm like, Are you kidding? You think like cooking

206
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,740
is going to get rid of that? I don't want to buy if I know the

207
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,280
chicken or any animal is diseased. You're not you. I

208
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,900
don't eat it, whether it's cooked raw or anything. Right?

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,960
You see what I mean? This is a you have to cook it for food

210
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,620
borne illness. So okay, so that's the thing about the

211
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,980
fridge. No, no fridging here. Because, you know, if you're

212
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,480
going to do something where you want to be extra safe, the fridge

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,300
is fine. Right. But it's more than fine. I'll tell you why,

214
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,020
even though I'm not a proponent for it, because it doesn't allow

215
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,200
the muscle, the flesh to relax, right. And the fat to slightly

216
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,180
melt and tenderize. The fridge is fine for drying, because guess

217
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,260
what fridges do? They dry things out. Right? Yeah, so that's

218
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,660
fine. But I'm not a proponent for it. Because there's a

219
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,280
tenderization. What I also did was I put some baking soda and

220
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,320
water with some spices and I dunk the steak in there. Right? The

221
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,020
slab of meat for 10 minutes, and then I rinse it off. That gets

222
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,700
you know, I think I talked about why you should never have raw

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,720
hamburger, right? Because raw or rare, rare typically, because

224
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,140
the E. coli develops on the outside of the flesh. So when

225
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,800
the animal dies, it actually starts to develop very quickly

226
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,660
depending on where you live and other conditions, right? And

227
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,680
then when you grind it all up, it's all it goes inside, right?

228
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,880
Where if you have it on the outside of a steak or something,

229
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
it burns off on the outside, right? If you have E. coli

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,800
parasite, okay, which is an emergent, but also it could be

231
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,700
transferred. So I just wanted to mention that. Yes. Alright, so

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,800
at this point, we've got the meat dried out. And what I do

233
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
now is I set up an oven. This happens to be a small electric

234
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,580
oven like the large size toaster oven. I set it at 145

235
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,320
155 degrees, it bounces around between there. It's like, wow,

236
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,020
what's outside a warmer. And the meat goes in there in a small

237
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,180
pan. And for one hour at 150 degrees, you're like, Oh, what's

238
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,740
he doing? Very, very low temperature for cooking. But

239
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,260
high temp higher than the room temperature. Right? So it's

240
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,220
basically warming the steak. Now this is just under two

241
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,140
inches. So an hour was enough to get it to about a little bit

242
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,580
over 110 inside. Yeah, it's only double it's only double the

243
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,700
room temperature really probably so it's warming the meat. So

244
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,640
basically you got a warm slab of meat now for an hour. What I've

245
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,360
prepared outside is a mesquite fire. And I take the slab of

246
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,720
meat and throw it on the grill, close the top very little

247
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,880
oxygen for two minutes per side. Then it comes off of the grill.

248
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,440
In other words, it gets grill marks browning char the fat and

249
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,900
all that right gets charred goes back into the the the small

250
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,380
oven for 145 155 degrees for about a half hour. Then you turn

251
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,240
it off and you prop it up on an angle somehow with skewers,

252
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,220
forks, whatever, and let all the juices drain out. It's called

253
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,300
a Jew, Jew, right? Okay. Right until the meat comes down to

254
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,680
just above room temperature, like what's a high fever

255
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,000
temperature like 105 or so. Okay, it's also rested. Okay,

256
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,820
so that's how you prepare the steak this way. Now this has

257
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,800
nothing to do with you know, people go out and they grill

258
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,940
they take the meat, they put it directly on the thing. Is it

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,480
done yet? How do you want it rare or whatever? So you know,

260
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,040
so rare before a few minutes on each side, you know, and then

261
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,440
from then on, you know, right? No, we're not. This is nothing

262
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,000
like that. We're not on cooking yet. We're still on prep here.

263
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,140
Yeah, no, this is the cooking that was done. The meat is done

264
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,480
now. Done. Oh, yeah. Okay, it is done. Yeah, it's very okay.

265
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,020
Years ago, there was a fad of poaching meat when you had a

266
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,580
high quality piece of meat. You put it in a Ziploc bag, and you

267
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,140
seal it and you drop that Ziploc bag in boiling water, right? You

268
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,860
know, holding it up, you know, like they even have rice things

269
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,660
like prefabricated food is like that, you know, there was a

270
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,120
bunch of the old buck Uncle Ben's rice, you know, you put

271
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,400
the pouch in the water. Remember? Yeah, there was a

272
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
bunch of different foods you could put in a pouch in the

273
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,980
water, and then you pop open the pouch done. Yeah, I'm

274
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,320
Maurice are like that they have the heating element, you know,

275
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,120
the meal, right? Military has these little heat packs, too.

276
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,020
That's right. Okay, so what they did was they did that. And they

277
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,400
did that for about 10 minutes, 15 minutes of the meat came up

278
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,580
to temperature, then they would grill it in a very hot pan with

279
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,080
butter or flame again, just to finish it on the outside,

280
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,280
right? Sure. So it's it's very antithesis to, you know, is it

281
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,740
cooked through as a heated through? Because here we're

282
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,780
heating, you know, they say, basically, you know, when you

283
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,220
look at the packages, it's got to be 135 degrees 128, right? So

284
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,660
now you're bringing it up to that temperature before you do

285
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,100
the cooking. And then the cooking is just for show and for

286
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,920
flavor. How much char do you want? How much brown do you want?

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
Right? By the way, I'm going to photograph all this and put it

288
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,580
on the chitango. Okay, what the finished meal looks like. So we

289
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,000
end up with a very rare steak, but it's not bloody rare. It's

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,760
not black and blue, where the meat's kind of raw. And there's

291
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,820
no juices that are dripping because it's completely rested.

292
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,700
You know what it's like? Back in the days, remember, you go to

293
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,700
an old school deli and they have a heat lamp with a turkey and a

294
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,440
big slab of roast beef. And if you order, you know, they slice

295
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,340
it right off right there.

296
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,400
Guy comes over with a big knife and cuts off your piece right in

297
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,040
front of you. Yes.

298
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, yeah. Right. It sounded like he cuts off your piece

299
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,660
right in front of you. But anyway, yeah, yeah, exactly.

300
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,640
Yeah. Okay. So that's exactly what it's like. It's a very

301
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,540
dry, very tender. So what happens when the meat gets to

302
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,480
relax at room temperature, there's a micro amount of fat

303
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,560
that tends to melt off and get between the other muscle fibers.

304
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,400
By the way, when I say most, you know, if you go to a hardcore

305
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,460
Chinese restaurant, that's really for Chinese people with

306
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,020
all Chinese menus, and they have some menus with English

307
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,260
translation. When you look at beef, it says muscle, it doesn't

308
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,359
say beef, it'll say cow muscle. And if you're right, because

309
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,720
that's what it is. It's not organs. It's not liver. It's not

310
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,580
kidney. It's not tongue. It's not brains. It's not testicles,

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,420
right? It's muscle.

312
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,220
It is muscle and people can eat those other parts if they want,

313
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,280
but when you're eating steak or beef, you're eating the muscle,

314
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,600
muscle, exactly. And when you tell most people, it's muscle,

315
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,600
they're like, what do you mean? It's steak, it's hammer, it's

316
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,120
it's you're eating muscle. By the way, it's toxic to many

317
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,240
animals, you know, in the in the wild, the large predators, they

318
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,280
eat all the organ meat first, right? You're aware of that.

319
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,680
Yeah, a lot of the animals are getting sick in zoos, because

320
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,880
they just fed them leftover, you know, supermarket steaks, they

321
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,460
need liver, they need kidney, they need brains, they need

322
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,160
right? The tigers and lions. And that's why a lot of those

323
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,960
guys have tried keeping those big cats in the in the 70s and

324
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,660
80s. They kept having to run them into places to save their

325
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,160
lives because they were throwing them steaks and they were not

326
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
not well, it creates toxicity for them if they just eat

327
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,380
muscle. Yeah. All right. So that's basically the steak and

328
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,380
what basically it's finished, you know, once the final warming

329
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,280
and resting is done, what you'll end up with is with an

330
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,900
incredible beef flavor, because you know how heat and fire adds,

331
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,460
you know, you know, caramelization, browning, golden

332
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,380
brown adds flavor, but also takes away flavor, right? It

333
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,360
burns away very subtle things, right? Like, you know, like

334
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,940
bread, if you toast bread perfectly, it's delicious. But

335
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,420
if you overtoast it, you just taste the carbon, you don't

336
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,360
taste anything. Oh, yeah, you get that nasty bitterness on the

337
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,260
outside. Yeah. And that's what that's how most people when

338
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,560
they're grilling or subjecting things to fire, you know, so so

339
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,120
what this does is it allows you to get the full spectrum beef

340
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,320
flavor, with the full spectrum cook, appearance and taste both

341
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,500
together. Because remember, it only hit the fire for less than

342
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,880
two minutes on each side. And the rest of it was at 150 degrees

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,760
100, you know, you see, so it allows this incredible flavor of

344
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,580
beef to come through almost like imagine a really good beef stew

345
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,740
with a really good steak and a really good hamburger, all put

346
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,700
together. It's really very different, right? And the meat

347
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,900
is exceptionally tender, because you've let it rest and dry

348
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,000
before you've done all this. I personally let them go for about

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,740
24 hours, you know, outside of the fridge, but it's covered,

350
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,680
you know, you know, you've got to be smart. And as you

351
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,060
described it, closing up that bag. I mean, it is covered.

352
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,140
It's not gonna right. I mean, if you have dogs and cats, you

353
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,460
know, yeah, I have a place outside usually or inside, you

354
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,700
want some air movement also, because it could get humid in

355
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,660
there and stuffy, right? So that basically, you do the same for

356
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,780
fish, you do the same for poultry, for example, poultry, I

357
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,320
hang the bird outside for a few hours, right? And you always have

358
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,540
to Brian poultry, which is a saltwater Brian, you know, based

359
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,960
on weight, a turkey can go six, eight hours, a chicken an hour

360
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,780
and a half, two hours is fine. If you Brian it over Brian, it

361
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,800
tastes like fake food. They don't it tastes like if you're

362
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,660
Brian, any foul, it tastes just like the deli meat you get.

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,240
Right? Like, yeah, it tastes like deli meat, you know, like

364
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,760
turkey slices, or whatever, it ends up taking on that flavor.

365
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,060
And it's like, why bother? It's vaguely like the meat that

366
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,080
you're looking to taste. And it's more like the process than

367
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,880
it tastes like a processed food, right? Very much so. So you got

368
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,020
to be careful, but always hang the bird and dry. And I've had

369
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,000
several people say, Look, I, I don't dry the meat and all that

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,180
because I like it moist. I'm like, Oh, my gosh, where do you

371
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,580
start? Right? You know, unless you're going to make a super

372
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,760
stew, even then, if you're going to make even a super stew, the

373
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,020
meat will be more tender if you add it to the broth or whatever

374
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,460
you're doing. Prior that in a dry state again, because it will

375
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,100
not right rely on the water in in it to change temperature. So

376
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
that's pretty much the steak. Now you let it rest and you

377
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,320
slice it really thin. And one thing I'll get into solo sonics

378
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,560
other things hopefully one day soon, is how to set up your

379
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,480
kitchen will probably be a multiple part series. And I

380
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,100
won't talk about how to cook or make anything, it'll be just

381
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,600
basic kitchen setup and what to look for. And one of the things

382
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,880
that I'm going to be stressing is how to go one of the reasons

383
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,860
I haven't done it yet, because I haven't found any information

384
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,540
out there. So I'm gonna have to somehow say on my own how to

385
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,060
maintain your cutlery, your knives, right? Because if you

386
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,580
don't have a sharp knife, you ain't you're not good. It's you

387
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,080
cannot put one of the hallmarks. If you go to a

388
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,840
really high end restaurant, right? When there's time for the

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,700
chef to go home, he wraps up his knives and puts them in a bag

390
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,120
and leaves with his knives. And when he shows up to work the

391
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,800
next day, guess what he's got? He's brought his knives. Right?

392
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,760
Why? Because it's right. You see what I mean?

393
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,020
Those are his tools. I mean, and that's his Yeah, of course.

394
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,620
And it's not just I mean, chef knives on the average are

395
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,520
several hundred dollars each utility, utilitarian ones, if

396
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,260
you want to get fancy, they get into the 1000s. But here's the

397
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,560
thing. It's what you've invested to get the edge as

398
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,940
sharp and just right for your use in the sharp as possible.

399
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,460
The last thing you want is someone who has a different

400
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,860
attitude with knives to use it to cut something or a technique

401
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,160
to cut and then you have to start honing and creating a new

402
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,360
edge, right? I've actually invented a tool to put a the

403
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,200
edge that I like, which is a very shallow edge on a knife,

404
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,700
you have to have good steel. So

405
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,900
side issue, I actually wanted to get into cutlery. And you know,

406
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,380
what, what your thoughts and process were about that in a

407
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,540
future? Yeah. And it's also your cutting boards, your, your oven

408
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,180
setup, your accessibility to what you have. Yeah, I'll get

409
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,780
into and hygiene and how to real hygiene is when you're preparing

410
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,640
food and why. Let's get to the potato salad.

411
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,480
Oh, yeah, sure. Let's get to the potatoes or potato salad. But I

412
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,860
think it's very important to remember that if you don't have

413
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,220
an effective set of tools, I mean, the quality of your work is

414
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,580
going to be limited if you have limited tools. So

415
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,300
well, so yeah, if you don't have a good knife set or a good knife,

416
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,860
there are certain things you just can't do. Like when I give

417
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,540
the rice number eight, you know, when you cut the carrot burdock

418
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,660
on a bias real thin, and then and then match stick it again, you

419
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,880
can't do that with a dull knife, you'll cut yourself, it'll flip

420
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,840
all over the place, it'll take you an hour to cut half a

421
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,200
carrot. Yeah, that's the other thing. So cutting carrots, you

422
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,860
know, I mean, what are you doing? You know, it's going to

423
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,760
take a long time. And yeah, you could indeed hurt yourself. So I

424
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,540
would make pesto and sauces years ago, the we had a food

425
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,000
processor here. And so we split it, I took half the ingredients

426
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,360
you with the food processor me with the knife and the cutting

427
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,900
board, let's see who's done faster. Obviously, by the time

428
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,540
they push the button and got all the ingredients in the food

429
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,960
processor to make the pesto, they were done before me. But I

430
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,040
said, ah, you got to clean that thing now. And by the time they

431
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,000
cleaned and put it away, I was done before they were, you know

432
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
what I mean? Because you know, the food process, you got to

433
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,800
take the thing apart. It's got the canister, the blade, the

434
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,820
spindle, right? Right. Try not to cut yourself while you're

435
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,940
watching this stupid, crazy blade shapes, too. That's

436
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,620
another way. Yeah. So what I'm doing is I was faster. In other

437
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,620
words, they by the time they got I was done. And how long did

438
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,180
it take for me to clean the cutting board and the knife?

439
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,900
Well, you know, a couple of swipes, dry towel, done. Right.

440
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,060
And no, and I was just and also the energy and then put that

441
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,600
electric motor energy in there. So let's get to the potatoes.

442
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,860
Yeah, what I what I did was I got what's called like a yellow

443
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,940
gold potato, but the creamy ones are slightly larger, the

444
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,140
smaller yellow gold or denser waxier, these are non waxy,

445
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,160
they're called yellow potato creamy. Okay. Okay. So I started

446
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,200
with a bunch of those, let's say I have at least like three

447
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,720
potatoes, four potatoes, five potatoes, whatever, right. And

448
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,800
guess what, if you guys have not been around for a while, I do

449
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,480
this thing called stove top baked, where the potato, by the

450
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,820
way, when you get a potato, and it looks dirt, that's not dirt on

451
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,460
the outside, that's humate. So those are humides. It's not soil.

452
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,260
It's not like, oh, it's dirt, you know, it's not. So you could

453
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,260
scrub them, clean them off, right. But that's a humus, a

454
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,320
humus or humus. It's a humate. It's a it's a humate that grows

455
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,460
as the potato grows, it actually transmutes some of the soil to

456
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,920
humate around it, right? That's what it is, right? Think of it

457
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,120
like dead skin cells or something, you know, it's, it's,

458
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,760
it's not dirt, you know, like soil, you know, so anyway, so

459
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,940
your movement, just really quickly, your movement is

460
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,620
disrupting your signal a little bit, just a little bit. Oh, I'm

461
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,800
not moving. Oh, maybe I just went outside maybe earlier.

462
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,760
Maybe that's what's a struggle. Okay, I'm gonna move. I'm gonna

463
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
move around a little bit. Hopefully, it won't disrupt it.

464
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,920
Now, the last recording we did, I lost you for about a minute. I

465
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,860
didn't say anything, we kept going. I figured I was on a

466
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,580
thought there. And so I tend not to bring it up as much because I

467
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,340
know we have problems, but it ends up being sometimes it ends

468
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,540
up being fine on the recording, usually. Oh, I know.

469
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,360
But that was you literally like breaking up like,

470
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,740
okay, like,

471
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,640
real time. Okay, so I got these yellow potatoes, put them in a

472
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,580
pot with just to cover with water and salt. And basically 20

473
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,460
minutes is fine. After they come to a boil, you bring them down

474
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,160
to a low and I do the ghetto pressure cooker, which is a

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,720
weight, a weighted mug and a lead weight on the lid, right?

476
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,020
Very low. 20 minutes, check it to see if it's tender, dump the

477
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,880
water out, or you know, take the potatoes out, dump the water,

478
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,260
put the potatoes back in, turn the flame on low for a few

479
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,320
minutes. And with no water in there, got to be careful, you

480
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,220
got to have a thick bottom pot. If you don't have a thick bottom

481
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,920
pot, get yourself what's called a heat diffuser that will save

482
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,240
you from burning stuff. And it also creates more even heat. Five

483
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,420
minutes with the lid on. Five minutes rest, take the lid off,

484
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,580
let all the steam and repeat that once or twice again, and you end

485
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,840
up and rotate the potatoes. So now you end up with a baked

486
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,000
potato flavor and texture. I mean, when you do that stovetop

487
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,440
bake that I just mentioned, it tastes like you know, that baked

488
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,060
potato flavor, right? You know, it's much better than a boiled

489
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,120
potato flavor, right? Yeah, but you end up getting it, you know,

490
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,040
what the tiny I mean, think about someone the average kitchen

491
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,640
burner, how small how little fuel that uses compared to

492
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,260
firing up an oven. Don't say microwave. Because that's like

493
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,560
the big hit in the 80s. Everyone got a microwave because it made

494
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,820
perfect baked potatoes. I disagree. I always thought that

495
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,840
was crap. The only thing the microwave is good for is

496
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,280
popcorn to me. But yeah, maybe Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I had

497
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,340
gotten one. I remember in 1988. The family brought me in my

498
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,760
house living in Manhattan. They brought me a microwave. After

499
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,460
they left, I put it out on the curb. You know, Merry Christmas,

500
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,340
right? So anyway, snatch that up about five minutes. Yeah, not

501
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,520
even Yeah, I didn't even actually I went in. So I'm going

502
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,980
to wait five minutes now that it's gone. Guess what? It was

503
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,420
gone. This is 11th Street between second and third Avenue

504
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,860
in Manhattan 1988. Yes, definitely gone. Good. Yeah.

505
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,340
Yeah. So

506
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,240
alright, so we got the stove top baked potato. Basically, what

507
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,420
we do let them cool down. And you peel them by you just you

508
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,080
don't use a peeler, the skin just comes off. And I was

509
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,820
thinking when I was peeling these potatoes, you know, people

510
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,340
say onion skin is real thin. Oh my gosh, if you think onion skin

511
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,100
is thin, you got to try potato skin that's much thinner than

512
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,140
onion skin. But anyway,

513
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,340
not barely you pinch it, you can just take it off with your

514
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,720
fingers. Yeah, you take it off with your finger. You could use

515
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,960
a utensil just to start you know, pulling I use a popsicle sticks

516
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,740
to whatever you know, the back edge of a small blade, a fork,

517
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,180
whatever. Alright, set them aside. Okay, now what I have on

518
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,700
the other side is prior to doing that, while the potatoes were

519
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,980
cooking, I quartered an onion, I took a quarter of the onion. And

520
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,800
I cut it in half again. So it's about you know, it's a wedge,

521
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,460
but it's about one inch on one end, turn on the burner, and I

522
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,880
put the onion right on the burner. And I'm burning the

523
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,300
onion basically char charring it on one side and the other. And

524
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,640
just like you're making as if you're making far you know, the

525
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,720
Vietnamese soup, you char the onion and and I have a carrot

526
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,620
that's charring also don't rinse it, you know, once the the

527
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,560
onion and the carrot cool, I chop up the onion in a chop. So

528
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,400
I chopped this quarter inch by quarter inch, put it in a bowl

529
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,480
and you add some sugar, you got to do this in this order. First

530
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,940
you put you salt the onion, a good amount of salt, what you

531
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,420
more than what you would salt to taste. And then you cover it

532
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,380
with vinegar, your vinegar of your choice, always use a good

533
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,960
quality vinegar, stir it around. And I also cut the carrot very,

534
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,080
very thin on a biased and match sticks very thin match sticks,

535
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,860
right? And excited with the onions.

536
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,120
Particular vinegar, like a red wine vinegar, any quality red

537
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,320
wine vinegar, I have an organic one. You can also use a rice

538
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,540
wine vinegar if you like that. Okay, fair enough. Right. Yeah.

539
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,260
And this what you're making there is a pressed salad pickle

540
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,740
with the onion and carrot. What I do is I've had a small bowl, I

541
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,860
put some cling wrap over it and a weight, you know, lid or another

542
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,860
mug or something to press it down, just enough vinegar to

543
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,020
cover even less and stir it up. And salt, you would you know, if

544
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,760
I said put salt on something, you know, you salted to taste,

545
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,260
this is not salting to taste, this is literally adding a

546
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,760
couple of pinches of salt, right? And the vinegar, what

547
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,240
that does is the vinegar and the salt and the sulfur in the onion,

548
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,260
what does it mean sulfur in the onion, you know, that strong,

549
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,920
raw onion taste, that's an organic sulfur. Those three

550
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,100
combinations, the acidic acid, the salt and the they form a new

551
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,200
flavor, they all cancel each other out. And if you've never

552
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,620
done this before, if you really heavily salt the chopped onion,

553
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,560
add the vinegar, stir it up, and just put your finger and taste

554
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,860
it, it doesn't taste like onion, it doesn't taste like vinegar,

555
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,320
it doesn't taste like salt, you've just created this new

556
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,300
flavor. And most people have never had that. And it's it's

557
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,280
like a relish. Almost, you know how a relish doesn't taste like

558
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,180
pickle, it doesn't taste like relish, right?

559
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,320
You know, I've had something like this. And it's kind of

560
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,680
sweet, right?

561
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,500
It can be it can be even though it's very salted. Okay, so you

562
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,800
put this aside, it's a pickle. Now, we have some raisins also

563
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,420
maybe two tablespoons of raisins, and I've softened them and put

564
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,940
them on the cutting board, just do a liberal chopping of the

565
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,080
raisins, right? Okay. Okay, so now you have your potatoes

566
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,780
cooling. And hopefully they're cool enough. They're peeled. What

567
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,660
I do is I cut them in thirds one way, lay them down, cut them

568
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,440
in thirds again, and then they end up looking like cubes about

569
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,840
half inch by three quarter, less than a cube. It's there. They

570
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
look like a quarter of a potato, but it's thinner than it is wide

571
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,420
and long, right? You don't want a cube. You want it slightly like

572
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,660
a thick slice, but they're small pieces. Right. So what I have now

573
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,760
is a bowl with some baby kale and baby spinach greens. All

574
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,180
right, I've rinsed that out in the bowl. And what I do is a

575
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,400
pressed salad. What you do is once it's rinsed out, you put it

576
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,920
in the bowl, put some olive oil over it, and just grab it with

577
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,960
your hand and mush it and just keep moving it around until you

578
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,680
just crush once or twice the vegetables and they'll get that

579
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,200
dark green broken leaf color almost wilted but not wilted.

580
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,300
It's a broken leaf, right? You don't want the because a fresh

581
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,520
leaf whether it's lettuce or spinach, whatever, it's very

582
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,760
springy. You know, I mean spring like a spring that moves, right?

583
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,680
And it's hard to get a hold of when you make a pressed salad

584
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,680
when you press it down, it looks wilted, but it's wilted

585
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,080
mechanically and broken. The leaves don't have that perfect

586
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,140
shape. They're all wrinkled up and they turn a dark green,

587
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,860
right? This is this is makes a much better chew. It's easier to

588
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,740
pick up. It changes the flavor as well. Okay, so now we're

589
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,360
going to go to how do you prepare the salad, you start

590
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,220
cutting your potatoes on the cutting board, the way we said

591
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,920
you lay them out with a little bit of olive oil, you want to

592
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,340
use a little bit of olive oil on the potatoes and the knife

593
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,180
because the starch makes it very sticky. So always have some

594
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,300
olive oil ready to go. Before you even start cutting the

595
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,460
potato, pour a little olive oil over the potato. So as you're

596
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,180
slicing it, the excess lubricant, right, as opposed to

597
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,100
getting that very thick, starchy stickiness, which will

598
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,720
also contribute to the breaking of the pieces.

599
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,500
Quick thought, isn't it good to have olive oil in a spray bottle

600
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,080
sort of so you can spray it out?

601
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,620
You could do that. For some reason that changes the taste

602
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,540
that I don't like it.

603
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,920
Okay,

604
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,120
so get handy, you know, there's a little pour top thing or

605
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,220
whatever you could use or Yeah.

606
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,040
That's the ones I have with a little pour top with a little

607
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,920
should be fine. It's usually the pour top that hides under the

608
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,600
cap is too big. Usually it pours out too much. So you make your

609
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,400
own or whatever you can use the ones that use in the bar use that

610
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,300
pour top, you know, the in the bar, they have the the hard

611
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,040
liquor pour tops, right, right. The pointy ones use those. You

612
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,840
could buy three pack of those real cheap. Yeah, that's and

613
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,700
they're 28 millimeter or 32 millimeter bottles is usually

614
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,560
standard. Okay, so now you lay out your potatoes and as the

615
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,800
potatoes are laid out on the cutting board, go ahead and put

616
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,720
your onion and carrot mixture over the potatoes as they are in

617
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,880
the cutting board, and then put your raisins spread them out.

618
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,160
All right, and then take the wilted baby kale and spinach and

619
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,900
spread that out. So now you're looking at a cutting board, it's

620
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
you know, the full width and length of the cutting boards

621
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,840
covered with chopped potatoes and the layer of onions and a

622
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,719
layer of raisin and then the greens on top. Why do I do this?

623
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,420
Because now when I transfer from the cutting board to the bowl as

624
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,500
it falls off the cutting board, it's already partially mixed,

625
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,699
right? Because if you're going to throw these ingredients one at

626
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,420
a time in a bowl and try to mix it, what is that mechanical

627
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,699
mixing going to do to your potatoes, it's going to start

628
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,260
smashing all the edges, beating them up, and the potatoes are

629
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,199
going to beat them and they're going to start being partial

630
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,739
mash, right? So one thing that I'll get into is you want to

631
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,940
start your mixing process on the cutting board, right? No

632
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,480
matter what it is, if even if you're making a tuna salad, you

633
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,159
know, you add mayo, whatever tuna salad, whatever, if you're

634
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,679
cutting vegetables, start adding your dressings and other

635
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,400
things on the cutting board if you can, because as it transfers

636
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,840
from the cutting board into the bowl, it's already half mixed

637
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,040
and you've saved yourself or you've retained the original

638
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,100
shape and texture or the stuff that you see in a food magazine

639
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,080
is how do they get it looking so perfect? Well, they didn't beat

640
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,880
it up. That's why, right? The economy of movement. So and also

641
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,120
you have some vinegar mixture leftover. You can add that to

642
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,580
the entire thing. Now, if to taste now, this is where the

643
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,120
taste comes in. So the even getting it off the cutting board

644
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,080
into the bowl is not going to guarantee a full mix. So I have

645
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,400
it in the bowl. I have another bowl or remember the pot that

646
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,740
you made the potatoes in? You rinse that out and you transfer

647
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,980
it from the bowl into the pot again very gently. Okay, I see a

648
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,820
lot of young novice cooks when they make something like a salad

649
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,020
or a mix. They get in there with a big spoon and what do they do?

650
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,320
Right? You know, just like television. They start moving

651
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,880
the thing. Yeah, yeah, you don't do that. The best way to mix is

652
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,560
to transfer from container to container let and gentle gravity

653
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,800
and the tumbling will actually give you a wonderful mix and

654
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,580
still retaining the look and the ingredients. And there you go.

655
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,800
This is a five star meal. If you put this together, and you slice

656
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,500
the meat thin, and you and also I have some very peppery

657
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,800
horseradish that comes already in a jar. Fresh ground

658
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,360
horseradish is the best. And whenever you have horseradish,

659
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,340
by the way, that comes pickled in a jar, you know, with brine,

660
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,840
you want to have a small strainer, don't spoon it out

661
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,080
onto whatever mixture or serve it, you always want to put it

662
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,740
in a strainer and drain it. If you don't have a strainer, you

663
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,120
could use a small towel or some dry it off, right. And I mixed

664
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,040
that with some sour cream. So it's a creamy horseradish on the

665
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,660
side, which goes well with the potato salad, and the beef. And

666
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,040
if you put these two dishes together, it is a five star end

667
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,640
of summer steak dinner.

668
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,220
There you have it.
