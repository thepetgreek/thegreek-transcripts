1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,680
Greek, you know where I'm going with this, don't you?

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,680
Israel, okay, and the use of the word war, even coming from the prime minister,

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,780
people talking about it, there's clearly something happening there.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,080
So the instant question that I got about five or six times already,

6
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,000
is this what the Greek was talking about yet?

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,680
No, but it's letting you know.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,460
Go ahead. Do you remember, was it a few months ago you were bringing up something

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,900
and I said it was a nothing burger. Do you remember that?

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,320
Yeah, it was it was about a month and a half ago.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,960
And what I was talking about is the the whole thing with the military

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,100
and people didn't want to serve because they didn't like that.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,080
You know, the the leadership and there was a problem with the courts.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,680
And I said, it looks like there's some unrest because there was some civil,

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,820
you know, unrest that was being broadcast. Right.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,800
People were resisting. And of course, that society is interwoven.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,400
The military, the civil part of it, the religious part of it is all

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
very intensely connected as far as I can observe from a distance

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,860
because I haven't been to Israel. Have you ever been to Israel?

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,260
No, but I just communicated with someone recently who spent about a month there

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,520
just recently. OK, fair enough.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,440
Their comments to me was thanks for all your prognostication,

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,860
everything you've been saying. I saw personally when he was there.

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,400
And what that really was, was the military is in disarray,

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,940
the disenchantment of the people and how things are not the way

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,520
they are told. Right. And yeah, what I'm talking about is the

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,760
is the World War three kind of scenario that people are talking.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,160
By the way, World War three is not going to be at all like World War two.

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,260
It'll be a series of events that will just be a blanket over society.

30
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,080
But there's no such thing as nuclear war, by the way.

31
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,180
It's already been decided. When you say World War three,

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,020
you think of nukes. Right. But a lot of that's not a tangent.

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,040
Yeah, but yeah, that's not you can't you can fire off more than one nuke

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,540
at a time, guys within range. You know, it's not like the Terminator

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,780
where you see nuke going off and nuke going off or Battlestar Galactico

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,680
or Armageddon. You fire one nuke and the next nuke, you have to wait

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,840
quite a bit, at least a half an hour. Right. So anyway,

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,300
and they don't really work well. They just make a really bad hotspot

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,480
and you rely on a radius and there's a lot better ways to kill people.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,600
And the best way to get people to kill the best way to kill people is

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,900
having volunteer. Well, I've always said, you know, even when people

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,740
were talking about they're going to round us up, they're going to.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,080
And I would always shake my head at that. That's nonsense.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,580
It's a waste of time and effort and energy.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,060
You can just get people to kill each other right where they are.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,840
They don't got to be around injections. It's called pharmaceuticals.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,100
It's called by, you know, your food. It's slow.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,940
All that slow. It's more manageable when it's slow.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,260
All that. Plus, if you need something done a little quicker,

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,840
you just turn people against one another and they'll do it for you.

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,040
You know, that's that's the thing. You don't have to make the effort.

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,240
If you're the big controller, if you're the guy looking at this as a chessboard,

53
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,940
what is the best thing to do? Not to go and attack the other chess pieces,

54
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,260
but to put them in a position so that they have no other choice

55
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,720
but to offer themselves up for sacrifice. I mean, that's the way I play chess.

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,240
Yeah. But by the way, for nuclear, they've already did the nuclear prototype,

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,240
you know, front lines engaged with nukes.

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,780
That was in sixty nine. Seventy was the Sino-Soviet war

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,580
where the Chinese were fighting the Soviets over the border.

60
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,260
And it's also classified. If you go to State Department,

61
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,580
they do listings of battles and things that they've sent monitors to to watch.

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,000
And it's also classified because they did a nuclear exchange back and forth,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,240
like, you know, tactical linebreaker type nukes. Right.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,480
OK, it did work. And you could also it was also very well proven at that time.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,660
You know, everything downwind, all the lung cancer people were getting in the U.S.

66
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,940
right from cigarette smokes. Ha ha ha. Yeah, it wasn't from that at all.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,940
It was from the ionized particles in the air. But from that war,

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,680
you could look up the Sino-Soviet war.

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,400
Sixty nine. Seventy is very little information, even though there was three million

70
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,900
people involved fighting or two million on each side.

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah. And forget about smoking. You can take a look up at the even just,

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,160
you know, out there publicly, the downwind babies. OK, because all the testing.

73
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,480
Right. They said, yeah, downwind cancer in different places.

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,600
Even John Wayne, you know, the whole thing with John Wayne. Right.

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,620
Like he died of cancer. And the whole thing was that that one movie he filmed

76
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,560
was right there on one of the one of the testing sites.

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,460
So it's like, yeah, of course, it's right downwind from the testing site.

78
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,180
So him and I don't know, everybody that worked on that production pretty much

79
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,160
if it was active, here's the thing. They got everyone so afraid of it.

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,900
The way you get cancer from nuclear stuff is when you breathe in the ionized

81
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,960
particles and they're stuck in lung tissue, let's say, or ear to ear canals

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,000
or places, you know, where they irradiate you night and day for a few days

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,660
or weeks, not not being around a sun lamp.

84
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,220
You know, I mean, you get a low rentage and count on a high UV situation.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,620
But anyway, all that stuff is never going to be.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
So not going on a tangent about Israel.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,940
I have not looked at the news at all.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,560
I actually just went into the room to get some coffee ready.

89
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,020
And I put on the last YouTube posted about Israel and I walked out of the room.

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,200
So I just to see what was going on.

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,040
So I literally still don't know what's going on other than what's been posted

92
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,940
in the chat and what I've gotten two or three mass private messages

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,720
with headlines, which I didn't click on. So I really don't know what's going on.

94
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,140
The last thing I saw was like 300 rockets and all that.

95
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,380
So it's the same stuff. Hamas, the terrorist, whatever.

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,060
Yeah, that was that was about yesterday at daylight is when that started.

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,460
And daylight is about to come back around to that area again as we speak.

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,580
So I'm assuming, you know, I mean, look, it's it's easier to shoot things

99
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,880
in the daylight than it is at night.

100
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,800
I know night vision, blah, blah, blah.

101
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,740
But just saying it's simpler to do stuff in the daylight, isn't it?

102
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,840
Yeah. Daylight creatures. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah. I would suggest that.

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,380
Yeah, this is the beginning of what I kind of know.

105
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,880
Breaking down period. Right. Fall. Right.

106
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,800
I did bring this up before the year is out.

107
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
And by the way, it is another thing.

108
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,800
The quote unquote Jewish calendar is very close to the lawful calendar,

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,980
except they're doing dark moon.

110
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,880
Because I noticed when was the Jewish New Year this year?

111
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,660
It was already in September, which is the seventh month, which is proper.

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Right. They still don't have the right. It's not lawful.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
It can't be. They can't do that.

114
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,040
Because what happens when you instruct people lawfully,

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,280
it opens them up to so many other things.

116
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,240
And how are you going to. Right.

117
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,240
You know, it's a consciousness change. Right.

118
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,180
Yes. Well, that was the thing I told you about.

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,160
Just recognizing that the day begins at, you know, the solar noon.

120
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,740
Even that is a consciousness change for me.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,020
And I didn't make a lot of changes.

122
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,640
I just allowed that to seep in as a.

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,700
I mean, I'm using a personal experience.

124
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,760
But I assure you that if you do something as simple as that,

125
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,780
it will make a change in the consciousness.

126
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,820
Sure. A higher consciousness can always contain a lower consciousness.

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,720
Right. So when you're caught, that's a much higher form of consciousness.

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,940
When you go to understand these things.

129
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,780
And then when you go back and look at the concept of midnight,

130
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
that's obviously a much lower form designed to be, by the way,

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,080
a lower form because it's contradictory and all that.

132
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,060
And it's antithetical to the way we live. Right.

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,300
And so on and so forth. And also the people that put it out.

134
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Right. What they intended to do with that.

135
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Right. So you contain that and you see that and you say, oh, yeah, I was I was there once.

136
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Right. And you move forward and you're at a much at a higher place.

137
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,080
Yes. Qualitatively higher. Right.

138
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,860
But anyway, going back to it, I did mention a lot of this stuff this year that.

139
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,980
And it's going to be it's going to be like the gang of Israel, the army.

140
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,260
What would I like to stress more? Because these things happen often.

141
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,760
Right. Every you could count on one of these things happening every five years.

142
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,940
You know where they lob a bunch of rockets over. Right.

143
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,840
Well, see, this happens often. But if you track it, it's this is different.

144
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,559
I can tell that already.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,500
I feel I'll tell you without looking at anything or fielding any of the stuff they're putting out.

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,980
It's so it's it seems when the media grabs onto something like this, it's preplanned. Right.

147
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,100
The script is written. Sometimes, you know, they give the script out before the event happens. Right.

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,500
Yeah. No, I get that part. But there's something else happening here.

149
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,340
I don't know how to explain that. I have this feeling that this is different.

150
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,680
Not, you know, and I've seen it before. And look over the past.

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,660
You can track it. You know, you can take a look at the casualties,

152
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,100
exactly what happened on one side or the other in the occupied territory.

153
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,600
You can go through this all different ways that that information is all out there.

154
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,920
No. Yeah. It's information that can't be trusted, by the way.

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,900
Sure. Yeah. But you have to reckon what how are they showing it to you?

156
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,420
Yeah. What they're saying and how they're saying it. That's anything you see.

157
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,840
So it's this is this has got all the tales of a preplanned event.

158
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Mm hmm. Both in other words. OK, what does he mean?

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,160
The Israelis knew this is not a surprise. Here's the thing.

160
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,140
Remember a few months ago, I said first reaction, by the way, that's the weirdest thing is that was my first reaction,

161
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,120
because the big headline initially was big surprise.

162
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Nobody knew this was coming. This is it. And I went, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

163
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,980
Because then I heard and I knew I was going to hear it before they started saying it.

164
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,160
It's a failure of intelligence, Greg. Yeah, of course.

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,660
Yeah. Right. Which means it's an intelligence success. Yeah. Right.

166
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,460
So please continue. Well, one of the things that I mentioned to look for,

167
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,160
one of the tells may or may not, but look for anyway,

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,580
is how many dignitaries would have been out of the country when this begins.

169
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,100
Now, that's something that that the current news reporting is muddied up.

170
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,000
In other words, if you search how many Israeli dignitaries left like the past few days or a week ago,

171
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,040
it's very muddied up. You're not going to get that information.

172
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,060
You know what I mean? Well, right. Well, unless you know someone that, you know,

173
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,840
has got their finger on that pulse, you know.

174
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,120
But I would suggest that anybody who's anyone knew about this

175
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
and suddenly had to go vacation that I was going to say Morocco, but maybe not.

176
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,960
But you know what I mean? They're out of the country or, you know, they're in a safe place.

177
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,300
Where does Hamas get all this ordinance? Right. Same place Israel does. Right.

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, that's another funny thing, because, you know, allegedly this strip is blockaded.

179
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,620
And of course, it's surrounded on all three sides.

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,600
If you take a look by people that are not exactly going to be friendly to them,

181
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,940
importing anything and you have a blockade on the water.

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,260
How is it you get, you know, the first claim dozens.

183
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,580
Then they said hundreds of rockets, which is a lot as opposed to just.

184
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,180
Yeah. But I said they're not improvised devices. Right.

185
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,520
No, no, no, no. These are, you know, and they're even trying to say already that the technology is.

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,920
But, you know, so, again, I'm looking at what they're saying, not trusting it,

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,760
but understanding that it can be revelatory anyway. Right.

188
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,340
Yeah. What form of should show it is, you know, is it going to win an Oscar?

189
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,680
How many rotten tomatoes does this one get? Right. Oh, yeah. Right.

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,560
Is it just going to be something to fill time on the weekends?

191
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,580
You know, is it just part of the Saturday cartoon run or is it going to be primetime?

192
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah. Let me just read. Well, let me just reiterate primetime or not.

193
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,260
I think this will be primetime. What I'm going to say.

194
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,000
We're looking at casualties on the Palestinian side in the tens of thousands, not a few hundred.

195
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,420
That's the what that's the event that I'm talking about.

196
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,080
Yeah, well, that's the tens, tens of thousands, not a thousand, not two thousand, not not nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine,

197
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,100
but over ten thousand plus many times.

198
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,140
That's the event that I was talking about that would change the, you know, the entire scenario.

199
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:22,580
I don't think this is it. You're talking about in one day, in one action or you say it within one, let's say, campaign, like within a few weeks.

200
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:30,340
Well, depending on how possible, depending on how they would considering that they have declared that they're they're at war

201
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,720
and they are looking for vengeance and they are looking to strike and they're doing all these things and talking about wiping.

202
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,800
Yeah, the first words. Yeah, we've all heard them.

203
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes. But we haven't heard these in a while from there. Exactly.

204
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,400
It's usually, look, we're going to defend ourselves. We're going to protect ourselves.

205
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,120
We deserve to protect ourselves. We deserve to exist. And we're going to do so.

206
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,720
That's usually the rhetoric. This rhetoric is a little different.

207
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah, I know. This one's more like we're going to fight for the sake of fighting now.

208
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,820
It seems like it seems like. Yeah. I mean, look, I'm just presenting.

209
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,520
Yeah, I don't know. It might be. It may not be. You know, here's the thing.

210
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,720
I wish the best to everyone. It's sad when these things happen.

211
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,180
But, you know, the sooner these things take place and are gone, the sooner we get maybe our ticket out of this place.

212
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,000
But but anyway, that's another discussion. Here's the thing that I've always brought up.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,540
What you're going to be looking for is a conflict that's going to be so bad between the Palestinians and Israel that it's going to change the the map literally.

214
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,760
And it's going to result in a very strong alliance. Is this it?

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:43,220
I don't know. Let's just sit back and watch. But thanks for giving me some credit on a heads up on this, because I sense that from all the private messages that I've gotten.

216
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm the only one really talking about more specifics, because if you tell anyone the Palestinians and Israelis are going to go into a war.

217
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,480
Well, the bear shit in the woods. Right. Yeah.

218
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:03,580
But giving specifics about how the Israeli army has been downgraded internally, what you'll hear, I assure you, is the Israeli army or IDF.

219
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,880
I think it's Israel Defense League, the Israeli Defense Force.

220
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,820
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you'll hear later, as we were given these bizarre, nonsensical orders.

221
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,160
Right. You know, maneuvers and things. And we were like, well, who said this?

222
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:26,460
Right. And they either will not follow them because they're just bizarre or no orders or a mutiny or, you know, in disarray.

223
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,660
You know, what's a what do you call a military in disarray?

224
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:39,360
You know, basically, is what you will see on the Israeli side, not this precision strike and these, quote, unquote, miraculous battle outcomes that you saw in the previous wars in the 60s.

225
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,660
You know, where, you know, two Israeli tanks defeat 100 Syrian tanks.

226
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,500
You know, you know, you've heard those right.

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,580
The crazy six day war thing where we're with nothing.

228
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,020
They took down entire. Yeah, right. OK.

229
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,420
Yeah. You know, nothing like this is the opposite. This is where the they all got the thumbs up their ass and it's the gang that couldn't shoot straight.

230
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,180
You know, we had rubber bullets, you know, just, you know, we're giving an order to do this, which is stupid.

231
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,260
You know, yeah. Yeah. Nothing's going to make any sense.

232
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,200
The kind of thing where they're going to get beat with slingshots, even though they've got, you know, state of the art infantry weapons, this kind of thing.

233
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,140
Yeah. Kind of like what they did on 9-11 when they wanted to deploy jets.

234
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,640
And the reason they didn't deploy jets is because there was no jets to deploy to chase.

235
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,440
Right. So the fewer people you do that.

236
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:32,380
So anyway, I mean, there were jets, but not they all were going to what's that airfield in Massachusetts, Westover.

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:45,340
Yeah. Right. So, yeah, you're not going to deploy jets to intercept commercial airliners that are already scheduled to land at a military base flying at an altitude of 400 feet.

238
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,200
You don't do that. Right. So it's going to be along those ridiculous lines. Right.

239
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,940
Why are we letting that. Right. So, yeah, it's all ridiculous.

240
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,840
But the one that again, the one that I'm talking about is going to be very, very dark day for both.

241
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Both a lot. We're talking about casualties, you know, maybe a hundred thousand even.

242
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:12,620
Well, I'm curious about this because I have seen some reports and then they seem to stop about the possibility of this.

243
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,220
This is the first time I've ever seen this, actually. Maybe they'll actually use the nukes, which you brought up to begin with.

244
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:26,080
No one. Well, they're tactical. If they use if anything is ever used here, just interrupt for a moment.

245
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,900
Well, it would be stupid to use anything else larger than that on the Gaza Strip just based on geography.

246
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,600
It's not it's already been determined since the 1980s to not use these atmospherically.

247
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,480
Right. But I'm just saying because of the moral consequences that people have.

248
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,540
But you couldn't use anything of any substantial size in Gaza unless you're going to destroy things outside.

249
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,800
It'll cover Gaza. Well, the way they have been.

250
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,780
You know, if I told you a thousand nukes have been fired off since the 1980s, but no one knows it because they're classified as car bombs.

251
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,960
OK. Right. And they're not in the car. They're underneath the car, in the ground, in the sewer or buried the day before.

252
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,000
Right. So I would suggest, yes, a thousand nukes could be used in this conflict, but not atmospheric.

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,099
Well, that's how you get a 10 foot deep crater under a car that really just lost the bottom of it.

254
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,980
You know, it's like, wait a minute. The only car is gone.

255
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,619
But if you do the math, it needed it was 10 tons of dynamite.

256
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,280
You know, so which you remember, you need a freight train to carry that.

257
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:32,720
Yeah. So thousands of nukes have been maybe in the thousands, but definitely over a thousand nukes have been used in the past 40 years.

258
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,900
Touted as car bombs and terrorist bombings and things like that.

259
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,140
And they're always non atmospheric, meaning they just have to be covered under the ground or inside something.

260
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,620
So the initial flash is not seen because remember, nukes do not explode.

261
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,100
They detonate and the reaction is based on the environment.

262
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,440
Right. So Fukushima, Three Mile Island.

263
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,380
What's the one Chernobyl? All those are little micro nukes.

264
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:13,560
Right. So all those things that you see, these car bombs, you know, that leave these 30 foot craters, these assassinations, these buildings during even during wartime, you know, say, oh, my gosh, that was a big blast.

265
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,340
And there's quite a few of them on YouTube from the Iraq War still.

266
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,200
Right. You know, they're never atmospheric.

267
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:32,420
They could be. I'm sure they have a containment system where, in other words, the actual bomb, the weapon casing itself can shield some of that initial reaction.

268
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,580
I doubt it, but possible. So they're going to be used as, you know, you know, whatever.

269
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:54,960
Use your imagination. But what I'm talking about is something that will change the relationship for indefinitely between those two countries or peoples and bring them close together with mass casualties, mostly on the Palestinian side.

270
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:08,720
And, of course, is, you know, here, if you're killing 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 Palestinians while that killing is going on, there's it's going to retaliate into the hundreds, tens of hundreds and maybe even thousands of Israelis as well.

271
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,220
They're not going to sit there and say, shoot us. Right. Right. So it's going to result in casualties on both sides, but mostly heavy on the Palestinians.

272
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,520
And that's what I've been talking about for the past 20 years, not and specifically decade is what you will see.

273
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:32,060
But what what brought this on this year is looking at this, the timing that it's time for this conflict to somehow begin or made foreshadowed.

274
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,300
So is this it? I don't know. I don't I'm not sensing it, but it is.

275
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,100
It has all the marks of a modern media production, though, produced for the media.

276
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,940
And, of course, someone will say, Greek, what an asshole, man.

277
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,820
They kill 500 people or we mean media production.

278
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,680
Yeah. Yeah. You know, 500 people killed or a thousand people killed for a media production is nothing, you know.

279
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,500
Right. Well, and the other thing is that it resonates.

280
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,580
Right. Because then people that are sympathetic or people that are related to some of those people that wind up dying that are living elsewhere.

281
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:10,460
Well, they might just take a little bit of issue with it. And therefore, see, that's the thing that that's why I want to get to the final question on this.

282
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,500
And then I'll shut up, which is and these are all based on your guys messages and questions.

283
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,680
So I appreciate it. And I put them together here.

284
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:26,040
You know, the Middle East Union, which you have brought up previously on other Sonics, we haven't really discussed it on Rated Y.

285
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,780
But of course, this started those questions.

286
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,740
Is this one of the and what I what I would think immediately, and I'm not sure if you believe this and I'm putting it to you.

287
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,620
Is this kind of like the the pre show?

288
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,140
I would say I would say at least, yeah, the pre show.

289
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:53,560
In other words, to soften people's minds that because of an event, other countries start being allies or what have you support group rights to support.

290
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,400
And they stay supportive even after the battle is gone.

291
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,500
And when I say Middle East Union, remember, I always qualify.

292
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,040
It'll be a loose Confederacy, not like the EU.

293
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,900
Right. It's not like we have a parliament and everyone, all the member states and nothing like that.

294
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,680
It'll be a loose Confederacy. In other words, they're working together loosely.

295
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,900
But they in fact, they work together in practice so well that might as well be a union.

296
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,060
But it will be a Middle East Union in that way. Yeah.

297
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,300
OK, well, imagine a formal union politically like having you and all the countries don't work together.

298
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,960
Right. Ineffective. It is effective because it's overarching political scheme.

299
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,000
But in this case, it'll be a loose Confederacy.

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,980
Right. But there they will start uniting and things will start centering around there.

301
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,880
So we'll see. I'm actually looking at everything and other input that I'm getting.

302
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,980
So I'll be ready to talk more about that in the near future.

303
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,640
Not not tonight or even next week or next month, because I'm rehashing things from other inputs.

304
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,760
And, you know, I'm if you're a seeker of knowledge, you're a seeker of knowledge.

305
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,820
Right. It's not a seeker. It's not you don't have to necessarily defend things you've said or be apologetic.

306
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,340
You can change your perspective because if you're a seeker of knowledge and you want to share it with other people,

307
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,860
you want to be what as accurate as possible. And, you know, so that's the phase that I'm going through right now.

308
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,640
Right. And legitimately, look, time goes on. New events occur, which add to what is happening.

309
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,280
And there are choices that can be made along the way. Sometimes there's a bit of a multiple choice about it.

310
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:36,180
Right. So it's based on input, you know, because of the input that I've gotten on what I've been talking about for the past two decades

311
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,600
is rather minimal when you compare it just to what's in the biblical text.

312
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:46,980
But when you start to look at more world, a broader viewpoint of what we should be expecting in these, quote unquote, times,

313
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,480
it starts I start to want to make some adjustments. So I'll be talking about that.

314
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,740
So fair enough. Plus, you know, new terminology, new emerging individuals could be there.

315
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,620
I mean, people that weren't even born at the time.

316
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,200
Yeah, but the terminology, look, but rose by any other name is still a rose.

317
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,820
So we want to keep state to the subject matter more than the terminology.

318
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,040
But, yeah, I get what you're saying. OK, fair enough.

319
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,540
So with that, I mean, is there anything else that we should be looking at?

320
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,280
I mean, would you suggest that anybody keeps an eye on anything in particular?

321
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,220
If we're still here next week or the next time we record. Right. You always got to say that.

322
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,920
Fair enough. So we don't we don't want to seem like we take things for granted, right?

323
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:33,540
No, anything. Look, whether it's, you know, the the mop up crew comes through or I get hit by.

324
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, we get surely those that are deserving will have their fair share of information for when that's going to happen.

325
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,680
They won't happen now. But but yeah, let's say what I'll do.

326
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,580
I have not even spend one stitch or five seconds looking at anything by the next recording.

327
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,620
What I'll do is I'll review what has transpired and in the next few days and I'll give more of an overview review of what I think,

328
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,560
you know, this is my assessment of what's going on over the next few days.

329
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,180
How's that? That's quite fair. Thank you. And point out whatever I think should be pointed out.

330
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,280
Appreciate it. I do. And I'm sure that some people that are paying attention to the Sonics will appreciate it as well.

331
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,400
Yeah. So with that, what else is on your mind? I mean, because this wasn't really on your mind.

332
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,700
Maybe you have something else you want to go into here.

333
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:33,100
You know, yeah, some interactions I've had this week made me realize that one of the I would say the slogan of rated Y, which is the on culting of humanity.

334
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:42,300
Right. And how do you know you're in a cult? Right. I mean, there's a lot of stuff online, you know, I think before we started recording, I said, hey, you know, you know, Chuck,

335
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,660
everybody's in a cult. But if everybody's in a cult, it doesn't seem like they're in a cult because everybody's in a cult. Right.

336
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,300
So you hear you've heard parents say, oh, my daughter, she's in this cult. She's throwing her life away. Right.

337
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,900
Oh, my son is in the cult. I got to get him out of it. It's really bad for him. Right.

338
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,880
Well, what if the entire human population is in a cult?

339
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,700
That's the trouble, because, look, it's counterintuitive to say everybody's in a cult, because why?

340
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:19,400
Well, as far as I've always been taught, you know, the only difference between a cult and a, you know, organized religion is usually the numbers.

341
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,840
If it's small, they call it a cult. If it gets large enough, then they stop calling it a cult.

342
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:34,200
So, I mean, maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm wrong, but that seems to me to be the only real difference between a cult and a so-called religion, according to the nomenclature.

343
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,660
I mean, isn't cult short for culture?

344
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,340
It sure is to my mind.

345
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,900
Yeah, I'm not like con man is short for confidence, man.

346
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm not sure. Someone once told me cult is short for C-U-N-T. And I was like, no, that doesn't make any sense.

347
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,960
No, unless, you know, I mean, look, your experiences may vary. Of course, you out there.

348
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,860
I mean, it's possible, I guess, if you have an all-female. And anyway, I'm joking.

349
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,500
No, it doesn't make any sense. You know, you could call a C-U-N-T in England. It's a popular term for someone who's annoying.

350
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
Well, yeah, exactly. They are funny with that word.

351
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,160
It doesn't have to be gender-related.

352
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,300
That word flies out of their mouths so easily. I mean, it cracks me up, actually.

353
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,040
Anytime I talk to somebody from over there, it's hilarious to me with how easily they...

354
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,820
Yeah, we use the other terms.

355
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:27,280
Yeah, that and taking a piss are two very funny things that they just flip out there as quickly as, you know,

356
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,660
you and I might, you know, on a very, very rudimentary street level, might just drop the f-word.

357
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,320
Yeah, and we don't make those associations with those words. So, yeah, they have a different association.

358
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:43,940
But anyway, cult. What if the entire population at large, let's say, with a few exceptions, is now part of this cult,

359
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:53,800
you know, as the human cult, which varies, right, by continent, by geographically, and socially, meaning the culture, right, varies.

360
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:03,160
So what happens? How do we examine this? If you start, like I said, this week, experiences interacting with people,

361
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:14,860
several subjects, medical, food, politics, money, and all of the inquiry discussion from their side was all cultish in nature.

362
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,760
There was no reason behind it. It was like they were parroting something that they seen as, you know,

363
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,440
I said most people, when you hear them speaking, especially when you think they're going to get more meaningful,

364
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:35,300
it's still as seen on TV language, right? They can't escape that, right? Because most people were raised by that, right?

365
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,660
And you're exactly right. It is all based on a culture. And by the way, if you take a look at even the language these people use,

366
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,880
they'll say that there is a corporate culture. There is a culture in the monetary system.

367
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,080
There is a culture in this group, that group. Every group has a culture, so to speak.

368
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,380
So, yeah, it seems like a lot of little cults come together to make one big cult, if you subscribe to a bunch of them.

369
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,920
Is that not accurate, or what?

370
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,340
Yeah, but the main franchise is the same. In other words, there is a force behind it.

371
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,500
You have both the detractors and the benefactors. You have both.

372
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,540
But it's mostly detractor. Mostly detractor.

373
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,680
Because very, by the way, it's very easy to turn the entire, all the cultures.

374
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:24,920
Let's just say the Western world is the most screwed up, and then you would say most of the Eastern world is screwed up.

375
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,960
And here's the thing. I've left most of the African continent, 36 or 38 countries there, out of it.

376
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,780
Because they just seem to be going on along their merry way.

377
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,180
And they pretty much do, right? And also, by the way, that's no song and dance either.

378
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Cannibalism is not as, see, there's a lot of cannibalism everywhere.

379
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,120
By the way, I think I'm going to reiterate.

380
00:28:50,760 --> 00:29:02,160
If you eat pork products, pork on your fork, and it's processed pork, 10% of it, I'd say more, but 10% for sure is human DNA.

381
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,040
So use your noggin. When I say 10% of it is human DNA, what am I saying?

382
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,940
It's people, right? It's people. Rhymer, Soylent Green. What's Soylent Green? It's people.

383
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:20,980
So, yeah, and you want to hear something even weirder is the, if you like those processed pork products,

384
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:30,040
any pork taster, pork sommelier, will tell you, blindfolded, that the one with human meat will always taste better than the one with just pure swine.

385
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,400
So go figure. Yeah.

386
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,720
I was going to actually ask you about that real quick, because some people might just get the muscle.

387
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,600
You know how we were talking about with muscle and organ meat?

388
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,200
Yeah. With beef, you know, muscle and organ product.

389
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,260
OK, well, what about the muscle product of pork that is out there?

390
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,080
Do you think that that also contains?

391
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,180
No, that's mostly mostly the muscle. They would put the human muscle in there.

392
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,400
Yeah. OK, just I'm surprised if they would do skin, but the fat content would change.

393
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,160
This is part of the pranking. This is fun.

394
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,040
This is like, you know, you got a guy flipping burgers in McDonald's and his brother was just arrested.

395
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,600
So here come the pigs. I mean, the cops at the drive through and he spits in their burger.

396
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,440
Right. You heard that, right? Sure.

397
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,560
Of course. Yeah. So it's got that's what they're doing there.

398
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,700
They're just sad at the people, not happy at the people.

399
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,440
And they say, let's grind up some of their babies, which were killing anyway, and put it in there.

400
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,020
And we'll just enjoy knowing that they're eating their own kind, which is a common thing.

401
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,000
Most of the world, by the way, it's just it's openly known in many parts of the world, especially the African continent.

402
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,960
But here it's not here. It's very hush hush.

403
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,120
And it's so hush hush that it's deafening.

404
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,200
So anyway, I left back back to the I left them out.

405
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,520
But basically, it's very easy to fix the Western world because all the ways to fix the Western world,

406
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,180
financially, medically, culturally, religiously, whatever, has already been disclosed.

407
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,160
So this is how bad the cult is.

408
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,660
People are having financial problems.

409
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:10,180
Well, have you gone and studied the codes, statutes, rules, whatever laws that pertain to finance?

410
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,360
No, I don't have time for that. But I have time to worry about it.

411
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:21,200
Right. If you study those codes and you learn how to do restricted endorsements and ask the right questions, you may not be in financial trouble.

412
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm not saying you're going to make money and be wealthy, but you won't be bleeding funny, funny money as money as you are.

413
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,540
Right. With the medical stuff, have you gone and.

414
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,180
Oh, this is OK. Medical. I'm going to bounce around between medical, religious and money here.

415
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,600
And then law a little bit with the medical stuff.

416
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,300
Do you know that no doctor in the U.S. has ever told anyone that they have any disease at all?

417
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,500
Ever. I mean, in the past, let's say 75 years, 50 years for sure.

418
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,520
What the doctors say is that you've been diagnosed with.

419
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,640
Well, we have a lab test showing that you might have.

420
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,760
But the people walk away saying, oh, I have a doctor ever said you had that.

421
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:13,000
He said you were diagnosed or the lab test results came back and it shows that you might have.

422
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:22,580
It's all presumption, but you say you have diabetes, you say you have AIDS, you say you've got whatever, whatever, whatever.

423
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,060
But no medical technician, professional doctor has ever said anyone has ever had anything.

424
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:35,240
You are diagnosed with the symptoms of. Right.

425
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,920
You see how that works? Yes.

426
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:45,200
There is no certified disease ailment, anything that the medical community has put out in decades.

427
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,080
But yet you have all these people crying that I got this, I got that.

428
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,200
I got no. Well, who told you that? No, I didn't. Go look very carefully.

429
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,920
Why are they saying it that way? Because it's all presumption. It's all commerce.

430
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,780
It's all the basic by the basic bodily functions are completely ignored.

431
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,360
Here's the most frustrating thing that I've ever contemplated in my in recent decades.

432
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,820
Why am I the only one discussing the biological vacuum in the human body?

433
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,340
Why seriously? You won't find anything.

434
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,620
But all of the studies, anatomy function scream.

435
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,160
That's the conclusion. Right.

436
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:33,360
So there's something going on where you just have to sit back and say things the way they are and then sit back and see who takes.

437
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,820
And by the way, this is no fault to anyone.

438
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,880
I don't see anyone ever listening to what I'm saying, taking the work and carrying it on on the medical side.

439
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,820
And I'm not talking about just regular subs or whatever. I'm talking about people in the medical community.

440
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,200
Yes, I have told many people in the medical community scores.

441
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,280
How many of them are right forming an alternative movement? None.

442
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
I don't see any. There's something going on, something very wrong.

443
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I will take my time. I will go out of my way and take any amount of time necessary.

444
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:13,320
That's that can be given to speak to someone who's working in the medical field about what you know about the stuff that I talk about and show it and prove it and how it can be addressed.

445
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,960
And I have. And how many of them are doing anything? Nobody, none online or anywhere.

446
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,679
So what the hell is going on now?

447
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,760
Isn't that sound a lot similar to like if you spoke to someone that was deeply ingrained in some kind of cult philosophy?

448
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,800
What? Go ahead and try to talk them out of it. Good luck. It can happen.

449
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,620
Oh, yeah. It doesn't matter. I mean, trying to trying to explain to somebody that, you know, whatever.

450
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,120
Someone who's in a cult, go tell them that what a cult isn't good for them or what they're telling you is the antithesis of what can be shown.

451
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah, it really is. And what are they going to say? Thank you very much. I'll get on it right away or get out of here, man.

452
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,300
All right. When they decide that they have a messiah who is, you know, God, God's power within them.

453
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:05,240
That's the end of it. You know, it's like I can't, you know, you go like, look, OK, so by what proof do you have that this is well, this is what I know.

454
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,220
Well, but how do you know it? Tell me how you know it. And I'll tell you how it's wrong. It doesn't work here.

455
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,580
Let me help you now. They don't want it. They don't want it. It's it's real.

456
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,580
Because they're they're in a cult and severely, severely indoctrinated.

457
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,040
Same same thing with political discussions over the past few years, especially the same with financial.

458
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,900
Same with financial. Henry Ford's, you know, famous quote about if the people found out how the banking system works,

459
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,840
it'd be blood in the streets in 24 hours or something. 72 hours or something like that.

460
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,620
Ain't going to happen. Why? Because they're all, you know, whatever about it. Right.

461
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:49,800
The same with religious stuff. The best thing that's happened to the quote unquote religious people is the Mandela effect changes in the Bible, like it or not.

462
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,900
There are institutions with sculptures and signage and illustrations of the lion laying down with the lamb.

463
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,800
Right. Everyone's heard it. Lion and the lamb ministries. Right. You've heard of that.

464
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,240
But it's not the lion and the lamb never was, according to any Bible. It's the wolf and the lamb.

465
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:14,980
So all these lion and the lamb sculptures and paintings and illustrations should have never happened in the book of Isaiah.

466
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,040
Right. On and on and on. Right. So I love that these things change out of the blue.

467
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:29,580
By the way, I've been directly Mandela affected directly, like actually I engineered something and I needed two of them because they were the same.

468
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:36,200
So I built two. And the next day I went to fit them and one of them was the opposite.

469
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,260
It was it was flipped and I knew I had cut them from the same template.

470
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,460
There is no way I would have cut one this way and one that way because they were cut through and through the same way.

471
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,780
And I was like, oh, my gosh, I ruined my next day. I sit back and meditate on exactly every step that I did.

472
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,220
And I did it. Correct. But something happened where it didn't fit the next day. Right.

473
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:06,580
So that's my own personal thing. You know what I mean? It's kind of it's almost as bad as imagine you you try to go home and the keys don't work.

474
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,640
And like who changed the locks? No one changed the locks. Your keys always work.

475
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,640
No, they don't work. And you get a locksmith says, yeah, it's the wrong key.

476
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,780
But it worked yesterday. Who changed the locks? Nobody did. You see what I mean?

477
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,040
It's that in your face. You know what I mean? I have had that happen.

478
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,720
But oddly, I had not thought about that. And you just reminded me that that happened to me with a key.

479
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,840
It made no sense. She was just tired of you and she changed the locks.

480
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,120
No. Listen, this is a weird situation. I actually wasn't living with anybody else.

481
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,300
This was a weird deal where I was like, I've been here for two years. I've been using this key.

482
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,440
You couldn't have. It's not the right key. And I didn't know it was the right key.

483
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,320
It's not fluid reality. It's I think these things are changing. So we take notice.

484
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,720
Right. Weird stuff. I mean, I was, you know, what are you going to do except, OK, fine, give me the key that works.

485
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,580
But I mean, you know. Yeah. And the whole bit. Here's the interesting thing.

486
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,680
There was someone I've researched this about a year ago about the no crucifixion thing.

487
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,780
By the way, you know, when someone gives a parable or a story and you you resolve the outcome based on how the story is told.

488
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,860
Right. Instead of telling you this directly. Right. That's how the New Testament is about how the Christ was executed.

489
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,580
And it's not a Roman cross. Right. It's by the actions of Pontius Pilate.

490
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:31,440
So. But I did find an article written in the late 90s, and it was by a Greek, by the way, a Greek scholar that talked about the whole world's got it wrong.

491
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,500
It did get press. It did get some press. You'll find the press that there is no crucifixion, according to the Bible.

492
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,740
OK. So where's everybody been for the past 1500 years or so?

493
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,820
You know, let's say you really haven't had access. Most people haven't had access to the Bible for at least 300 years or less.

494
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:55,080
Really? Yeah. Because King James right before that, it was you had no access in the Catholic Church would put you to death.

495
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:05,180
You know, actually, the an excuse for the Catholic Church to attack a town or a village in Europe was when the Protestants came through and handed out Bibles to that whole village or town.

496
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,860
That was an excuse enough for the Catholic Church to send military and kill everyone.

497
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:19,000
By the way, this is let me just say this. This is harsh with the type of morality that's accessible information that's accessible and weaponry that we have.

498
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:32,380
Why is the Vatican still there? If someone set up a big palatial Nazi thing with the SWAT stickers and everything out there, what don't you think that would be bombed by F-16s in like a week?

499
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:44,120
You know, you would have thought so. And the odd question there, the real odd question is they don't actually possess the military that we can see that would repel a serious attack.

500
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:51,460
If somebody really wanted to just, you know, finish that and take it. Why hasn't that happened? That that is a very good question.

501
00:39:51,460 --> 00:40:00,700
They are a thousand times worse than any regime. Well, you know what the actual worst regime ever political regime is, is was FDR. Why?

502
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:11,960
Franklin Delano Roosevelt did what no dictator, no monarch, no parliamentarian, no form of political government in history has ever done in the history of mankind.

503
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:25,600
What was that? The gold confiscation clause. There is no dictator, no matter how good or how bad or system or type of government in the history of man that ever told the people that their gold will be confiscated or there will be a year in prison and $10,000 fine.

504
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:45,420
No, that is absolutely the worst thing that has ever been done, you know, in terms of a policy. Right. And then you could see then, of course, you could say there's the genocidal policies of certain regimes, but those were specifically targeting certain groups.

505
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:59,820
I'm talking about the nation at large. No regime has ever done that. So the hands down in terms of a general order, it's not actually just executive order, but people take it as a general order anyway.

506
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:14,200
They see the Bar Association will construe that executive orders apply to people where they don't only general orders do. And in the US, the last general order was General Order 100 in the 1860s. It was the Lieber code. All the rest have been executive orders.

507
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:44,040
Right. So anyway, are you familiar that there was a letter where Lincoln bequeathed all titles that the United States held any land monies or whatever bequeathed and given and put under the Navy's control? Because if if the union lost, you know, yeah, the Navy would have control over it. And they never that was never changed. Never rescinded. Right. Yeah. So anyway, Lieber code. So there. Yeah. So but anyway, the Bar Association talk about those grasshoppers. I don't even know why they exist, by the way.

508
00:41:44,200 --> 00:42:12,740
I remember someone going into some place and talking to these attorneys about what they're doing is unlawful is about a decade ago. And the first thing they said is, are you trying to say we shouldn't exist? And he kind of shut up and would have taken a lot of balls. But it should have been said, Yeah, no, you should not exist in the capacity that you are. You could exist as some cult off to the side doing what you're doing. Yeah, sure. But not as the mainstay for what people consider to be law. No, you should not exist in that capacity would have been the right thing to have said.

509
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:40,260
So you have all these things working together, because in a cult, that's what that's what happens, right? So yeah, it's these. In other words, if anyone comes and examines the human society, especially in the Western world, nothing should be the way it is. But it just happens to be it's kind of like that. Who's that philosopher that contemporary foster so that everything in the everything in the whole world is wrong, and everybody knows it, right? So and they're letting it go.

510
00:42:40,260 --> 00:43:10,240
I forget. So that's pretty much.

511
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:22,360
No, that's nonsense. That's just people not that was something I thought it was five, two in the front and three in the back. No, because wasn't there wasn't there a Secret Service guy hanging off the back?

512
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:47,740
No, he doesn't. He comes from another car jumped on. I mean, that's okay. I'm not going to go ahead. No, but I've heard that one before. I've heard lots of these. I've heard them all everything from the hyphen and the KitKat to the you know, you name it. Okay. But anyway, weird thing happened to me. And I was wondering because this might be something that touched you. And I was just curious. Okay, just off the top of your head. Don't look at anything or anything. But how would you spell the word antenna?

513
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,300
With a double N, just like it sounds.

514
00:43:52,660 --> 00:44:08,180
Okay. Now what's weird to me is I don't ever recall there being a double in there. And I used to work with antennas. And I used to use antennas. And I would get them from I was one of those guys that went to Radio Shack, right? I was one of those dudes who did that kind of stuff.

515
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,680
All right, hold on. How about biology? Because they antenna are also for insects. Is it also spelled with a single N?

516
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,500
I do not recall.

517
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:16,840
A double N.

518
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,880
That is a that is a that they spell it with an AE sometimes with the insects, right?

519
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,740
Yeah.

520
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,060
Yes.

521
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,560
Are you trying to make it a double N or a single N, right?

522
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,260
Exactly. I recall the AE as in an antenna, like a single one, I think is the way that would be used, right?

523
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,340
Antenna. Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,200
Okay. But antenna, which is also could be a singular. Okay. Or whatever.

525
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,280
It seems weird with one. Are you trying to say that's one N now?

526
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,060
No, I'm saying it is two N's right now. And I recall one N.

527
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, I recall two N's.

528
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,400
Yeah. Okay.

529
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:56,340
That's the problem with with this effect. It's it's based on memory. But I have always harped on people that you've got to improve your memory and everything else will improve.

530
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:05,080
No, certainly. I agree. But it's just and it's look, it's not a major thing. It doesn't shake the world. I'm just saying it's one of those things that absolutely sticks in me the wrong way.

531
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:12,720
It just there was not two N's on there. I know there wasn't. I remember looking at packages. I remember looking at, I mean, seriously, everything.

532
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,780
Really? Okay. Yeah. Because antenna with one N sounds kind of Latin. It would read like a Latin word, but that's fine.

533
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,280
Yes.

534
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,080
You know, like when you speak to someone in Italy, Italia.

535
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah.

536
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,900
They don't say Amazon. They say Amazon.

537
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,440
Amazon. Yeah, right. Exactly.

538
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,680
Because in Italian, the second vowel is emphasized typically.

539
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:34,740
Right.

540
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:40,640
Right. So it doesn't change the spelling. So antenna spell change still sounds like antenna.

541
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:49,100
That's the one thing I do about language is if it sounds right, tomato, tomato, you spell it the same way, potato, potato. And it sounds different.

542
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,420
I think if it sounds the same, the spelling, you know, you've gotten private messages from me.

543
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,540
You know, I'd like to misspell words like time with a Y and public with a K.

544
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:58,900
Right.

545
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,660
Oh, yeah. Sure.

546
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:07,120
Yeah. I like to do that just to show that how well, you know, the language is not a factor of what's being written. It's how it sounds.

547
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,300
No, look, and I'm all for that. And I get that it sounds proper. I'm not trying to make a big issue out of it.

548
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,980
I'm just saying.

549
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:22,420
No, no, no. But that is all effect is about these little innocuous, harmless changes to get to get us to those who are ready to to pay attention to start paying attention.

550
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,400
Right. So something is weird here, because I'm telling you now, most of this stuff I have.

551
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,960
You could bring up a hundred of these things and I'll go, look, man, come on.

552
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,740
I understand even why people are misremembering.

553
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,240
OK, in cases like with the JFK thing, I get it.

554
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,320
They're they're turning around and forgetting that, you know, John Connolly was wounded.

555
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,940
It's OK, because hardly anybody talks about Connolly getting wounded.

556
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,960
But he was. Yeah, right. So you just you know, he was the governor of Louisiana or something like that.

557
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,360
The governor of Texas, the governor of Texas, governor of Texas.

558
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,180
And his wife is sitting next to him. So there's two people.

559
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,680
And then you got John and his wife. That's two more people.

560
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,380
And then you got two Secret Service agents in the front. That's six.

561
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,440
That's the way it's always been the way I know it. Now, people.

562
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,500
This is a pruder show that. Yes, yes, absolutely.

563
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,980
And it always. And but that's the thing is I studied this long time and I don't remember any change.

564
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,860
You know what I'm saying? But this was weird to me because I'm telling you, I remember looking at boxes with the big word antenna,

565
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:24,160
the small word antenna. I remember buying antennas. I remember vaguely, vaguely, vaguely.

566
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,240
I could see one. And, you know, and I think here's the thing.

567
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,240
It's not static. There's a lot that's going to change and keep changing.

568
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,080
Some things might change back. Maybe so. And maybe this has nothing to do with anything.

569
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,380
And it's just me being weird. But I'm just saying it's just weird.

570
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,400
Well, I don't know. Weird. Maybe other things, but not weird.

571
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,440
I might be odd a little bit. But the thing is, it's just weird thing like that to me.

572
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,600
It's just kind of like for some reason, this sticks out to me.

573
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,880
And I don't know why I'm going, you know, doesn't even make sense as to why this is a big deal.

574
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,540
But I tweeted about it. I was like, does anybody else remember this?

575
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,820
And nobody said anything. That's fine. But look, let's just go back to the cult real quick.

576
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:07,440
It'll wrap this up. Please do. When when you're looking for a cult to disband or change or improve or whatever.

577
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,200
So it's not a cult. It's not going to happen by its followers.

578
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,500
Is what it was. What was the thought that I wanted to really instill?

579
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,580
No, it never does. Well, it never does. If you look at any cult that is ever disbanded, broken in any way, shape or form.

580
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,520
How does it happen? How about the top down? Yeah, top down.

581
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,300
There you go. So that's the only way this will happen then. Right.

582
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,560
Yep. From the top down. Yep.
