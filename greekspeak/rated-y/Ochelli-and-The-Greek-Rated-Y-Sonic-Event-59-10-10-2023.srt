1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,640
Tape is running Sonic Event 59, Uccelli in the Greek rated Y.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,900
So we'll just continue where we were last we spoke, I suppose.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,560
But before we get there, real quick, I do have one little thing I want to throw in.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,160
You know, I'm thinking a lot more about cosmic censorship in the past couple of days,

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,260
wondering if it is cosmic or if it is self-imposed, the very oversimplified viewpoints

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,760
that I see people deciding to line up with, with their virtue signaling,

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,440
etc, etc. I'm wondering about that. And I wanted to start off with that question, if you don't mind.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,880
Well, you need I need more information because it's you kind of forwarded it in a way that

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't really deliver it, meaning like, like, it's only applicable when you want it to be.

10
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,160
I mean, you know, it sounded like it's optional. And I'm saying,

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,880
the way you presented it, what I'm saying, it's not optional.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,980
Well, there you go. That's what I'm trying to direct you until you directly address it. And

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,640
then there's the ritual, the spiritual algorithm of once you acknowledge something

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,440
and speak it to someone else, it starts to be examined. And then upon examination,

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,760
it can be measured, quantified, qualified and adjusted. And that happens with everything.

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,740
OK, well, what I see is relating to what we discussed last time, which was the incident

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,400
in Israel. What is going on? And it does seem to be escalating a bit, but I don't know if this is

18
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,620
I'll get into that. Yeah. You know, but but the virtue signaling that I see here,

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,900
you see automatically there are people attaching themselves to the cause one way or another.

20
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,880
Yeah. But hold on. Let me let me just get into it real quick. Yeah. I don't watch CNN or Fox

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,140
News or even click on their stuff on YouTube or anything like that. I don't I don't watch

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,420
television or cable or anything. Occasionally we I have a Roku, which is a stream device.

23
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,740
And I put on YouTube's when we're eating dinner just to travel the world and see what's going on.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,180
You have a lot of control with YouTube. Right. You know, and you could put a fireplace on.

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,740
Right. And it's a nice it's a really high definition, 44 inch flat screen off to the

26
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,500
side. And it's entertainment. You know, the wife and I have been together 21 years now.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,080
So having a TV on in that capacity is not having the TV on. It's just, you know,

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,940
video. Right. Of whatever we want. So other than that, if the subject is brought up the way it has

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,580
been or of certain things that pop up, I don't know what's going on. I don't watch anything at

30
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,180
all. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So meaning I don't know how they're pushing it in

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,740
the mainstream. Believe it or not, I didn't even know how they were pushing the covid

32
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,600
in the mainstream. I didn't watch any of it. But I don't care about how they're pushing

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,100
it in the mainstream. What I'm saying is that people jumped even before they really got rolling

34
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,880
on the mainstream. People instantaneously jumped and went to their social media and went to make

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,920
statements and sent messages to me directly to other people directly about it. You know, as soon

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,620
as they got the first reports, there was like an almost reflexive action to join one way or another.

37
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,840
And I see it as you know, there are there are some people that

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,980
reactionary you don't want to be reactionary. Right. Right. Yeah. Even if they were ready to

39
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,820
nuke your town, you don't want to be reactionary. You say it's going to get real hot and pop in here

40
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:44,660
in a minute. So let's go over here. Yeah. Yeah. Or just get on the roof and take it all. Yeah.

41
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,260
Don't be reactionary. No, I responded to people. Look, even if you know, even if you are worried

42
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,340
about, you know, the world's going to end now because of this, I say, well, you know,

43
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,200
what doesn't work that way? Well, it doesn't work that way. But, you know, don't believe me about

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,080
that. OK, well, you know who had the right to say the world was ending was a lot of the

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,620
cities and towns in Japan and Europe during World War Two and they were being firebombed.

46
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,420
Yeah, right. That that would definitely look like the world was ending and you would have a lot of

47
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,720
right to say so. Well, if you were there. Yeah. And in retrospect, we haven't gotten a lot of

48
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,079
reports that people were saying it was the end of the world that actually they did. I know

49
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,100
several people from the 80s that were boots on the ground and in London and in Hungary,

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,940
where they were dropping rockets and bombs and they broke out the zoo. So the people came out

51
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,620
of the shelter in the morning and their elephants and lions in the street. Right. In Budapest,

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,260
stuff like that. Fire bombings. Yeah. Yeah. So they could say it's the end of the world and

53
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,760
in retrospect, we don't get a lot of them. No, it's not the end of the world. The world is man's

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,580
society. The earth is basically what it is. You still can't figure out what shape it is overall.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,680
And you can't, by the way. I think I've gone over that. Yes. Yeah. But this is what I'm looking at

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,300
here. This is the first thing that jumped out at me at a quick Occam's razor. This is not a

57
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,680
Freemasonic signaling. You mentioned signaling. I don't see any five ones or one fives or fives or

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,640
thirty threes popping up. Right. Or 17s. Those are Masonic numbers. Nineteens. I don't see any

59
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:26,740
of that at all. No, three threes. No. OK, so that's because, by the way, you saw a lot of that with the

60
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,920
the coronavirus because of the medical industry is basically very much steep in Masonic.

61
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,620
If you look at the the V-neck that the doctors wear, it's you know, you have different colors

62
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,900
for different levels. Right. Right. That's the 90 degree. That's the Masonic. The same as

63
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,700
graduation and all that. That's very, very, very Masonic. You can see it in their symbol,

64
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,420
the the what do they call it, the square, which is laid down on the over the over the video.

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,580
The same they do with the universities. That's why a lot of hospitals are also university medical

66
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,980
centers, so to speak. So all that stuff is tied in. None of that. I don't see any Masonic signaling

67
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:18,980
to themselves at all. Basically, this is a purely intelligence operation. What makes it that is when

68
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,960
you see the word terrorist being used that instantaneously. And also when they start

69
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,260
saying, oh, again, a failure of intelligence, all of those signals. That's exactly what it is.

70
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,300
And that's the funny part, because to me, OK, look, it's not organic. This is not an organic

71
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,820
occurrence in my mind. This is orchestrated. There was a lot of tells before it happened.

72
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,360
So, yeah. Also, I have a friend who went to Israel. He's from Israel. He spent a month there

73
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,520
and he basically came back saying, thanks for your procrastination. All the stuff you've been

74
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,260
talking about is happening right now. And this was two months ago. Right. So. Right. Well, and

75
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,020
that's the thing I was asking you about a couple of months ago where I said, look, you know,

76
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,900
there's things that they're reporting on. And you said, look, forget about what they're reporting on,

77
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,480
because that's always wrong. But something is happening because.

78
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:18,140
Hold on. This is being proper. It's being shown more than what it is. Now, unless you start seeing

79
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,960
tens of thousands of people, like, for example, they talk about the nuclear atomic bombs on Japan

80
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,080
that didn't kill one third or one quarter or maybe conservatively a fifth of the people that died

81
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,260
during the fire bombings of Tokyo, right, which was over a quarter of a million, supposedly,

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,180
if we go by their numbers, or even Dresden, or, you know, those firebombing talks about those were

83
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,200
savage, savage bombing. So yeah, quarter of a million, almost three quarters of a million in

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Japan died from American bombings, which is nothing compared to the atomic bombs to get

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,240
all the play. Okay, so what does that mean with this? Yeah, the they're doing the body count thing

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,100
they're showing stock footage, by the way, old stock footage. Some of the stock footage is so

87
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,460
bad. It's from the 80s, by the way. Oh, I know. So that stuff I proved recently, by the way. I

88
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,260
mean, you got people in the wrong uniforms, you got technology that's all over in use in the films.

89
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,780
I mean, everything. It's a horrible. It's not even a good attempt to do it. Right. I mean,

90
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,180
really, no, they don't have to because the people are so whatever, at this point, but

91
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,080
they've always been that way. But But here's the thing. What makes this the intelligence op is this.

92
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,880
The Freemasonic signaling is not there. Now people talk about the elite, the intelligence, okay.

93
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,200
World War One, on the surface was to get rid of the monarchies and bring in these fake republics

94
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,000
and all that, right. Okay, so there's an international consent League of Nations,

95
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,060
supposedly, which didn't work. There are international bodies before the League of

96
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,660
Nations that's still around, by the way, you could look them up is one or two. Anyway,

97
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,480
um, what it did was it put the intelligence, it knocked out all of those smaller intelligence

98
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,780
agencies, and of all the nations, and it's set up for a grand worldwide intelligence agency,

99
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:10,240
one of which was actually propagated during World War Two. And World War Two was they had to show

100
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,720
that the Americans won, which they didn't at all, because they were going to use the Americans as

101
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,400
the police force as the central military force, right for the world. Right. And that's all these

102
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,680
two wars really did. And there's a lot more finer details, you know, but that's generally it. So

103
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,520
basically, when we people talk about the elite, the banking leader, they're not running the show,

104
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,760
it's the intelligence agencies are because I've given what I've borne us a very strong witness

105
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,660
to someone whose job it was to call up people like Jeff bozos. After they checked their bank

106
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,140
account, their bank account went to zero to reconsider what they were saying in public,

107
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:58,000
right? Prince tried to break away. Right? And, you know, the former well known as Prince,

108
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,660
right, the musician, right. And they're like, Wait a second, what do you think you're doing buying

109
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,640
all this travel gear and an island? No, we're gonna make a bank count zero, you got to come

110
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,080
back and do a show and be normal. Like you like you're supposed to be right meaning as as a normal

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,260
Prince and he did. So who does that? It's the intelligence agencies that control all the

112
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,780
banking, right, not the Rothschilds in the right. So they control the government, right? The you

113
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,680
know, the presidents are transients, the prime ministers are transients, right? So these

114
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,340
intelligence agencies are not getting the play. When they say CIA or all the or Masada, whatever,

115
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:44,280
that's like a very surface. It doesn't really convey what's going on, right? People, you know,

116
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,920
like I know people who worked for those agencies. That's a bureaucratic end of it. Really?

117
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,100
It's Yeah, that's not it. Yeah, that's like the foot soldiers. They're so you know, low on the

118
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,560
totem pole, still basically a little closer away from the surface and a little closer to the

119
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,040
reality is something like the five eyes concept where you have right, the international group

120
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,160
together working together. And yeah, some of us on the books, but they all here, let me give you an

121
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,940
example. When they say their enemies, their friends, like, you know, the supernotes, for

122
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,500
example, the notes in the United States are printed in North Korea. Yeah, bio weapons are used and

123
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:30,420
tested there by by administrations for the Americans. Iran and Israel are enemies. I doubt

124
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,740
it. Anyone that knows the underworld in Japan will tell you it's the Yakuza were knocked out

125
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,320
of the powers been taken away, kind of like the New York mob was right. And who's in power of

126
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,960
the underworld there. It's the Israeli underworld and the Iranian Persian underworld. They're like

127
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,280
hand and glove. They work together very, very, very close. So Iran and Israel in the underworld,

128
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:00,000
which is the under under unregulated, unseen, but well known, are very, very, very close.

129
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,020
As a matter of fact, you can plot things that are going to happen back and forth

130
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,920
and see how very closely Israel and Iran work together. There are the two powers. As a matter

131
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,000
of fact, there is a very people don't know you could I don't know how much you could look this

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,980
up. But the oldest, quote unquote, Jewish money in the world is in Iran. They basically as a

133
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,540
failsafe, if Israel were to be wiped out, the quote unquote Jewish site or the Zionist world

134
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,460
will be run out of Iran. Well, here's a funny here's a little fun fact that I just happen to

135
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,840
know, and I'm not going to explain how I know it, but they communicate through a language,

136
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:48,360
which is a combination of Arabic and what it is they allegedly speak in Israel. It's not

137
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,380
a pure language like you see written out anywhere else, by the way.

138
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,380
There's this combined language that they use, which throw everything by the by that person

139
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,140
wouldn't that would be Farsi. Yeah, not Arabic. Yeah. So it would be like the same language

140
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,500
spoken in Afghanistan. There is a big contention between Arabs and Israelis. Yes, but not the

141
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,860
Persians at all. What? Yeah, funny thing that they speak Farsi in Afghanistan, because that's,

142
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,580
you know, still a plenty good source of, you know, heroin. So, you know, you got to be able

143
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,280
to communicate with your farmers if you're going to get directly from the source, don't you?

144
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,500
So sure, but that's all screwed up the the opium trade because it was given to the Americans by

145
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,900
the British so they would not invade Canada. Yeah, but then they stuck it over, but they stuck

146
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,040
a whole bunch of it over in what I call Oceania over down by Australia now and nobody pays attention,

147
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,160
by the way. So yeah, sure, sure. But the black market is the underworld. And all right, who's

148
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,220
okay, just a little tangent, the most notorious countries for the black market, there's three of

149
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,860
them. And if you live in the US, it's that one of the number one would be that very dangerous

150
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,440
country to the north of the US, which is known as Canada. The second one would be South Africa.

151
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,720
And the third one is Brazil. So what do these three have in common? If you need black market

152
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,400
nukes? Guess who purveys them? You're going to get it through a Canadian, a Brazilian,

153
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:26,600
or South Africa. That's where they're purveyed through the 21 p seven granite 700 granite

154
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,740
missiles that went missing on the Kursk submarine that was one was fired into the Pentagon on 911

155
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,880
is handled by one of those three countries, middlemen, or, you know, or based out of

156
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,640
operations. Canada is extremely dirty. That's why you never hear about them. You hear North Korea,

157
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,800
Iran, Somalia, you know, whatever. So Brazil is also not listed, but it is a nuclear power,

158
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,800
more atomic power, right? They have atomic weapons. And of course, everyone knows that all

159
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,480
the trigger mechanisms and all the stuff is goes through South Africa. By the way, when someone

160
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,140
sells you a nuclear weapon, it never comes with the trigger. You get the body, you get all that.

161
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,780
But when you want to use that want to use it, they ask you for the US for the trigger and say,

162
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,280
well, where do you want to use it? Then if it's approved, they give you the trigger mechanism,

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,720
it would be like the key to a car, you know, or the starter, you know, about starters,

164
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,400
they took the starter out of your car, right, or something. So all these things are very logically

165
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,100
induced, if you watch what's going on. By the way, also, when you hear about the US giving weapons

166
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,520
to other countries, weapons aid, they can't use any of the weapons, unless they get approval.

167
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,680
Right. So let's say the US gives weapons to France, or let's say they're very industrial.

168
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,700
Well, let's say some country in that country now has the weapons and they want to use them,

169
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,740
they cannot use them unless they get permission. So when you hear about some country got foreign

170
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,880
aid, and they use it against another country, well, they had to get the permission from who

171
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,680
they got the weapons from to do it. And this is an ongoing thing. It's it's comes with conditions,

172
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,740
right? So these things, these, everything that I'm telling you is not hard to find out,

173
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,140
I don't know how hard it would be on the internet. But if you're active in researching and,

174
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,320
and know people in various aspects of life, and you accumulate, you know, four decades of,

175
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,960
you have a good memory, put it all together, right? So that's where I'm, that's why I'm saying

176
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,180
what I'm saying. And you can take it to the bank. And what you could really take to the bank is,

177
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:37,160
if you see Iran being drawn into this, it's definitely, you know, an inside, you know,

178
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,100
kind of deal, very, very heavy deal between Israel sacrificing a whole bunch of people,

179
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,900
and on and on and on. Because if Iran is dragged into this is going to be a big dispersal of,

180
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,300
you know, dynamics, right, throughout the whole world. I don't think if you really want to know

181
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,240
what's going on, see how this affects the underworld, the black markets, it's it will,

182
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:12,000
what is going to affect is the open markets, you know, like I did some articles, I posted on Skype

183
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,359
to some people, one of them, I'll bring them up real quick, is how several alternative papers

184
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,339
are questioning how could it be an intelligence failure? It's not possible, right? Because they

185
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,540
have a very strong intelligence network, right? The other thing I brought up is 30 billion shekels

186
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:40,220
were put on the market because the shekels fell. Right? Now, in international law,

187
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:49,440
when a country loses a campaign, it's it's currency is usually devalued, or goes to zero,

188
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,900
like the Iraq war. Remember, they got right after the Iraq was taken over by the coalition,

189
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,200
and whether the DNR Iraqi DNR went to zero, and they created a new DNR, right? All that hype

190
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,840
behind that. Okay. Yeah. So if they're preempting telling you that the Israeli currency is failing,

191
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,960
that's like signaling to people who know what I just said that Israel is going to capitulate or

192
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,760
be the loser in this. By the way, I did mention this a while back, right? Unlike other campaigns,

193
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,520
which they've had, you know, from the Six Day War, the wars that they had in the 60s, 70s,

194
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,140
and the early 2000s, they did have a little skirmish with the North. You know, it lasted

195
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,820
about two weeks. And they said, we're at war. I think it was with Lebanon. Remember, in the early

196
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,000
2000s, 2003 2004, something like that was a short one week, something like that. And yeah, yeah. So

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,280
this one, they're going to compete, they're going to lose pretty much not lose, but take a negative

198
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,380
stance on the outcome. How's that? Okay. And they're signaling that by telling you that they're,

199
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,140
they're doing it backwards. They're telling you the end at the beginning. Right? Which is, you

200
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,880
know, the currency going down. So that's interesting. But other than that, it's the typical

201
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,420
media shit show circus. You know, how many people in body bags and the body counts and all that.

202
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,040
What's funny, I haven't even seen Masonic numbers in the body counts.

203
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,400
They're odd numbers. Yeah. So the Masons are out of this. I think there's a little bit of a power

204
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,280
struggle here, because the Masons are everywhere. He's a bar association, right? Mason's doctors,

205
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,600
all those upper level professionals of the banking, they're all Masonic, they use Masonic

206
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,360
signaling, but I don't see Masonic signaling here. So when you said it's not organic, it's beyond

207
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,840
being non organic. It's, it's something new, which I've talked about also, you're going to see things

208
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,520
that are you haven't seen before. So with that said, it's really hard to get an objective point

209
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,400
of view of what's going on other than boots on the ground, which I do have, by the way,

210
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,120
and I have not had any contact with them, because I see what's going on. I think boots on the ground

211
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:09,960
matter the most when it before any event happens, right. And then during if the what they're showing

212
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,200
you seems to be majorly contradicting, but I've read a lot of fake photographs, which actually,

213
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,720
if you look closely at that photograph, you could find it it's stock footage. Some of the

214
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,980
current wreckage, you know, like, you know, 1000s of buildings being hit with missiles,

215
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,660
you know, on both on Gaza and all that, those seem to be fairly current. But otherwise,

216
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:40,900
yeah, this is what happens, by the way, when you, as a human, stop developing at nine years old,

217
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,260
and you spend the rest of your life basically as an idiot. And, like, someone left a message,

218
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,580
should we buy silver and gold and said, Why? And so the dollar loses its value, whatever I said,

219
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,940
dollar doesn't have any value at all. The only value it has is the people accepted as tender for

220
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,720
things that you think have value to think the money currency that you're using has value is

221
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,180
foolish. Anyone in banking higher up will tell you that it's based on faith. Right? So what kind of

222
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,900
people would have faith in a system like this? There's no help for them? What kind of people

223
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,320
would have faith in a medical system that tells you what they do, which is everything? What kind

224
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,240
of people would have? Right? Look at the religion, look at everything they do. I mean, it's like,

225
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,940
oh, my gosh. So when these things happen, are they bad things? Or are they just an outcome of just a

226
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,240
really bad society? Right? You know, a lot of people say, Well, you speak against the Vatican,

227
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,320
so Catholics bad. And I'll say, No, they're not bad. But I'll tell you for sure. They're not good.

228
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,480
Right? So you can be not bad and definitely not be good. They're very, very little good is being

229
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,260
done by going along with it. There's an ancient well, there's a maxim that if you go along with

230
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,940
something, you're complicit with it, you bear some of the guilt also, right? So here's the other

231
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,860
part about the intelligence operation, you'll never hear anywhere else. These people, Hamas,

232
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,760
which is the resistance movement, right, that was put in place, of course, intelligence operation.

233
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,020
When they got into make things better for the quote, unquote, Palestinians, they say that

234
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:27,920
we have to get away from this corrupt judicial system with the bar attorneys, do we have to get

235
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:34,360
away from this fiat money? Did they say anything about the Pope's work schedule Hamas? Right? Did

236
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,100
they say anything about this bullshit medical stuff they're getting? No, no, that's how you know,

237
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,600
it's a that's how you know, it's an intelligence operation. And then someone will might come up

238
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,520
and say, Well, Greek, they're all no one talks about that. I'll say, Well, thank you. They're

239
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:55,000
all intelligence operations, you see. So, so this is their own fighting. So if you participate,

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,900
and in that, and here's the thing, things go south. Like, for example, here's a small

241
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,420
analogy, Portland, I think is one of these cities that during, you know, they did all that racial

242
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:16,540
stuff. And then they did the LGBTQ didn't they like close off some streets and like, like San Francisco,

243
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,020
the crime rates gone up high, a lot of businesses are closed, right? All this stuff, right?

244
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,400
You hear all that stuff. And actually, people have gone there. It's going down, right? Chicago

245
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,380
for the longest time, right? Right, right. Lizzie, whatever running it. Okay, all this is by design.

246
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:40,620
So when you start seeing stuff, this really shit quality, ethic and morality that you have in

247
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,600
society prevalent everywhere, pretty much. When you see it affecting your physicality,

248
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,520
it doesn't happen all of a sudden. When you see it affecting your physicality, your food,

249
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,220
clothing, shelter, quality, you have plenty of time to move, right? Your point or, you know,

250
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,480
or buck up and take it, right? In other words, it shouldn't be a surprise. So,

251
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,060
so when San Francisco going down in Portland, Oregon going down in other places like Chicago,

252
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,200
it was a slow, it might be two, three years, but that's plenty of time to make a decision where,

253
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,520
you know, I got to leave here because it's getting really bad, right? Okay, so the same

254
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,280
thing has been going on in in Palestine for a long time, but people put up with it. The problem

255
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,120
that they have is they're putting up with the leadership that's put over them, right? So here's

256
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,140
my here's what I always end up saying. Even if you live in a dictatorship, the worst dictatorship

257
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,400
you could imagine, it still demands a certain amount of population, the people in the populace

258
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,380
to participate in the activities in government, right? So, you know, especially in the American

259
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:54,340
government, it's shameful, how little participation there is. And with that participation,

260
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,760
you can actually create a voice and, you know, find out really what's going on. So

261
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,760
by trying to create a voice, you know, and then reporting back, what do I mean by this? Let's say

262
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,000
you want to any society participate in the affairs of the government, be public about it. So when

263
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,160
they shut you down or infiltrate you or call you a terrorist or whatever, you have a record that

264
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,540
you're, and you could show that it's an artificial state of leadership, right? Just like what I

265
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,640
mentioned, like Hamas, did they tell the Palestinian people they're being enslaved by a fiat system and

266
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,260
a poor medical system and a poor judicial? None of that. So they're part of that, right?

267
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:46,000
Right. Yeah. So this is there. But it doesn't really matter where you are. But in this case,

268
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,320
things happen very quickly. Right? Well, sort of, I'm sure that, look, I've been telling people,

269
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,880
even with you, Chuck, on the Sonics, how many times have you heard me say if you live near

270
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,060
Gaza or a Palestinian, especially the West Bank, you should consider moving as we go more and more

271
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:11,080
into the future. You've heard me say this many times. Sure. Especially the West Bank up north

272
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,860
there. That's that will be completely gone. I don't know about this time around. Right. And

273
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,180
I've also talked about the repeat of judges. You know, it's the 14th prime minister that's going to

274
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,740
do it. And that's all muddy muddled up with Netanyahu being in again, but not really. It's

275
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:36,540
still around 1213 on the count. So, yeah, what I would beckon to anyone to pay attention that

276
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,200
there's going to be a governmental change in Israel. In other words, this the current system

277
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,380
with all the all the houses of labor and parliamentary style and prime minister style,

278
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,340
they do have a president, by the way, any country that has a credit system, which is all have a

279
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:01,080
president. You may not see them as the forward political whatever states person, but they have

280
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,920
to have a president, someone to sign off right on the bonds and the bills. So the current system

281
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,980
they have in Israel is going to change. I would venture to say they're going to revive some form

282
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,960
of monarchy. Right. So this might be the impetus for that, not the other things that I've said,

283
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:28,400
but the impetus for that also, I said, was someone that would do something on the Israeli side that

284
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,720
would be like Samson. Right. Against the Palestinians that would have the upper hand.

285
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,720
So this may not be the one that I've always been talking about that will change the face of the

286
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,380
Middle East, but it sure does look like it's stirring up the pot enough that it would lead to

287
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:50,700
it. Right. So I'm looking at it from a perspective of the news that was written thousands of years

288
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,280
ago, not the news that's been written last year or this week. Right. Right. Well, I guess that's

289
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:05,980
you know, and then that still stands as far as I know, you know, the what's that stands the

290
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,600
prediction, you know, the way this is supposed to go. Yeah, well, it's complex. But the simple

291
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,620
thing is this. As long as Israel has prime ministers, they will never be considered to be

292
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,160
righteous on the world scene. So when they end that government and they bring in a new form of

293
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,160
government, then there'll be a new view on the state, quote unquote, state of Israel. Right.

294
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,480
The other thing that's going to happen is a massive around the 14th prime minister,

295
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,660
massive conflict between the Palestinians, modern day Philistines and Israel, which will lead to

296
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,720
heavy losses on both sides, which would be the impetus of the change of that government, most

297
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:48,000
likely. But either way, whether one happens after the other, the how this will end up is that the

298
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,440
Palestinians and the Israelis were going to be allies. I know it sounds crazy. Israel will give

299
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,080
a lot of land, even their capital. Really? Yeah, it sounds entirely crazy, because I mean, the way

300
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,000
it appears at the moment is almost like they're going to try and wipe them off of the planet

301
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,540
what's left of them. And they don't have a lot of territory at the moment for sure. Well,

302
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,480
that was also said by the Arabs in the 60s. Remember, I said Israel, we're going to wipe

303
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,400
it off. That was the slogan back in the 60s. They were going to push them into the ocean,

304
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,380
I think was the. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. Right. Obliteration. Either way. Yeah. Same kind.

305
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,860
That's the opposite. Yeah. What I what I see is things are not as they appear today. Like,

306
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,060
in other words, when you look at these news stories that run for a few days or a few

307
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,600
weeks, even though it's never as it appears in the long run. So I'm giving a longer forecast. But

308
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,400
my advice to anyone who does live there is to move, especially if you're on the if you're

309
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,780
Palestinian, you know, in those areas, right? Certainly. Yeah. But if you're Palestinian,

310
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,040
and let's say Central Israel, you'll probably be fine. And that doesn't mean for this campaign.

311
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,880
Right. So there was a someone I spoke to in California a while back. She's a jeweler,

312
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,220
Palestinian in Beverly Hills, well off. And she has family in in the West Bank,

313
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,280
I think, and she gave them the advice and they took it from from the report that I got.

314
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:19,300
Very smart. But yeah, this was many years ago. So many years ago, about a decade. Right. So

315
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:26,900
fair enough. Yeah. So that's pretty much it. I wouldn't say watch all these events. If you

316
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,200
watch the news, you know, people say watch the news closely, we'll watch it closely.

317
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,480
There's nothing to watch closely. Right? It's all garbage, the way it's presented, right? It's like,

318
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,120
go to McDonald's by 20 Big Macs and eat them all in one sitting. That's right. That's gonna get

319
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,160
sick if you do that. Exactly. That's the thing I was trying to, you know, get at earlier with

320
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,580
somebody else is that like, look, don't don't keep staring at this because it's, you know,

321
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,740
basically, it's trauma porn. You know, people used to call it rubbernecking when we were younger.

322
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,260
And what was that? Rubbernecking was it meant that basically traffic was going to slow down

323
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,200
because people are going to stop to look at the carnage from the accident. And that's all it is.

324
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,460
It's that except it's on a massive scale. You're not slowing down traffic. Now what you are doing

325
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,280
is slowing down progress because you're just sticking yourself to this continuous reruns of

326
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,820
how horrible this is, how terrible this is. Well, it's shocking. It's shocking because

327
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,140
being traumatized by concussive forces, high speed chemistry, in other words,

328
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:34,120
bombs. Yeah, it's very shocking. But of course, I assure you that no matter how many people die

329
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,900
on either side, any country in the world, except for I'm going to qualify here,

330
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,460
you will never have as many people in recent history dying as many as the medical community

331
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,820
kills. And the only difference with the medical community is when they kill your loved one,

332
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,140
whatever the surviving family thanks the doctors for everything they did.

333
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,700
Right. That's the main difference, right? Well, I think the other main difference is that they've

334
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,560
actually killed more people than all the wars combined, actually. Yeah, exactly. In a short

335
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,780
amount of time. Yeah. So no matter if you if you're just concerned, some people say, well,

336
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,280
people are dying. Well, if it's just about people dying, you should go after the medical people

337
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,120
then because they've killed more than, like you said, all wars combined. So why if it's just about

338
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,180
killing people, right? If it's just about the killing? Yeah, go after the doc. You know,

339
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,320
they're not even doctors because the doctor doesn't even mean what they're their medical

340
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,740
technicians. And they're doing, you know, the bidding of, you know, calling the population.

341
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,360
Again, if a million Americans died in this war, it wouldn't be it would be nothing a drop in the

342
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,240
bucket compared to how many Americans have died under medical care. Right? Absolutely. So again,

343
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,040
no matter how you in every country, except for places that don't have these systems,

344
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,800
and they're doing just fine. So that's that don't never want to hear about people dying.

345
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,600
You know, if you start have a movement coming around says it's bad that people are being

346
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,620
killed by the medical institutions. Well, then, yeah, then I'll back you up. I'll say, yeah,

347
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,940
definitely. Let's let's talk about that more. And let's form something together.

348
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,320
But if you start telling me that how many people were killed in this conflict, that is absolutely

349
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,860
minuscule compared, right? So it's not about people dying.

350
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,920
So the medical slaughterhouse is more efficient than the military industrial complex any day.

351
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,320
Absolutely. And if you talk about human trafficking, and all that other stuff,

352
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,880
it's the legal association, the legal groups that do more human trafficking than anything

353
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,380
that anyone has ever done, then any organized crime group or anything else that they tell you,

354
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,060
whether it's prisons and fines and all that. Yeah. So So tell by human trafficking, what a

355
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,020
crock of crap, you know, there's a over six or 7 million people being trafficked in America right

356
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,720
now openly by the Bar Association. You know, there's no I must say this, I've said, I assure

357
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:56,180
you, there is no one in prison that is there lawfully or even legally, no one at all, at all.

358
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,100
Now, if some people might say, well, this person's a murderer, you think you should be? No, I didn't

359
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,100
say this should be whatever, out in the street. I'm just saying that no one in any prison in

360
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,780
America is there lawfully or even legally, because in order to be in there illegally,

361
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,139
there's certain procedures that have to be fulfilled. And none of those are anymore at all.

362
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,280
So yeah, that's how bad it is. So what is it? It's human trafficking, you know,

363
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,040
it goes through the Federal Reserve, bonding, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So

364
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,719
I don't want to hear about human trafficking either, unless you bring up, you know,

365
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,280
the Bar Association. So this is the reality that people, you know, will never figure out

366
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,440
in this particular ever that they have.
