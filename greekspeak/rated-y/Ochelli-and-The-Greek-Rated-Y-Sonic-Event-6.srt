1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:13,260
Sonic event number six here on Ocelli in the Greek rated Y. I'm obviously Ocelli

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,240
because that's the raspy voice that you're used to if you subscribed here.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,020
And sorry for the delay recently, just going to address that, but we did have a

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:31,400
minor delay, uh, all my doing and it is all changed and fixed up and good to go now.

5
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,860
So anyway, we'll put that out of the way and talk about some of the stuff in the

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,860
chat room, which is available.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,880
If you're not aware toward the bottom of the landing page, if you're a member and

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,220
also, uh, give me some feedback about the way it's set up now, hopefully it is easy

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,820
to navigate.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,300
And if there is any suggestions, I'll be more than happy to take them because I'm

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,280
handling all that and try not to bother the Greek with it because he's got other

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,780
stuff to do like Greek speak and, uh, addressing directly.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,720
Some of the stuff in the chat room is going to be interesting today because they're,

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,120
they're some of the most often brought up, um, points of query questions, points of

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,580
interest.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,240
I would say every time somebody hears Greek speak Greek, um, anyway, how are you doing

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
today, by the way?

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,360
Oh, well, we're doing it right.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,000
Number six.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,520
And, uh, the delay was a sort of a delay, but not too bad.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:26,900
Hopefully.

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,120
Uh, yeah.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,480
Chat room, by the way, let everybody know that the chat is not, uh, inclusive with the

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,160
subs or the subscription.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,500
Anyone can access it.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,180
So if you're a sub and you see the chat room, you can send a link to someone else as

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,840
well.

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,440
Oh, isn't that, isn't that how it works?

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,420
Yeah, that is how it works.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,080
But the thing is, uh, it's not something that's advertised anywhere.

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,320
So yeah, you'd have to actually share the direct link to go to just the chat room, uh,

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,480
which is available on chat tango alone, but they won't get the content without

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,120
subscribing.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Cause you gotta be able to enter that page, but sure.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,240
But they'll get it.

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,500
They'll get a feeling of what it's like to be, uh, getting the Sonics as well somewhat.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,760
Uh, but, but it is open.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,240
It's, it's not, say it's not just inclusive it's or exclusive it's open.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,760
So just wanted to put that out.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,020
So if someone runs into it in the public and they're not a part of the Sonics, that's

41
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,300
fine.

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,060
And they can go in there anonymously as well.

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,960
You don't have to sign in.

44
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,900
I know a lot of people don't like to sign in and all that.

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,060
You don't have to, you can go in there anonymously.

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,300
Uh, and there are people who have, uh, participated anonymously.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm sure you've seen that.

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:36,560
Right.

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah.

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,180
And it is moderated to some degree and, uh, you know, so we don't get any like, you know,

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,300
porn or advertising and things like that.

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,360
So, uh, yeah.

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,420
Uh, basically the topics on there.

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,580
I think you, you might've, uh, looked at that and said that these are the things that

55
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,520
have been reoccurring from early days of Greek speak.

56
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,920
And by the way, regarding Greek speak, just before we get into the chat thing, I've been,

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,860
uh, ruminating on this whole project and trying to find a, a, a, a, let's say a format

58
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,700
to land on.

59
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,840
And the easiest thing for me to do since I'm kind of like this walking encyclopedia is to

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,860
delve in very deep on certain subjects and, uh, probably end up, uh, sending to you Chuck,

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,400
uh, hour long or two hour long solos that you put up, uh, that are, that'll be, uh, let's

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,320
say titled and time, time mark to a degree.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,760
So when I'm getting into a subject like water or getting into a subject like food, I will

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,880
express, for example, okay, we're getting to 18 minutes.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
Now we're going to talk about bread.

66
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,540
So it'll be easy to refer back to and things like that.

67
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,320
I, we spoke about this in the past and you may not get the intro or the outro, or you may

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,440
not hear Chuck, but it's still part of the project, uh, uh, only because it's easiest for

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,520
myself to do that.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,240
I can sit down and do one hour, almost pedantic sounding recording on water that I think

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:07,440
will benefit whoever gets it or food or a money system or history or the gods and all

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,120
this other stuff.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,260
So, because it'll get really rough on you if we start doing it, uh, whether it's a one

74
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,000
hour, two hour or truly in the Greek, it gets pretty rough, uh, to have, you know, to the

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,519
format that we're using right now.

76
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,079
You know what I mean?

77
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,520
Cause it's really hard to go back and forth if I'm getting into the groove, you know?

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh, right.

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,780
Well, so you get on these runs and, uh, it's, it's very interesting.

80
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,540
In matter of fact, that used to happen in private, uh, Skype discussions where you had a

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,740
little group together and we used to have these discussions.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,800
Uh, I, the one I remember best was, uh, it was about healing and wounds and things like

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,760
that, uh, which, uh, which I participated in with you, but, um, great, great stuff.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,580
Anyways, that, Oh, you know, you brought up water and, uh, I did recently add the, uh,

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,380
the, the old one that we did a while ago about water, which the information is really

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,400
solid and interesting.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,660
I added that to the rated Y playlist, um, in, in the absence of the, uh, uh, you know,

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,460
sonic recently just to, uh, provide something that they might've not heard unless they

89
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,160
were a subscriber at my site previously.

90
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,740
Uh, I figured that that was fair enough, uh, to let people know anything else you

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,180
think they'll add to the mix to give more value.

92
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,900
That is fine.

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,760
If you know anything, even if it's not with, um, what we're doing, if you find

94
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,760
something unusual enough, cause I think the folks here aren't unusual things, not

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,080
normal, right?

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
So yeah, uh, we'll, we'll continue the water.

97
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,160
We'll go a little deeper.

98
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,940
Uh, I could tell you right now, uh, myself and, um, recently regarding the water, uh,

99
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,340
there's a fellow making the rounds, Jonathan Buttes, uh, B U T T S, and he's pretty

100
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,100
popular and someone hooked him up with me.

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,640
So do you want to speak to him?

102
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,420
And I said, sure.

103
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, we started off basically, um, having a short meet and greet, but ended up being a

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,180
three hour call going back and forth.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,240
Uh, he is like the water guy right now out there.

106
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,480
And, uh, humbly saying, uh, by the end of the conversation, he said he learned a lot

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,960
by, uh, having that discussion.

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,960
He was very grateful, but what, what, what I could distill, no pun intended from the

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,680
conversation, both from his experience to more than two decades in mind of more than

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,820
two decades with working on water is, uh, I'm just going to give the short of it

111
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,700
because this is good for people to think about if they're interested in hearing the

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,280
water stuff.

113
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,960
There's a, the hydrogen economy, you know, using hydrogen and oxygen instead of

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,760
petrochemicals and petrofuels.

115
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,480
Right, right.

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,960
Well, one of the reasons that will never be mainstream and will never become popular

117
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,780
and will be suppressed is this.

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,020
When you're putting a regular fuel, whether it's propane or gasoline or whatever in

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,480
the engine, you're completely depleting the fuel on the exhaust pipe end, right?

120
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,340
You can't really take that exhaust and run it back through the system.

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,840
Well, if you have a hydrogen and oxygen generator, particularly the right kind,

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,940
let's say, which I will talk about how to make, uh, when you run that through the

123
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,360
engine, the engine with some modification will run.

124
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:10,940
Okay.

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,980
Well, what no one knows about or talks about, there are very few that know about

126
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,240
this.

127
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,740
What comes out of the exhaust pipe is about 99.9% of the same amount of hydrogen

128
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,480
and oxygen you put in on the front end.

129
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,740
Now, what they tell you popularly is, oh, you just burn hydrogen in your engine.

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,020
You get water as a by-product.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,500
Well, yeah, you have some water vapor, but let me just say that again.

132
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,780
If you are using hydrogen and oxygen or what they call cracking water to power your

133
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,600
combustionable engine, you will have 99% of that coming out the exhaust pipe.

134
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,600
What do you do with it?

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,460
You see, this is something that you can go on every hydrogen, oxygen, HHO, water

136
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,680
powered engine, water powered car website.

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,780
No one mentions this for two reasons.

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,960
One is there.

139
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,140
The main reason is because they're ignorant of it because they just came across the

140
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,980
technology, decided to make a website and make a car run on it.

141
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,520
The second thing is that if you start making that notion popular, I think it'll

142
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,320
bring more of a shit storm down on you than you would readily expect.

143
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,900
So I just wanted to put that out there because what I just said is not as, is not

144
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,940
public at all and easily verifiable.

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
So let's go back to the chat.

146
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,020
Yeah, go ahead.

147
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,400
Well, yeah, let's do go.

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,620
Let's do go back to the chat because, again, I brought up the water and that'll be a

149
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,659
future installment of maybe a solo one, maybe one of these discussions.

150
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,260
We'll see.

151
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,140
Probably a solo one.

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,300
Yeah, but this way it'll be, it'll be deep and you can, you could do what you want

153
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,620
with it.

154
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,820
When we have our discussions, it's more, it's easier listening, I think.

155
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,360
Maybe, depends.

156
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,540
Anyway, it depends on who you ask, I bet.

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,100
But either way, let's, let's go to this because, again, right, what did we start

158
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,620
out with?

159
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,920
I think very first time that we got together, in fact, was, well, what time is

160
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,140
it?

161
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,940
Lawful timekeeping and all that.

162
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,680
Now, that was, again, discussed in the chat and they were talking about the moon

163
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,740
and they were talking about by observation, what is it you can see?

164
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,720
Things like this.

165
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,960
And this, this goes into, well, a whole lot more than just the, you know, what, what,

166
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,860
what is it we used to call it?

167
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,180
The wind-up toy or the digital representation thereof, right?

168
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,760
Or atomic clock or whatever, hourglass, water drops.

169
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,060
Either way, an accounting, right, an accounting of time.

170
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,000
But what, what is lawful timekeeping?

171
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,100
You, you've been over this a hundred times, okay, because I know you went over it

172
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,560
with me, you went over it in brief.

173
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,080
Not too long ago on a radio show you were on even, again and again, and, and here we

174
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,280
are still dealing with the, you know, the wind-up toy and, well, daylight savings

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,220
just happened, as a matter of fact, not, not everywhere, but, you know, in some

176
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,020
places, right?

177
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,080
So we all have to retranslate what time it is in different places.

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,680
So, yeah, let's just, let's just go to that and that will lead us into some

179
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,140
discussion of the gods, I guess.

180
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,680
Well, yeah, well, the easiest way, when you say lawful means it's universally

181
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,340
applicable.

182
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,320
So if you, if you're dealing with something, let's say, let's, let's go around

183
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,400
it to go back to it.

184
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:32,680
Okay.

185
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,120
Universally applicable.

186
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,380
Let's say you are interacting with something, a methodology or whatever, and

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,500
you have to buy it, right?

188
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,580
Or you have to get it from somewhere, someone, you know, or you have to be

189
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,640
licensed to have it.

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
Or is that universally applicable?

191
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,060
No.

192
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,840
Right.

193
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,540
So if it's a, if we're talking about a windup toy or a clock, you make your own,

194
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,000
you're probably going to buy the parts, buy the technology or buy a clock, right?

195
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,280
Or one of those flip calendars or a cell phone, whatever, whatever time keeping

196
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,180
method you have, you're probably going to have to go into some commercial venue to

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,700
get it, right?

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,540
So if that commercial, if you don't have access to that commercial venue, or if

199
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,500
they stop making it, is it still universally applicable?

200
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,320
No.

201
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,700
You see, so lawfulness also with other law forms is universally applicable.

202
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,460
Lawful timekeeping in its applicability, for such a thing, that's the right way to

203
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,460
say it, is strictly by using what is available to everyone from an observer's

204
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,060
point of view.

205
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,880
When you're using the atomic clock, the windup toy, the digital, whatever, it's

206
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,780
still observational.

207
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,480
Let's say you're in a lab and you're doing an experiment, you want to do time, you

208
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
still have to bring in the observation from that time piece, right?

209
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,020
So time is always observable.

210
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,000
So in this case, leaning on the premise that we're going to be using the

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,640
astronomical bodies for timekeeping, that takes out the commercial aspect, doesn't

212
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,060
it?

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, entirely because it's accessible to anyone.

214
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,340
There's no license required.

215
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,620
You don't have to get any special permissions.

216
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,980
It is simply look up in the sky, right?

217
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:16,880
Yeah.

218
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,620
And if you're poor or rich, you have equal access, right?

219
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,840
So that's what I mean about universal applicability.

220
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,840
So in essence, this goes with every law form, by the way, and I've discussed it

221
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,160
before in depth, which we probably will again, what law is.

222
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,440
And actually, it goes back to the gods.

223
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,480
But OK, so the universal applicability of that timekeeping using the astronomical

224
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,360
bodies is the most viable also, because as time, because of its reliability, as

225
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,940
time changes, those bodies tend to keep their motions intact.

226
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,780
Right.

227
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,580
I gave an example years ago, you could still probably find them on eBay during

228
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,500
Stalinist Russia.

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
They had a 10 hour clock or a 20 hour clock.

230
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,740
They still have them on eBay, you know, and they had a 20 day calendar and all

231
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,420
these things. Right.

232
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,740
So that was for what?

233
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,060
That was for the USSR under Stalin, right?

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,660
But it didn't apply, you see, universally.

235
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,820
So the universal application of using the astronomical bodies, meaning the sun, the

236
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,140
moon and the stars, is what makes it lawful because it's accessible to everyone,

237
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,280
whether you're, let's just say everyone on the planet, let's say what we call the

238
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,100
planet. And that's what makes it reliable and that's what makes it lawful, period.

239
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,600
Right. The other problem that you have with that is the influx of culture, every

240
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,860
culture, every critic, every, as the ages change, they rely on a different aspect of

241
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,720
the moon. For example, the new moon now is the dark sliver that you view in the

242
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,400
West. Well, that really is not a reliable timepiece because can you measure that

243
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,480
down to the second or to the hour?

244
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,740
You really can't.

245
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,540
It's a generally it's over a three or four or six hour period.

246
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,060
It's very nebulous.

247
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,700
But if it's the full moon, which, by the way, if you look in the biblical text, you

248
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,720
could do a search. It does tell you the new moon is the full moon.

249
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,420
It is. There is a verse that actually has that in there.

250
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,760
But if you use the full moon, you could pretty much use your sundial.

251
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,920
Right, because the full moon will cast a very sharp shadow, you see, so that in an

252
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,860
essence, you know, if most people say new moon, they think it's the dark moon.

253
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,060
So these these these short little steps go into what it means to be, you know, having

254
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,420
a standard. Right.

255
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,420
The other standard would be a starts at solar noon.

256
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,180
Now, without going into history, fast forward into current academia.

257
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,900
When you take, let's say, astronomy or astrophysics as a curriculum, you will have

258
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,360
for about 15 minutes in every curriculum, even community colleges for about 15 minutes

259
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,980
or one chapter in the textbook.

260
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,060
It will tell you that the full moon, I mean, sorry, at solar noon is when the day

261
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,500
starts. The day starts at solar noon for astronomical and scientific purposes.

262
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,520
It's even in the college books, not midnight, because that's like I said, the

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,200
culture wants you to have midnight.

264
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:31,680
All right. So when you look at the language, right, when people fast for a day, they

265
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440
break their fast at the end of the day.

266
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,180
So when do you have break fast?

267
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,160
Right. At the end of the day, which is the morning in the Bible, you have it was

268
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,320
evening. It was morning.

269
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,480
It was the first day.

270
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,660
Well, when does OK, so if the day starts, it goes from evening to morning.

271
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,780
That's the end of the day.

272
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,920
So the end of morning is the end of the day.

273
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,960
Right. And the cycle repeats evening to morning again.

274
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,960
Well, when does morning end at noon?

275
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,820
At noon. You see this with people today with the clock.

276
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,320
You ever notice like you get on a conversation and they'll say good morning, but it's

277
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,600
twelve oh one and they'll notice it and they'll say, oh, I'm sorry.

278
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,060
Good afternoon. Right.

279
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,360
I've heard this my whole life.

280
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
Right. You know, it's twelve oh three.

281
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,960
Oh, I'm sorry. It's good afternoon.

282
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,280
OK, so going by the clock now, the wind up to twelve noon by the clock could be off by

283
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,000
forty five minutes to an hour and a half, depending on the season, because it's close

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,600
enough. So you have the solar noon is when the day starts.

285
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,420
Also, if you remember the old banking convention, if you grew up in the 60s or 70s, by

286
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,680
the 80s, they stopped this.

287
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,860
If you deposited a check after noon on the clock, they counted it as the next day.

288
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,400
I don't know if you guys remember that.

289
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,200
Oh, I do. Anybody here old enough?

290
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,780
I do. Yeah, because they that was the banking convention, because the banking, believe it

291
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,100
or not, goes back to the system of banking that's being used today, which we'll

292
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,180
probably discuss a little bit today as well, is is very ancient.

293
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,900
Right. And it doesn't go back to a lot of the people always try to leave, like the

294
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,960
Jordan Maxwell's and all the David Ikes and all these other guys always tell you it's a

295
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,880
Babylonian system.

296
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,400
It's not it's not a Babylonian system at all.

297
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,400
Some of the culture is borrowed from Babylon.

298
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,920
It's an Egyptian system.

299
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,540
But just to not lean so negatively on those guys that I just mentioned, Babylon and

300
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:30,300
Egypt were sister cities, just like New York and London are very close.

301
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,320
Right. So if something happens in New York regarding culture, fashion or finance, it's

302
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,240
going to affect London.

303
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,860
Right. And, you know, like you have in the fashion industry, the triad of Paris, London,

304
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,200
New York. So in fashion, something affects Paris.

305
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,900
It's going to get those other two cities as well.

306
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,600
So that's the relationship with Babylon.

307
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,240
But it is not a Babylonian based system.

308
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,600
And I think I've gotten into that in the past.

309
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,280
If there's interest on it, I could show how with more interest go into depth.

310
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,460
It will require me for me to do a bunch of research to bring references out.

311
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,460
But essentially, for lawful timekeeping, understanding the crux of the matter is this.

312
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,540
The full moon determines the month and the solar noon determines the day.

313
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,440
And this is basically for record keeping.

314
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,000
This is how you keep your records, basically, in terms of lawful timekeeping.

315
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,600
But if you live this way, you will find yourself in more harmony versus disharmony that

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,380
the collective that only knows midnight and whatever.

317
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,960
Actually, they have no reckoning for the month.

318
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:49,580
What's interesting is you see in just popular culture browser news pages, full moon

319
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,840
tonight, right? Yes.

320
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,220
The most people relate to that would be like, oh, it's so beautiful or some crazy

321
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,540
things might happen, man, because people act weird during the full moon.

322
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,120
That's the extent of it.

323
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,000
They have no idea what that really means in terms of any other aspect.

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,700
Right. So they're completely disconnected from the monthly cycle.

325
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,520
There's, of course, there's the monthly cycle that women have or the female of our

326
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,820
species, let's say, and other species.

327
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,120
But that's it. They're completely disconnected.

328
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,240
They're also completely the collectives completely disconnected from solar noon being

329
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,520
the beginning of the day where if they well, what they're connected to is midnight.

330
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,120
But if they were connected to solar noon as being the beginning of the day, they would

331
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,660
have a radical sense of change in there and reharmonizing, you see, completely.

332
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,080
I mean, once you acknowledge to yourself personally that the day starts at solar noon

333
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,300
and you admit it to yourself and you acknowledge it, you will notice a different

334
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,300
focus, a subtle change within your life that will put you in harmony with everything

335
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,920
else that follows that, which is what what else follows this lawful timekeeping?

336
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,720
Well, the earth, the weather, the whales, the bugs, the dogs, the cats.

337
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:20,080
Right. Well, I have noticed that people that are most interested in cultivating plants,

338
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,180
if they take this into their minds, it's very helpful, actually.

339
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:32,020
Because farming is you cannot separate any good almanac as a lunar cycle for planting.

340
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,720
Right. That's what I was going to bring up.

341
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,760
Exactly. And there's a reason for that.

342
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,420
And it doesn't make sense if you look at the Pope's work schedule, because there is no

343
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,580
ending or beginning that makes any sort of sense according to the way they have the

344
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,540
months laid out there.

345
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,300
Because look at where your moons lay, you know, even the calendars that show you where

346
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,980
the moon begins, ends, is at a halfway point, all of that, there is no logical through

347
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,080
line there. They have a what you'll notice is that for about two or three years, they

348
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,880
have a pretty close run where the full moon comes up the first few days of their

349
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
month. Right.

350
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,200
Well, we're at that point right now.

351
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,320
Again, yeah, you'll notice there's a run on that.

352
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,180
And by the way, the intercalation I just wanted to bring up where you have a 13th

353
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,580
moon, that's intercalation.

354
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,780
That's that's not really making things fit.

355
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,380
That's just running the cycles as they are, meaning you'll have a longer monthly

356
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,200
cycle within a year, which regarding the months you will have, you will have 400 days

357
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,040
in about 390 days in a year from the what where you have the lunar division.

358
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,380
But the year based on, let's say, what they talk about the sun going around the sky and

359
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,880
coming back to where it was is still around 360, 365.

360
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,920
And this is this gets complicated.

361
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,040
But keeping intercalation keeps things very neat, meaning when do you have a 13th moon?

362
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,500
Right. And maybe that's that's actually maybe something I should get into on a short,

363
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,180
fast sonic and to give the emotion of the moon being independent.

364
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,480
So I always balk at when people are, well, they were on a lunar calendar.

365
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,560
There's no really such thing as a lunar only calendar.

366
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,340
Right. Because then when does your day start?

367
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,080
You still rely on the sun.

368
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,960
But the point of the intercalation of having a 13th moon is not even to make things fit

369
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,040
neatly. It's just to respect how that cycle has its own cycle within a cycle.

370
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,820
It's kind of like a planetary gear.

371
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,340
When you open a watch, the back of a watch, you see all these gears intermeshing.

372
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,540
Right. And they're all different sizes.

373
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,620
Right. Well, with the moon having an intercalation where you have a 13th month, which

374
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,280
was last year, by the way, is like imagine the gears not being circular, but being

375
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,340
elliptical. That's the easiest way to imagine it.

376
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,100
Right. So instead of having circular gears on the back of a watch, some of them are

377
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,420
elliptical or the one that's lunar is it has an elliptical shape where the sun tends to

378
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,320
be more circular. Now, there's different ways to explain this and there's different

379
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,380
there's no why on that, but it just happens to be that way.

380
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,540
And it works out fine.

381
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,400
You know, once you understand it, I have typically found that there's three to four

382
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,760
minimum of actually three, most likely four 13 month years every 10 years or every nine

383
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,180
years, I should say. So about just about a third of them.

384
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,300
Right. So that's pretty much on the lawful timekeeping.

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,620
And basically it's not something you can fully grasp and then use it.

386
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,980
It's one of those things that it's kind of like a bicycle, you know, you have to the

387
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,520
more you ride it, the better you.

388
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,100
Right. So just start acknowledging when these things are happening and then it'll

389
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,540
start to click and make sense to you because it's more than just being cognitive,

390
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:04,340
you know. Right. So you can I could lecture on this for hours to someone who is not

391
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,440
aware of it. And even though they think they got it, let's say they scored really well

392
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,400
on a quiz. Right. And they've never observed it or used it before.

393
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,580
They'll be they'll be befuddled, though they will still won't get it right because it

394
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,000
takes the experience. So it takes anywhere between one to three years to kind of get

395
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,960
it. It's one of those things like a bicycle.

396
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,660
If you've never ridden a bicycle before, do you say, well, I'll just save it for that

397
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,120
day. I'll I'll get on it on next Thursday.

398
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,300
I've never ridden one before.

399
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,980
And I think by the end of the day, I'll be fine.

400
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,980
No, it doesn't work that way.

401
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,000
Right. You have to practice.

402
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,540
Yeah, well, people call it practice, but it's just the more you develop, you refine

403
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,900
your your actions become, you know, you're not thinking about them anymore.

404
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,400
They're just actions you take.

405
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,520
And that's kind of the way it goes.

406
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,960
Right. I mean, some people call that muscle memory or whatever, where it's just you're so

407
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,840
used to doing something, it becomes, you know, secondary nature like it's.

408
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,660
Yeah, it's recognition.

409
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,520
Cognition means to know, let's say.

410
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,620
And when you say recognize, it's literally saying recognition means you're re-knowing.

411
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,660
So when someone says to you, do you recognize this?

412
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,220
And it's familiar. What you're doing is comparing it.

413
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,260
It's just like imagine an AI camera looking at an object and comparing it to another

414
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,500
reference of that object.

415
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,880
Right. That's what's really happening.

416
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,240
So when someone asks you, do you recognize this?

417
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,840
What you're really doing is taking whatever input you have, visual, audio, whatever

418
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,480
touch, and comparing it to your previous knowledge of what you think the subject matter

419
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,380
is. Right. And it's never exactly the same.

420
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,160
And you just keep adding to your knowledge base.

421
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,660
That's why that's where that's where recognition comes from.

422
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
It's never exactly the same.

423
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,720
So if you're reading Braille, for example, you're not going to be using your sight.

424
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,200
It'll be purely touch.

425
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,880
So recognition is not only visual, it's audible, it's touch, smell, taste.

426
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,480
So whenever we sense something, it adds to our previous knowledge of that thing.

427
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,800
Once we know what the subject matter is and where we should access it.

428
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
So that's how the time keeping works for every month and every day that you start

429
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,680
acknowledging that you're seeking to use the astronomical bodies.

430
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,320
You will be learning more and more every day and every month.

431
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,380
I've never seen. And here's the here's the other thing I did.

432
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,420
No one held me by the hand and said, Greek, this is lawful timekeeping.

433
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,500
Believe it or not. So in the beginning, when I first was searching this,

434
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,460
I thought I was inventing stuff.

435
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,020
Right. Because I can't be midnight.

436
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,300
You can't you know, it's got to be sundown.

437
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,540
Well, it can't be sundown because you can't. Right.

438
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,320
So when I can't be the sliver, the dark moon, it's got to be the full.

439
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm like, what? I couldn't find any information on this at all.

440
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,320
Anywhere. Just little pieces here and there.

441
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,480
So I say, what am I doing here?

442
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
Am I inventing some kind of a system where the day starts at noon and the full moon is

443
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
that am I like being inventive?

444
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,080
So I said, let me just go out there and see how this works and now start probing

445
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,320
little pieces of history and see how it fits.

446
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,100
And believe it or not, everything fit together really well.

447
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,800
So that's the sad thing I've always told people, go try to find lawful timekeeping.

448
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,800
You're never going to find anywhere that the day starts at noon.

449
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,000
The full moon is the new moon and how to reckon everything, you know.

450
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,340
By the way, just an interjection on lawful timekeeping.

451
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,740
Look up on references and they tell you the lunar month is like twenty eight point nine

452
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,580
four or twenty nine point three days.

453
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,360
Yeah. OK, it's never.

454
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,380
Well, if that's because they do the day starting at midnight.

455
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,440
But if you start the day at solar noon, it's exactly 30 days, 30 or 31 days

456
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,540
in the summertime, in the summer months.

457
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,620
Hmm. Isn't that interesting how just acknowledging solar noon as being the beginning

458
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,920
of the day, you end up having a perfect 30 day lunar count.

459
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,220
Is that amazing? So it's very interesting that.

460
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,600
Yeah. I mean, especially because it seems like, well, that's fairly close to what the

461
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,140
Pope's work schedule looks like.

462
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,180
But it's what's 12 hours.

463
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,860
Yeah. About midnight to solar noon.

464
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,780
Right. It's 12 hours front or back, but it's still 12 hours off, which is 50 percent of

465
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,120
the day. And they're already telling you it's twenty eight point nine or twenty nine

466
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,080
point one. When you add 50, right, it ends up being 30 with that math just

467
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,680
mathematically. So what were you going to say about the Pope's work schedule?

468
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,620
Well, it almost seems like somebody took a snapshot of one proper year and decided to

469
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,820
keep using it, you know, is what it seems like.

470
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,100
Well, you mean the current one from the Popple Bull 1580 something, but they started

471
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,560
around five the year 500 A.D.

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,700
They had it pretty much it took them.

473
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,900
They couldn't get this on everyone until the sixteen hundred, seventeen hundreds,

474
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,640
really. It's fairly, in other words, the calendar that everyone uses everywhere in the

475
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,400
world right now hasn't been used the way it is for more than 150 years.

476
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,320
It's very recent. To prove this, you could look up on a browser.

477
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,500
You notice I don't say Google this.

478
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
Well, I hear a lot of people say, why don't you Google this?

479
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,040
But anyway, it's still going to go through Google.

480
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,720
But good research.

481
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,780
Just do a quick browser. Why does George Washington have two birthdays?

482
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,080
And he does, because at that point they they decided to eliminate a week.

483
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,260
So he has two birthdays, the one that was inscribed when in real time when he was born.

484
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,720
And then when they changed the calendar in 51, they 1751 again, they went and changed

485
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,820
what the day he was born retrospectively.

486
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,720
So in other words, we don't really other than myself and maybe someone else I'd never

487
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,980
heard of is talking about the importance of lawful timekeeping and all this.

488
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,620
But if we went back in history, 150 or 200 years, it was a mess.

489
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
It wasn't standard like it is today.

490
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,260
Well, at least it's standardized.

491
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,900
Right. At least it is.

492
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,540
By the way, even if you go back and read, I was big on I was like, I'm going to prove

493
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,700
the American Revolution never happened, as we're told.

494
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,440
Right. Kind of like I'm going to prove the Bay of Tompkins or whatever was a false

495
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,980
flag. Right. Kind of thing.

496
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,420
And it was it didn't really happen the way we were told.

497
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,360
But and at that time, I was a little confused because you would have

498
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,220
something dated as June on the top.

499
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,200
But the paragraph in the opening of the article would start reading in this fourth

500
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,720
month of the year or whatever.

501
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,680
But it's June. Yeah, right.

502
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,400
You see. Right. Which, according to the Pope's work, schedules the sixth month.

503
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,100
Now it is. But then they would consider June to be the fourth month.

504
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,380
So this is how I put it all together in terms of this.

505
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,340
These things were known and changed.

506
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,280
You see, it's very subtle.

507
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:21,100
Here's the there's something that I if I were to pretty much nail down what we're

508
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,680
doing with Greek speak always is from the beginning, even before I started even

509
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,620
speaking publicly on the Internet.

510
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,740
I used to speak at venues here in Tucson in the early 2000s.

511
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,220
Peak perception, can you keep your your perception at a peak so when you hear

512
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,040
something or see something, an idea, see any otherwise will entertain any idea.

513
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,760
Right. It doesn't mean you have to accept it.

514
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,020
I can. If you told me, you know, this is the moon is made of cheese.

515
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,820
I'll listen. You know, you can't just say it's made of cheese and stop.

516
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,140
You have to back it up somehow.

517
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,860
Right. Right. I'll listen.

518
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,280
It doesn't mean I have to accept it.

519
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,120
Right. So you keep your perception peak.

520
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,840
And then the other thing is you have to realize, just like I said earlier, I

521
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,380
thought I invented this thing with lawful timekeeping because I couldn't do one

522
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,980
stop shopping and find out that the day started at solar noon and the full moon

523
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,040
was the first day of the month.

524
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,520
Nowhere. So when I started piecing it together, well, it can't be this and it

525
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,820
must be that I thought it was only one on the planet.

526
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,280
And actually, I am that can put it in one spot like that.

527
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,960
Right. So it kind of made me realize that I have to get away from that and go

528
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,180
back out there and see, do we have enough hints we could piece together that the

529
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,580
full moon is the first day of the month and the day starts at solar noon?

530
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,400
And the answer to that is hell, yeah, because throughout history and even today

531
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,380
in academia, as I said, you will find that.

532
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,240
That concept, again, that the day starts, the month starts with the full moon and

533
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,960
the day starts at solar noon is is firmly implanted, but it's very, very, very

534
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,360
subtle.

535
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,440
OK, well, what do you mean by it's very, very subtle, though?

536
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,920
Oh, you won't find it all in one place.

537
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,380
Yeah, OK, so it's scattered about, but, you know, so it's not all in one.

538
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,420
Like you said, look, you're not going to find one book, let's say, that's going to

539
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,460
explain this to you.

540
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,240
Yeah. And you don't even need a book.

541
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,960
You can do it in a simple phrase.

542
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,000
All right. Fair enough.

543
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,140
Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,280
It's just astounding.

545
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,860
But then again, you can apply to any law form, you know, they have laws of physics,

546
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,640
right? Right.

547
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,180
So but they and they attribute it to Isaac Newton.

548
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,820
All right. Well, there's an entire category that's called non-Newtonian physics

549
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,220
where liquids don't behave the way right.

550
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,020
Objects don't in motion don't behave the way that Newton said they should.

551
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,500
Right. They don't fit the standard formulas and all that.

552
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:57,020
And what's happening as time goes by, the non-Newtonian aspect of our reality

553
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,240
is starting to overcome the Newtonian aspect.

554
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,540
Right. Right.

555
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,920
So which one is real?

556
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,860
You know, the subtle again, back to the subtleness of it.

557
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,239
If you're follow if you're a part of the collective and you're doing the Pope's

558
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,040
work schedule on the clock, you know, the day starts at midnight, you're going to

559
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,940
be disharmonious and you're going to be seeking you're always going to feel like

560
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,520
superficially may not be admitted by those in the collective, but they're always

561
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,699
going to feel an emptiness, like something's missing, something's not quite

562
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,560
right. And you hear this all the time, by the way, from the collective.

563
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,380
Right. And one of the main things of that is that you're disoriented

564
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,340
because orientation is an orienteering and orientation has to do with

565
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,440
maps and how to navigate.

566
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,739
And one of the things about navigation is speed and time and where you are in time.

567
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,260
So feel sorry for them or not.

568
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,840
The collective will never, ever be in harmony for one of the reasons

569
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,700
simply is because they will never, ever encounter or contemplate or partake in

570
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,560
lawful timekeeping.

571
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,280
I know it's kind of a big statement to make, but I assure you part of the whole

572
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,780
that they sense in their spirit and their mind and their existence is lawful

573
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,000
timekeeping because they're totally you know, their lives run on time.

574
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,060
Right. Well, yeah, essentially everything you do begins with what time do you have

575
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,780
to do it? When do you when does something happen?

576
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,740
What is the time that you have to depart or to go to, you know, work or whatever it

577
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,400
is, everything is based on time.

578
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,520
So without it, let's just say you wanted to abandon timekeeping altogether.

579
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,380
You can't and function with others.

580
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,240
Right. I mean, just but the thing is, the time system that they're using is

581
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,660
disharmonious with the physical environment, the natural environment.

582
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,440
Right. And when you say natural environment, it's, you know, living objects and

583
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,800
nonliving objects. Right.

584
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,460
So they're completely effed.

585
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,680
We could we could. This is not a child's program.

586
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,540
Right. Not at all. They're fucked.

587
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,420
Yeah. Basically, just from that aspect alone.

588
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,600
Well, there's an entire reason you can keep going down the line.

589
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,100
Speaking of something going down the line, just to diverge a little bit.

590
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,580
We were talking about months and days and all that.

591
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,000
This past Thursday on which it's twenty twenty three March.

592
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,360
Right.

593
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,160
Mm hmm.

594
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,840
Nineteen thirty three March Thursday was also the ninth.

595
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,900
This year was the ninth on a Thursday.

596
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,440
And what I've been doing to be going around, I said, you guys ever heard of the

597
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,880
Fourth of July's people out for about a week now?

598
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,660
And my favorite answer when I ask someone, have you ever heard of the Fourth of

599
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,840
July? They're like, yeah, I heard of it.

600
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,840
It's the day that comes after July 3rd, meaning like they don't give a shit.

601
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,200
Which I totally agree with.

602
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,020
Right. Yeah.

603
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,340
But I said, have you ever heard of March the 9th, 1933?

604
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,160
You're like, no.

605
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,980
Well, that's when this country, this country, meaning I'm in the U.S.

606
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,260
of A right now in Arizona state.

607
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,360
You notice I didn't say state of Arizona.

608
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,480
It's not the same thing.

609
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,600
And that's when this country pretty much got a

610
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,980
what do you call when you shoot someone right between the eyes or right in the

611
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,520
head with a large caliber gun?

612
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,440
Dead. Pretty much.

613
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,200
If you will. The death shot.

614
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,580
OK. Death shot.

615
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,280
Yeah. Now, let me let me mention something here.

616
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,200
If you put in March the 9th, 1933 and you're in the U.S.,

617
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,680
they're not hiding this, by the way.

618
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,360
Google will start from the top 10 pages down just talking about what's called the

619
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,000
EBA Emergency Banking Act.

620
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,260
And they want it. They want you to read it.

621
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,780
It's only two and a half paragraphs.

622
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,960
All right. So if you understand legalese, you could realize how screwed you are,

623
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,440
especially when they reference the statute of 1917.

624
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,760
What's that?

625
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,640
Well, you go back and read that. That's pretty long.

626
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,040
But I'll give you a short thing on it.

627
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,140
That's when they did trading with the Enemies Act.

628
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,820
Well, when you're at war, you can't trade with the countries we're at war with.

629
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,920
But in March the 9th, 1933, they went and amended that.

630
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,320
And guess what they did?

631
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,840
They included U.S. citizens in the trading with the Enemy Act.

632
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,340
That now U.S. citizens are enemies of the United States.

633
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,540
Why would they do that?

634
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,140
Because if the people ever found out what they did on March the 9th, 1933, it would

635
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,100
be like the end of a Frankenstein movie.

636
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,640
And right. You know, he shows up.

637
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,320
People showed up with pitchforks, right.

638
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,440
And torches, right. Going after the castle.

639
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,160
Okay. So how did they hide it from the people?

640
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,320
By publishing it.

641
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,300
It doesn't make any sense what I just said, but I assure you that's what they did.

642
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
No, it makes perfect sense.

643
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,000
It reminds me of what Alan Dulles said about the Warren Commission volumes.

644
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,140
Of course, publish it. That'll make sure that no one reads it.

645
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,620
Exactly. You know, and that was Alan Dulles, who, if you don't know who he was, you

646
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,620
know, go ahead and look that one up somewhere.

647
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,600
You know, I'm not going to use the Google phrase either.

648
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,960
Yeah. And what's more important about Dulles that I believe it's not just him alone.

649
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,800
He was part of the Dulles brothers, wasn't he?

650
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,540
Yes, he was. Right. John Foster and Alan.

651
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,500
Yes. Yeah. It wasn't just one.

652
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah. So it was twice as bad.

653
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,260
Right. Mm hmm.

654
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,080
Yeah.

655
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,020
Very interesting subject there.

656
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,040
But OK, it's fascinating to me because I've heard others

657
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,580
say that indeed, if you are partaking in certain

658
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,060
things in society, you are literally an enemy of the state.

659
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,160
And yeah, it was declared that way.

660
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,760
Now, let me just say what I've heard other people say.

661
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,920
I'm not saying that it's accurate.

662
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,260
I'm just saying that it reminds me of what they were saying.

663
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,080
They never explained it, though.

664
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah. Yeah, that's we can't we can't.

665
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,680
It's very simple why I say sort of I can I can give you a very strong defense for it.

666
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,100
Let's replace the the word state with, I don't know, ice cream shop.

667
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,800
OK, ice cream. OK.

668
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,480
Enemies of the ice cream shop.

669
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,980
OK. Of the ice cream shop. OK.

670
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,280
So the ice cream shop, like the state's been there, it's been a fixture in society

671
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,020
for a long time. People regarded in favor.

672
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,060
They've some venerated, some don't like it, whatever.

673
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,460
It's been in town for a long time.

674
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,840
Well, they get into some shady business dealings to the point where they have to go

675
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,440
bankrupt. But the and now when they do declare bankruptcy with some shady business

676
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,000
deals with some private bankers, the private bankers and then have a meeting and say,

677
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,600
OK, we're bankrupt. All right.

678
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,700
All right. We're just going to say, uncle, do what you want.

679
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,780
And they say, well, you know what?

680
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,240
Why shut you down and tear down the business?

681
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,460
You're part of society.

682
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,580
You're a fixture here.

683
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,400
Everybody. People don't really know what's going on.

684
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,260
You know, why do we want to alarm the community and shut down the ice cream shop?

685
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,880
Why don't we keep it running?

686
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,160
But instead of just declaring tell the people were shut down for a few days for

687
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,040
bankruptcy, we're going to stay open under what's called a receivership, because

688
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,100
when there's a bankruptcy, you liquidate everything to pay the creditors who you owe

689
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,400
money to or the creditors can opt to what's called a receivership.

690
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,000
Keep the business going.

691
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,500
The current owners or principals or administrators are replaced with our people.

692
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,260
Everything that comes in comes to us.

693
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,960
So and whatever we want to give to those who run the shop, we give and we stay in

694
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,060
place. That's the state.

695
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,100
It doesn't exist. It's in receivership to the private banks.

696
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,000
And this has been very clear in March.

697
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,220
The ninth took till 1934, 1938.

698
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:41,340
With the precedent of Tompkins versus Erie Railroad, they changed the entire

699
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,600
judicial system to law of contract.

700
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,880
So it really took till after the World War II to be in the situation that you're in

701
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,260
right now. Now, let's go back to what I was saying.

702
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,420
By the way, you know, I haven't really hammered on the receivership for a long

703
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,240
time, but was that easy to see?

704
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,700
Yeah, I was thinking back to the the pizza shops, actually, that, yeah, well, you

705
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,700
and I are from a similar area in the country.

706
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,580
You remember the pizza shops that got taken down, right?

707
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,560
The whole pizza connection thing.

708
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,100
They almost all of them went into receivership afterwards where the pizza shop

709
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,820
shut down for a couple of days, just like you described with the, you know, the ice

710
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:31,140
cream shop. And they went into bankruptcy and they were all taken out because they

711
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,420
were involved in this, you know, heroin trafficking and whatnot.

712
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,460
And then they reopened and it was under new management.

713
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,640
Right. The name was a little different, but pretty close to the same.

714
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,860
The pizza, you know, the name remained the same.

715
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,960
Right. Some of the employees even remained the same.

716
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,340
Sure. The location, all of it.

717
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,920
They didn't change much, but there was new people running it.

718
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,840
And they were now not, you know, the previous owners were no longer the owners.

719
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,020
They took them away or whatever.

720
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,740
And now it was different people doing the business.

721
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,620
It didn't change. Yeah.

722
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,480
Yeah. It's called receivership.

723
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,420
It's very common to talk about bankruptcy.

724
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,360
People have heard of it. Very few people know much about it, but no one talks about

725
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,500
receivership. And that's the most common outcome for most large bankruptcies.

726
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,560
We're not talking about corporations that are just on paper, you know, that get

727
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,280
dissolved or banks and things like that.

728
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,300
But here's the important part, is that what the analogy that I gave is pretty close

729
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:38,020
to any as accurate as any as anyone would study this technically legal, the legal and

730
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
lawful aspect of bankruptcy to receivership.

731
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,120
I give that analogy. It resembles as close as possible to what is done.

732
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,720
The other thing is the way because it was public, that means it's illicit.

733
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,800
In other words, because all everything that I said and this has happened to every

734
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,300
country, by the way, and some form or another in Canada, it was done before the US.

735
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,900
It was done in England before World War One.

736
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,800
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

737
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,540
You go down the line and you'll find every country has the same situation.

738
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,640
Right. Since the eighteen hundreds till nineteen fifties with a lot of the countries

739
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,680
in Asia. OK, same thing.

740
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:20,020
But because it's so public and no one seems to care or know and it's so insidious at

741
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,020
the same time, you can consider all the states and governments to be running as an

742
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,160
illicit operation.

743
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,620
No, no, no, much worse than what you find on the dark web, you know, like hit men for

744
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:38,540
hire, prostitution, child trafficking, drug trafficking, all this stuff that you find

745
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,240
in the underworld is being done right in front of your faces out in the open and no

746
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,760
one seems to care. You see what I mean?

747
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,200
So it's an illicit operation.

748
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,320
Now, when you're running an illicit operation known as the modern state or all those

749
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,300
other things I mentioned, you find on the dark web, let's say you're running an

750
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,800
illicit operation out of a warehouse or a house or something.

751
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,200
The people that are part of the organization that are dealing with the public or

752
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,620
interacting with the public, the less they know about the inner goings of the inner of

753
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,120
the inner doings of the inner organization, the better.

754
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,600
Right. Because if the people that you have working for you, let's say, know a lot

755
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,580
about what's going on, it's going to slip when they interact with the public.

756
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,680
So it's best for them not to know the less they know, the better.

757
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,180
Where am I going with this?

758
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:37,180
When you go speak to a politician, any politician, they don't know any of this that

759
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,460
I just mentioned, the bankruptcy, the receivership.

760
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,960
They might have heard some, but they don't know anything about it.

761
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,760
Right. You speak to an attorney, you don't know anything about this kind of stuff or

762
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,880
law. Right.

763
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,300
You see. So this is done deliberately.

764
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,700
So one of the failures that you have in society is the people that people look up to

765
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,480
as professionals know nothing about what they're supposed to be knowing about, because

766
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,440
if they did, it would they call it a Freudian slip.

767
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,540
It would trickle out into the public and then you might have a movement on your hands.

768
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,800
Right. So but it's interesting.

769
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,760
I've challenged many people over the years who have family members, let's say, who are

770
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,780
doctors and lawyers.

771
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,840
I said, go ask him this.

772
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,640
He's a doctor. And it's by the way, ask him this question.

773
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,200
And you know what? I'll tell you what answer he's going to give you before you ask him.

774
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,140
So they go, guy's dad or whoever is a doctor goes ask him a couple of questions from

775
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,380
Greek speak. And the guy responds back exactly the way I said he would, as if they're not

776
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,360
even as if there's a pre-programmed life form.

777
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,860
So the same with lawyers and all this other stuff.

778
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,000
It's very easy to to see what's going on and how ridiculous it is from that aspect.

779
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,140
OK, so I just wanted to bring that up because, you know, one thing we might in the

780
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,840
future talk more about current events, because people here come here for Greek speak,

781
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,260
which, of course, is why you should be coming here.

782
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,640
But I know that you're also aware of what's being put out in the media and alternative

783
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,180
media, which is the same, by the way, because alternative media looks at the mainstream,

784
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,800
what they're saying, and they try to dissect it and tell you what's really going on.

785
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,800
And they're really not because they're just either they do that or they attempt to just be

786
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,660
the contrarian to which is, you know, just as pointless because, you know, well, I'm just

787
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:28,560
going to reject everything that they said because no, no sort of, you know, analytical

788
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,260
approach to it. Just well, we'll just take the opposite stance.

789
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,820
Well, that's that's important that you said that analytical, very important, because that

790
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:45,420
analysis is part of rational dialogue, rational, you know, interaction and logic, right?

791
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,980
Being rational with someone, but they're not.

792
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:54,540
And recently I came across a few things that I might be speaking on in public on a venue.

793
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,820
I'm not sure which one it is.

794
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,120
I'm not sure if it's set in stone.

795
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,320
If it was, I'd say who it was.

796
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:06,280
But it's a pretty popular Internet platform and most likely the talk will be about the

797
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,300
mass media. And my point of view will be very different.

798
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,200
You've heard of like all these organizations that are challenging the mass media like

799
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,600
Veritas or Loose Change back in the day with 9-11 and all this other stuff.

800
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:26,740
OK, the reason they're failing or seem contraire and are easy to be laughed at by the

801
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,840
collective. What do these organizations do?

802
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:37,720
They present the themselves against the mass media using rational logic, evidence, right?

803
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,120
Proper timeline.

804
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,740
Right. And they're being ignored.

805
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,400
The problem with the reason why they're being ignored is because they think by doing

806
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,720
that they will get headway because their opponent, meaning the mass media, is rational

807
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,700
and logic. They're not.

808
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,500
So the way you deal with the mass media and their followers is the same way that you

809
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,160
would deal with people who are insane.

810
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,740
So what I did before we started, I thought about this because I've been thinking about

811
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:09,360
it for a few days. I went online and I did a quick browser search.

812
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,180
What do you do with someone who is crazy or how do you treat crazy people?

813
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,280
And there's a whole bunch of articles by psychologists and psychiatrists.

814
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,800
Right. And you could I don't have to go over it.

815
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,860
You can imagine what it is.

816
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,160
Don't deal with them.

817
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,940
Don't tell them you understand.

818
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,140
Don't comply.

819
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,600
Keep them safe. Right.

820
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,720
Keep them contained. General stuff like that.

821
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,460
Right. That's how you deal with the mass media.

822
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,220
They're crazy. The way you would deal with them because they've already shown that they

823
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,840
cannot deal with rationale and logic and evidence and real timeline.

824
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,040
And they can't do.

825
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,260
So that's crazy people.

826
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,520
So the way you deal with mass media and their followers is no different than the crazy

827
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,500
bag lady walking down the street yelling at the telephone pole.

828
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,720
Exactly the same.

829
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:06,120
So once the quote unquote people in the alternative media notice this, this is one way

830
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,320
to deal with it. I think it's a major be a major milestone if they start doing this is

831
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,300
to not let's say something happens.

832
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:20,000
They come up with their own website or whatever venue they have and they start saying,

833
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,460
look at this thing happened in the news.

834
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,820
What about they didn't talk about this, this, this, this and that.

835
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,780
Yeah. You're presenting rational logic, evidence and a real timeline, all this to someone

836
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,980
who's insane. These people are crazy.

837
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,020
What are you doing? You need to be calling the paddy, you know, a wagon.

838
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:43,700
The guys in white uniform need to put them in a straight jacket in a padded room so they

839
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,740
don't hurt themselves. Right.

840
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,340
That's how you deal with the media.

841
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,720
So initially, the only way to deal with the mass media at this point, because they cannot

842
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,100
deal with rationale and logic is, first of all, extreme sarcasm.

843
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,520
Right. Avoidance and containment.

844
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,800
Now, it would be very difficult to physically remove them from the planet because most of

845
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,500
they've also captured the allegiance of most of the population.

846
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,780
But the most rational way to deal with the irrational is find out what protocols are in

847
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,700
place on how to deal with crazy people or insane people in that essence.

848
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,840
What do you think of that? I think that's fascinating.

849
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,380
And not in other words, don't present evidence, don't present a rational argument.

850
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,200
It's way past that point.

851
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,520
Now it's lock them up, you know, keep them keep them away from the children.

852
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,220
Right. Imagine if you've ever been around before where a quote unquote crazy person goes

853
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,780
buck wild and starts running around.

854
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,580
We're not talking about the guy on the Staten Island ferry with a sword, but let's say a

855
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,200
guy starts picking up garbage cans and throwing poop at people.

856
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,140
Right. Yep. I've seen that.

857
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,700
What do you do? First of all, you stay clear of his range.

858
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,920
Yep. Right. Try to get some help.

859
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,440
And how are we going to put an end to this?

860
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,160
Right. Not present to him a report on that.

861
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,540
You know how this is bad for you.

862
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,120
That's way past that point.

863
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,500
Right. Right now, somebody has to come and contain him.

864
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,760
Somebody who is equipped to do so.

865
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,560
But they're not. Yeah. Well, we've talked about that to the mop up crew.

866
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,960
Which leads us to the gods, doesn't it?

867
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,000
Well, it definitely does. Real quick before you move on to there, though, I was just

868
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,460
thinking that in in media recently, there is this instance of a bank failure.

869
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,160
And I don't know if if you paid any attention to it at all.

870
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,060
Five minutes was all I needed.

871
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,500
Yeah. Well, I was just curious about it because I was thinking to myself, it sounds

872
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,220
like you're describing what is actually unfolding there, regardless of what they're

873
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:49,100
explaining about it. It appears to me as though you're describing something that's

874
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,320
happening there with this bank, which is funny because, you know, on the one hand, the

875
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,880
perception is it's a small bank, which is not of any consequence.

876
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,520
And yet they're reporting it like worldwide.

877
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,740
Well, yes. Silicon Valley Bank.

878
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,320
Right. OK.

879
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,960
Do you know what hidden messages are?

880
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,200
And you know what? What is it called when they tell you something?

881
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,540
A preface is something that's going to come in the future.

882
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,960
Foreshadow. Right.

883
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,220
OK. But it's none of that.

884
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,200
It is and it isn't.

885
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,940
What they're trying to tell you in so many ways is this.

886
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,640
One, there is no money since 1933.

887
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,080
It's been the system has been done away with.

888
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,700
That's why, for example, you pull out a bank note.

889
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,000
It doesn't say Central Bank.

890
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,540
It says Federal Reserve System.

891
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,200
Doesn't say bank anywhere on the bank notes anywhere.

892
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,240
It's a system. You're way past banking.

893
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,980
There are no banks, I assure you.

894
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,760
Your bank is all all banking that's been done for the past 90 years has been done on

895
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,760
a temporary emergency fashion.

896
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,580
OK. I don't know how else to say that.

897
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,320
In a temporary emergency fashion would be like there's a disaster and the Red Cross

898
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,400
shows up and they put out some with their vans and they're folding tables and

899
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,940
they're rinsing off wounds and putting bandages on people.

900
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,180
Right. That's it. It's a temporary whatever, you know, like a I don't know, how would

901
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,520
you like you go to a set of a restaurant?

902
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,260
It's just somebody setting up a booth with a skillet out in the park and charging two

903
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,500
dollars for rice and beans.

904
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,100
It's a temporary kitchen, right?

905
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,760
It's a temporary situation.

906
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:30,060
None of those banks are, as a matter of fact, they're not even listed as banks, only

907
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,880
in name only. You could call anything a bank, like, for example, Federal Express.

908
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,520
Are they part of the federal government?

909
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,940
No, no. Can can you open federal hardware store?

910
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,960
I believe I can. Yeah, I can just call it that.

911
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,600
Yeah. Yeah. Is any people are going to discredit someone thinks part of the federal

912
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,380
government put a picture of George Washington?

913
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,980
Well, they got you fooled. OK.

914
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,180
Banks are not banks.

915
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,200
They're not corporations.

916
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,800
And they're not trusts.

917
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,220
What are they? It's very clear.

918
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:07,360
It's right on there. The main bank that's registered is an N.A., N dot A dot, which is

919
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:12,140
a national association, which a national association is.

920
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,700
Let me give you some other examples of national associations.

921
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,640
What category?

922
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,720
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Sierra Club are national associations.

923
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,940
You want to think of a few more.

924
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,080
There is just look up what is a national association and give me a list of them.

925
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,380
I'll repeat it. Sierra Club.

926
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,280
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts.

927
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,380
Now, why are they listed?

928
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,500
In the same category as the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts and Sierra Club, Wells Fargo City

929
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,640
Corp, all these banks, why are they listed like that?

930
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,680
You see what I'm I mean, I'm not going to give the why on that.

931
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,640
I know it's rated Y, but it's ridiculous.

932
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,540
Right now, you have other corporations, you have banks that have corporations using that

933
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,720
name for other purposes.

934
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,620
So you don't have any banks.

935
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,480
What they are is credit.

936
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,060
OK, here, you know, I think I've given the example if I minus a thousand dollars in my

937
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,080
checking account, can I write you a check for ten dollars?

938
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,460
No. If you gave me if someone gave me a thousand dollars now, remember, I was a minus a

939
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,720
thousand dollars. Can I still write a check for ten dollars?

940
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,980
The answer is no. No.

941
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,500
Let's say there's no fees.

942
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,360
Let's say. OK.

943
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:31,620
All right. So why is it that every government is able to pay government employees and send

944
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,640
out bonus checks or relief checks?

945
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,040
When if you go to their website, their treasury, they're all in trillions or hundreds of

946
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,820
billions in the minus. How can they do that?

947
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,680
How can they write your check for any of that?

948
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,200
Why am I the only one bringing up this simple third grader point or fourth?

949
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,260
What was it in the fourth or fifth grade in math class?

950
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,100
One day the teacher gets up.

951
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,420
I think you're a fifth or sixth grade.

952
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,980
And she says, this is how you write checks, boys and girls.

953
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,840
Do you remember that? Yeah, actually, I think it was fifth grade.

954
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,420
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

955
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,440
And nobody. OK, so you've been exposed to this since 10, 11 years old.

956
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,440
And how come no one is bringing this point up about economics here?

957
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,080
So where are they getting the money?

958
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,380
They're taking it from your signature when you go to a bank and say, do you give loans?

959
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:27,080
OK, if I'm pre-approved for a ten thousand dollar boat loan, will you show me what

960
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,800
account you get the money to give me the ten thousand?

961
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,560
No, they can't. None of them.

962
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,100
Right. I don't know if you've ever been to what's called a mortgage signing or a

963
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,120
promissory note signing.

964
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,240
Yeah. Yeah. You've been OK.

965
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:45,800
You've noticed that they come when the victim is ready to sign three, four of these

966
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,060
bankers are usually to come up and they cover all they cover all the paperwork with

967
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,400
blank paper except for where you're supposed to sign.

968
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,680
Yeah. Have you seen that?

969
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,520
And they're all like they're getting this dopamine rush.

970
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,740
OK, right. OK, give me an example.

971
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,580
And I want to dwell on this long, make this too long.

972
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:10,420
But I knew a guy who had a petrochemical company was selling it to the Germans for

973
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:15,100
50 million. And he says, hey, listen, the bank just called me.

974
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,640
I'm staying over there in Houston, Texas.

975
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,840
And actually, it was thirty six million for this one.

976
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,780
And the bank says they want me to come and sign a check.

977
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,180
And I said, wait a second, aren't you selling it to them and the sale is going

978
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,820
through? Aren't they supposed to send you money?

979
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,600
Yeah, that's what's supposed to happen.

980
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,820
But the bank, as a matter of fact, they called me up.

981
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,500
They said they want me to come in and sign a check.

982
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,540
And this is the third time I'm doing it.

983
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,460
And I'm like, oh, shit, I got to see this.

984
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,640
So we go to the bank and three of these jerk offs come around.

985
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,040
They're all like they're zombified eyes.

986
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,140
Well, this paperwork and they actually have a big check and they cover it with

987
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,000
paper. You can't see what it says on top.

988
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,920
And they have the guy sign it.

989
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,700
Why? Because the German bank doesn't have any money to send.

990
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,720
So in other words, when this man who is supposed to be receiving the funds from

991
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,940
another from the transaction is actually creating the funds with a signature

992
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,640
several times. I said, how many checks have you signed?

993
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,480
This will be the third time. Do you know that you just basically gave the bank a

994
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,700
hundred million, thirty six million times three hundred eight million.

995
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,600
And they're just going to give you three.

996
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,900
Are you looking at what's going on here?

997
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,440
Yeah. But, you know, I know what you're saying.

998
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,600
Greek is the truth.

999
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,820
And I know you know your stuff.

1000
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,140
But I never heard of that before.

1001
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,700
But now that I see it happening and I don't think anybody else knows this is

1002
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,300
happening, so I guess it's OK.

1003
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,060
Wow. That sounds crazy, doesn't it?

1004
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,300
This is the world you live in.

1005
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,060
Right. Well, yeah, I've seen this thing before where you sign a check and it never

1006
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,360
made any sense to me either.

1007
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,560
I never purchased a home myself, but I've seen and I say to myself, but you're

1008
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,000
getting a loan.

1009
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,340
Why are you signing a check?

1010
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,200
Right, well, the promissory note is different when you well, here's the other

1011
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,540
thing, let's just throw this in.

1012
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,480
If you have a deed of trust or more, it's different with every state, supposedly.

1013
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:19,120
But if you have a deed of trust, when you right before the sale happens, it says

1014
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,980
for consideration of ten dollars, you own the home fee simple.

1015
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,620
Fee simple means you have to give a fee to the king.

1016
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,560
That means you own it. But now you're going to give it in a mortgage.

1017
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:33,200
So you don't get a mortgage, you give a mortgage and you cannot give a mortgage

1018
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,780
for something that you don't already fully own.

1019
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:40,020
So what's really happening is that you fully own the house.

1020
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,420
But the and then you putting it into a mortgage, which you can't pay, you can't

1021
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,500
pay a mortgage, it's called you could satisfy a mortgage when you pay a mortgage.

1022
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,700
You don't pay it.

1023
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,880
You actually going on a contract, you're going to give so many payments and then

1024
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,880
they have to give you a letter of satisfaction because you can't there's no

1025
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:03,160
money to pay. So it's really, really a level of insanity.

1026
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,800
By the way, if you do have a deed of trust, read it.

1027
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,120
The first line on all of them says you own the house free, simple, but now you're

1028
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,680
going to put it into a mortgage because you're just a nice guy.

1029
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,580
We found a way to get out of that, by the way, I could tell you what it was.

1030
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,640
The mortgage contract and the deed of trust is a trust.

1031
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,520
You're making the mortgage, the people that are dealing, the mortgage company, the

1032
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,180
trustees and you're the trust store.

1033
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,340
You're full of command of it.

1034
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,680
Why don't you just being the trust or why don't you file a record in the public

1035
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,960
records that as the trust store of the trust, you're not happy with the trustee

1036
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,480
and you're firing them and appointing someone else like your dog and you just

1037
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:49,880
fire them because when you fire them and they have a legal notice, they can't come

1038
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,940
back and foreclose because they can only foreclose if they're an active trustee.

1039
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,580
So you fire them before that and just make someone else the trustee.

1040
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,980
Now, we had about 100 people do this around California and Arizona, and the

1041
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:07,220
district attorneys of those states physically went to the people's homes and

1042
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,920
asked them. They thought they were in trouble.

1043
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,880
And they asked them, you didn't do anything illegal, but we want to know who

1044
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,800
showed you this.

1045
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,120
But do you see how simple the rationale is?

1046
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,460
You are the trust store.

1047
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,360
The mortgage company is the trustee, the trust or can fire the trustee anytime and

1048
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,620
appoint another trustee.

1049
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,480
Right now, if someone's fired, can they come back and collect the paycheck, let's

1050
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,640
say, at a job? No, no, that's it.

1051
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,400
They're terminated. That's terminated.

1052
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,300
So so that's how you get rid of them.

1053
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,360
And it's so simple.

1054
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:46,440
And yeah, so, yeah, the banking situation, this is not going to change is going to

1055
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,440
get worse and worse with the digital currency.

1056
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,500
You know, with the digital currency, if you want to go and buy, let's say, potato

1057
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,300
chips and they decide that you shouldn't have potato chips that day, the sale won't

1058
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,060
go through. Right.

1059
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,500
You understand. Right.

1060
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,080
OK, so it's we've talked about this before, quote unquote, Mark of the Beast

1061
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,060
thing. You won't be able to buy or sell.

1062
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,500
It's a roundabout.

1063
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,340
It's not the mark of the beast, but it's a roundabout way precursor to it.

1064
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,060
Well, it's a control. It's very much like what they do with the.

1065
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,720
You know, with the Department of Agriculture credits, which are actually, you know, what

1066
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,140
they call food stamps, right, or still call food stamps, even though there's no

1067
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,060
stamps anymore.

1068
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,720
EBT card.

1069
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:35,420
EBT, right. So the thing is, the Department of Agriculture issues a credit and that

1070
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,620
credit can only be used for what it is meant to purchase.

1071
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:45,000
Right. So you can't go buy cigarettes with it, say, you know, technically directly.

1072
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,100
Right. Right.

1073
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,620
It's very similar to that. Very much so.

1074
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,900
Yeah. But, you know, the people that use those, the people are commented on by those

1075
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,840
that those that don't use them say, oh, they're living off the dole of enough for

1076
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,220
taxpayer dollars. No, they're not.

1077
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,320
When you have an EBT card, the moment you sign for it, those funds are created on the

1078
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,440
spot through J.P.

1079
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,460
Morgan. It's right on the card.

1080
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,220
It says this is all administered by J.P.

1081
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,520
Morgan. Your signature is where they're getting it from.

1082
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,060
And that's from the gold clause.

1083
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,640
Right. When they took in the gold to print bank notes.

1084
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,560
OK, how did they bankrupt the U.S.?

1085
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,320
Real quick. They 16th Amendment Federal Reserve gets invited.

1086
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,960
So they have elastic currency.

1087
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,200
You know what? Elastic currency is a rubber check.

1088
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,060
Right. Elastic.

1089
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,600
Get it. Currency checks because their notes and rubber check, by the way, most young

1090
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,760
people don't know it. But years ago, if you said I got a rubber check, that was a bad

1091
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,880
thing. So basically, they're telling you that we're going to have a private

1092
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,260
organization do the money for us and 16th Amendment, which wasn't ratified properly.

1093
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,960
But it doesn't matter because Congress hasn't really been in lawful session since

1094
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,140
1861 when the Civil War started.

1095
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,060
There was a quote is there's a Latin term for means dead on arrival.

1096
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,720
Whatever that term is, it is what they put in their books.

1097
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,440
So they still meet formally twice a year or whatever it is, Congress and Senate.

1098
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,220
But it has no lawful effect since 1861.

1099
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,780
You could look this up.

1100
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,960
All right. Well, anyway, what happened was they bring the Federal Reserve in and they

1101
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,180
said, you give us your gold and silver and we'll print notes at a rate of six

1102
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:25,920
percent. OK, so as they're continuously giving the Federal Reserve the gold.

1103
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,100
And the silver, they're printing bank notes, which do say redeemable and silver.

1104
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,900
I think you sent me one once, Chuck, a couple of years ago.

1105
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:40,120
Right. OK, well, the problem they forgot, which a ninth nine year old could figure

1106
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,480
out, is that what happens when you give them all your gold and all your silver?

1107
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,960
You still owe them six percent, don't you?

1108
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,500
Yeah. Are you going to pay that now?

1109
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,680
Right. So that's what the bankruptcy of 1933 was.

1110
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,820
By the way, if you go in 1933 newspaper articles, there make no bones about it.

1111
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,740
You could look it up right now.

1112
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,760
Newspaper articles from 1933 front page or articles is saying, oh, yeah, Federal

1113
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,260
Reserve just shipped 80 million dollars worth of gold bullion off to France from

1114
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,700
the U.S. left this morning.

1115
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,120
They're shipping it all back to Europe.

1116
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,340
There's nothing in Fort Knox, by the way, or anyway.

1117
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,300
So this is how it was. So by 19, they had the Banking Act.

1118
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,140
The Depression was completely fake, which was admitted to by Bernanke, by the way.

1119
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,940
Do you remember Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman?

1120
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,520
He did a public speech that lasted about two minutes apologizing for putting the

1121
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,660
U.S. into the Depression.

1122
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,820
Right. It was totally orchestrated.

1123
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:44,920
OK. By the way, if you're this dumb, meaning the population, you deserve this, by

1124
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:51,060
the way. I don't know if that from Greek, from the Greeks point of view, if you're

1125
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:55,500
so freaking stupid and dumb and ignorant, you deserve what's coming to you.

1126
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,000
Right. You deserve that kind of treatment.

1127
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,520
So I'm not I'm not this is not a sympathy call here.

1128
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,980
Right. I'm just talking about the collective.

1129
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,200
They deserve everything and worse, actually, which they're going to get in the

1130
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,300
future. But so so this is what's going on.

1131
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,000
It's very, very much out in the open.

1132
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,580
And that's the short of it.

1133
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,000
This happened with every country.

1134
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,280
Other countries are slightly different because their money laws, if you had a

1135
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,580
Napoleonic style law, it worked a little different, but generally the same.

1136
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,260
Right. You know, a lot of countries, by the way, were running under Napoleonic law.

1137
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:33,820
Right. So anyway, that's that's all I got to say about that.

1138
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,500
That's my story. And I'm sticking to it.

1139
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:41,340
There you go. How much how much further can you go with it once you get to that point

1140
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:45,980
where, you know, look, if you're dumb enough to accept this, then you kind of deserve

1141
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:54,420
it. So but it's interesting because I don't think anybody talks about how these

1142
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,900
things were publicly admitted to.

1143
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,320
And then just, OK, now we continue on, you know, like that receivership, the pizza

1144
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,840
place is still there, you know.

1145
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,540
Yeah, the state is there. That's why they said earlier, state of Georgia is not

1146
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:15,560
Georgia state. Georgia state is what you see on the map and everything that part of

1147
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:20,600
it. State of Georgia is the corporation that manages it.

1148
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,979
I was telling someone yesterday when, OK, all this anti-police stuff, right.

1149
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,500
OK, where did the history of the police?

1150
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,640
They came out in the mid 19th century.

1151
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:35,760
They started in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland.

1152
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,140
Right. And then it's why?

1153
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:43,580
Because those large cities got involved with private bankers, Rothschild types,

1154
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:46,920
Rockefeller types. There were no Rockefellers then, but sort of.

1155
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,040
And they mortgaged City Hall and they more most of when it reached to the point where

1156
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,720
one third of the entire city was mortgaged out to these private bankers.

1157
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:01,560
The private bankers came to the state or the city and said, hey, look, we pretty much

1158
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,140
own most of your property here or half of the property that's worth owning.

1159
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,880
What if something happens like a riot or crime or whatever?

1160
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,020
Are you able to protect it?

1161
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:13,120
And they're like, no. All right.

1162
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,960
So why don't we start what's called a police department?

1163
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,560
Right. To protect our property.

1164
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:23,000
You get it. So that's where the police come from.

1165
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:27,520
So whenever you see police, they represent the private bankers.

1166
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:33,680
That pretty much bankrupted or our own City Hall and all the important stuff in that

1167
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,140
city, that's why the police have you know, they have to stay within city borders

1168
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,279
usually. Right. Right.

1169
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:44,319
OK, now the sheriff is no better because he's working on the state level.

1170
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,260
Right. And then you have federal marshals and they're no better, too, because the

1171
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,960
Fed, the 1933 March the 9th is all about the federal government going bankrupt.

1172
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,340
So they're working for the banks, too.

1173
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,380
That's what the marshals were about, by the way.

1174
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,780
Texas Rangers were different.

1175
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,840
They were lawful. So all this history.

1176
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,820
So in short, a lot does a lawful society that uses lawful money have police?

1177
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,660
No, there is no police present whatsoever.

1178
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,620
So whenever you see a police department somewhere, that means that you're pretty

1179
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:18,420
much bankrupt under the pirate threat through to the private bankers through banking

1180
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:23,140
acts. Well, and they're they're there to enforce policy, which is what the name

1181
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,920
sounds. Sure. Sure.

1182
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,040
The policy is to protect and serve usually.

1183
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,980
And they were put there.

1184
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:34,000
By the way, this is something that 99 percent of the people ever told us to had never

1185
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,700
heard of it. But when they do like a cursory research, they find it to be 100 percent

1186
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:46,840
true. So, you know, anybody could be hired by them, by the way, you know, in order to

1187
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,680
be hired by the police, you have to be you can't be too smart.

1188
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,400
Right. This is very well known.

1189
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,380
The same with politicians.

1190
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,700
Oh, yeah. Whatever. Military also.

1191
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,980
So we're pretty much whatever in that conditions.

1192
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,560
So I'm not anti police.

1193
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
I'm anti what brought that on.

1194
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,960
Right. So whatever.

1195
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:16,820
Well, now, look, the idea that someone should keep order, I guess in a lawful society,

1196
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,940
you don't require anybody to keep order because it's already orderly.

1197
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,840
Well, who's keeping order and for why?

1198
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:27,300
Like I just said, the police were set up because the private bankers already took over

1199
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,080
most of the important parts of the city and they put them in there to protect their

1200
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,480
private interests, because let's say the bankers own City Hall through private

1201
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,020
agreements and most of the important properties and there's a riot and the riot

1202
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,060
results in the destruction of those properties.

1203
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,760
When the property is destroyed, what's its value?

1204
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,220
Compared to what it was before it was destroyed, you see my point, they don't care

1205
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,620
about order and they want to maintain the property value.

1206
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,280
Right. You see what I mean?

1207
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
All right. So, OK, thanks for bringing the here.

1208
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,280
Here. This just brought us a new it sprouted a new moment.

1209
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,480
OK, the police are there to maintain property value, period.

1210
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,740
That's it. Think about it.

1211
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,660
All right. When you're in the ghetto and there's a shootout, what's the police

1212
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,880
response? Never.

1213
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,440
They never come. Right.

1214
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,980
Maybe in three hours.

1215
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:23,240
Right. If you're in a wealthy neighborhood, Golden Ghetto, there's a shootout.

1216
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,520
The police are like they were like dropped out of the sky.

1217
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,840
They're there in three minutes.

1218
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,740
Right. Right.

1219
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,180
Fifteen cars for one gun.

1220
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,320
But if you're in a ghetto, really, you know, they're not coming.

1221
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,400
They're not coming. Right.

1222
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,360
They're not coming or it's like two hours.

1223
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,140
They show up to clean up after.

1224
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,040
There's a mop up crew for you because that's about what they come to do.

1225
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,980
Yeah. Usually the ambulance shows up before the cops.

1226
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,080
And I've seen the ambulance circles around and leaves.

1227
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,840
Are the police here yet? No, they leave.

1228
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,560
They wait for the police to come before the ambulance shows up.

1229
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,600
Right. Somebody's got to protect them.

1230
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,240
Mm hmm. Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1231
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,700
So, yeah, you see what we got out of all this talk here?

1232
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,320
The police are there to maintain property value, period.

1233
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,220
By the way, I've had that conversation, this type of conversation with people

1234
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:13,080
that work as retired judges, city comptrollers.

1235
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:18,320
I used to have lunch years ago on a weekly basis with the basically the fiscal

1236
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,560
manager of the city that I live in.

1237
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,720
We on a weekly basis, actually her husband.

1238
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,620
OK. Right.

1239
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,900
And I was on a call yesterday that brought up that I was recommended

1240
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:35,280
by Catherine Austin Fitz as someone that, you know, to come for legal information

1241
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,180
and financial information on the working of the system.

1242
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,540
And I was like, oh, my gosh, you know.

1243
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,420
So there's an interesting point.

1244
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,580
So, look, you know, you've gone around a whole bunch of different subjects

1245
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,680
which are interconnected.

1246
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,360
We didn't really discuss the gods at all.

1247
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:53,880
But yet.

1248
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,420
Yet. Right.

1249
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,700
We all know this is important.

1250
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,360
This is important. Oh, no, no.

1251
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,860
I'm not saying any of this isn't important.

1252
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,300
This is very important. All of this is necessary.

1253
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,900
You know, and the the mosaic, I like to think of it as a mosaic.

1254
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,560
You know, you assemble something piece by piece and is being assembled here.

1255
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:18,520
And I like the way it's going for sure, because I'm actually learning and

1256
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,180
contemplating new things, even though I've heard some of this before, to be

1257
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:22,780
honest with you.

1258
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,740
But but now you're fitting some pieces together differently

1259
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,260
than than you had before.

1260
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,640
Maybe that's how I'm going to get to the why eventually.

1261
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,400
Right. Because it's going to make a lot more sense.

1262
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,340
But no, the gods, I think we're going to have to reserve for another day,

1263
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,380
you know, because because we've gone through a lot here and definitely talked

1264
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,940
about the the the system in general, how it really works

1265
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,120
versus how it's been represented, whether it's in the media or by the labels

1266
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,660
or, you know, here's the government assignment that they give you and what is

1267
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:03,140
actually going on receivership.

1268
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:06,100
There's a concept to wrap your mind around if you haven't already.

1269
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,320
What do you think the general idea here with this particular presentation is,

1270
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,720
though? I mean, I'm trying to come up with a it's definitely

1271
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,840
part of it, but easy.

1272
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,140
Yeah, good. Easy. We got to tie the gods into it real quick.

1273
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,040
When you talk about the gods, the way they relate to humans, they know all this is

1274
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,060
going on, by the way.

1275
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:32,080
What the gods did is they set this up as a human terrarium.

1276
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,540
You know, a terrarium is where you set up a condition.

1277
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:39,380
You put plants and animals that one feeds off the other so you don't have to keep

1278
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,980
watering and feeding it every day.

1279
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,320
You pretty much set up a balanced ecosystem.

1280
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,040
You close it. You look at it.

1281
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,140
You don't have to interact with it that much.

1282
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,560
We're in a terrarium. All of these things are set to go for a certain amount of

1283
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,960
years or quote unquote ages, and they have to run through.

1284
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,560
Right. So the key point was setting up a terrarium.

1285
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,180
One thing feeds off of another.

1286
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:08,060
Right. I think the banking talk and all this stuff that I was talking about is

1287
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,700
showing clearly how that's happening.

1288
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,320
One thing feeding off of another.

1289
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,540
Right. So this is how the gods have set it up.

1290
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,580
And like I've said, just to finish this, how do you set it up there?

1291
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,280
The gods, first of all, they're not your friends.

1292
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,420
They don't like you.

1293
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:26,280
They they've set you up this way, but they also know nothing bad.

1294
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,320
Ultimately, on the on the highest level, nothing bad could ultimately come to you.

1295
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,860
No matter how bad it seems here, you're going to be OK.

1296
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,040
You're in an intermediate.

1297
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,000
They set up humanity to be in an intermediate point.

1298
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,060
An intermediate point is like you've heard of spring cleaning, like a really good

1299
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,580
spring cleaning. You take a day off, you take all the furniture out of the house,

1300
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,900
you dust everything, you throw away all this stuff that you don't you don't think

1301
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,820
you're going to use. You probably take everything out of the closet.

1302
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,120
Maybe you don't. I do. And I wash everything again, even though it hasn't been

1303
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,480
worn. Right.

1304
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,640
The spring cleaning.

1305
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,840
Right. So we're in like this spring cleaning part of humanity and slip in going

1306
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,220
on for six thousand years.

1307
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:12,420
It started off with a bang and it's going to end with a bang, which is not too far

1308
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:16,900
away. So in essence, you

1309
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:21,280
have, by the way, you have everything you need to answer prayers and to manifest

1310
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,180
things. That's why I keep saying they're not listening to your prayers.

1311
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,600
You know, I mean, what does it mean?

1312
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,500
Indefinitely, none of the gods are going to help or listen to you.

1313
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,960
Prayers. But in general, no, they don't listen because you have they've already

1314
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,660
given you everything. Kind of like you ever see an experiment where they put a monkey

1315
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:44,340
in a cage with different objects and they put the banana in a box

1316
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,520
and in order to get into the box, you need a key and they put the key off to the

1317
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,080
side. And there's a whole bunch of people watching him.

1318
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,660
He wants to get the he smells a banana.

1319
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,780
He wants to get in there. And he goes over to where there's a row of different

1320
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,020
objects, the keys in the middle.

1321
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:02,120
And he picks up the object right next to the key.

1322
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,740
And everybody, the scientists outside are yelling at him.

1323
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,240
No, no, no. Put that down.

1324
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,780
Put pick up the key.

1325
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,840
The key will do it. And the monkey looks at him kind of bewildered and then goes to

1326
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,560
even further away from the key.

1327
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,160
You're like, oh, shit, this is kind of dumb.

1328
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:23,680
They're not going to. The scientist is not going to go into the cage and pick up the

1329
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,000
key and give it to the monkey and show him how to open the box.

1330
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,860
Right. You see my analogy here?

1331
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. OK.

1332
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,380
In other words, everything is already here.

1333
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,740
It's a matter of if you must find it.

1334
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:38,280
This is mentioned in Scripture, the biblical text many, many, many times.

1335
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,380
They'll say that if you read in the King James, the Lord hides things.

1336
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,920
So the sovereigns are meaning the higher ups of the world will find them.

1337
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,600
Right. All these things are hidden.

1338
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:55,060
It talks. There's over maybe 50 references to how what we need is hidden here.

1339
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,280
Right. Right.

1340
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,000
So and if you're going to pray, you have to pray properly.

1341
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:06,280
It gives you instructions on like how they do in church and all this other religious

1342
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,320
God. That's the opposite.

1343
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:13,340
Look, and to finish it off, whether you're talking about the Bible or the news or

1344
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:19,320
whatever, any organization that picked up a body of work, in other words, if you

1345
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,620
look at the newspaper and they're presenting, whether it's written or video, you

1346
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,520
know what the television show they call the news, either way, you know what they're

1347
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,320
going to report to the public is exactly opposite of what the journalist brought to

1348
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,500
them. Informate the investigative journalist found it's going to be completely

1349
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:44,000
reversed. That's why I tell people, listen, I find the mainstream media to be very

1350
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,600
accurate diametrically.

1351
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:48,660
So whatever they tell you, it's the opposite.

1352
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,760
So if they say it was a terrorist attack, it means it wasn't a terrorist attack quite

1353
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,400
accurately. Right.

1354
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,060
You see, the general scope is very accurate.

1355
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,360
So whatever they say.

1356
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,980
So if they say there is a bank crash, that means there wasn't a bank crash.

1357
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,020
You see, you see what I mean?

1358
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,720
So they're actually if you look at the opposite of what they're telling you, it was

1359
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,240
a pandemic. That means there was no pandemic.

1360
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:19,800
It was a biological, chemical, energetic attack.

1361
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,960
Right. We'll get into that in the future on how people, let's say, and during the

1362
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:30,180
pandemic, they're at a here in Tucson and witnesses, they're at a convention, the

1363
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:33,340
jewelry, the mineral show, one of the biggest mineral shows in the world.

1364
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,520
Actually, it is the biggest mineral show in the world in February, a month before

1365
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:44,060
they declared people were some were experiencing flu like symptoms and haziness

1366
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:45,740
of thought. And they would fall out.

1367
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:47,720
A lot of them died, by the way, couldn't breathe.

1368
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,100
Guess what they did about two days before.

1369
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,960
All these symptoms were reported at the gem show, they turned on about six or seven

1370
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:06,290
5G towers in that neighborhood, these people had the initial doctor reports was

1371
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:11,570
radiation poisoning, by the way, other parts of the country.

1372
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:18,210
It was biochemical attack, different symptoms, right on and on and on and on.

1373
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:23,730
So it was energetic weapon, biochemical and other places.

1374
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:28,250
It was just the hospitals being incentivized to murder people, put someone on a

1375
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,270
ventilator, you sedate them, don't give them water, don't give them food for a week.

1376
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:34,110
What's going to happen? Yeah, of course.

1377
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:38,030
Right. So it was like a three or four prong thing.

1378
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,850
So was it a pandemic?

1379
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,870
Absolutely not.

1380
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,610
Did a lot of people die in several ways that they look like they got sick and in

1381
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,850
hospitals? Yes, absolutely.

1382
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:47,850
No. Here's the thing.

1383
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:51,410
Find out if anyone died outside of a hospital from the covid thing.

1384
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:55,310
Nobody. The only ones that died outside of the hospital were the ones that were hit

1385
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,390
with energetic weapons.

1386
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:01,370
It's pretty easy to do, by the way, which one day we'll talk about that.

1387
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:06,270
Well, I think in part two, there was just there is a natural cycle, it seems to me,

1388
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,550
as though, you know, illness does spread over certain time periods.

1389
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,930
It's just naturally unnatural.

1390
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:18,130
In other words, there's a curse that's been known in ancient times that if you are

1391
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:24,870
extremely let me just say this again, extremely sexually promiscuous, the gods

1392
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:27,990
don't like that and they will smite you with some kind of disease.

1393
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:31,550
This is what I just said has been written since the ancient Sumerian times.

1394
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,070
This is not a Christian thing.

1395
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,050
This is not. OK, let me repeat that.

1396
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:42,450
If you're extremely sexually promiscuous for a long enough period of time, you will

1397
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,210
get some kind of a disease where your groin will rot off.

1398
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,750
This has been known since the beginning of time.

1399
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,200
You see what I mean? I don't think I've ever seen.

1400
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,460
I'm not saying sex does that.

1401
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:58,300
I'm saying, you know, I'm just thinking to myself, I don't think I've ever known

1402
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,360
anybody whose groin is actually rotted off.

1403
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,640
Well, it's an example.

1404
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,920
Yeah, but I heard it hurts when it years ago used to be called the clap.

1405
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,760
Right. Oh, yeah.

1406
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,880
No, that. But, you know, the truth is, I haven't known anybody who's caught that in

1407
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,340
a while. At least I don't know.

1408
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,800
That's right. It's a it's a hygiene thing.

1409
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,260
But, you know, there is there isn't no there's no natural disease.

1410
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:21,860
But if you do things really wrong, like, for example, if you naturally drink a bottle

1411
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:25,740
of scotch every day, your liver is going to dry up and kill you.

1412
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,520
Right. Naturally.

1413
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,460
Right. Yeah.

1414
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,940
Because the scotch is pretty natural.

1415
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,720
Your liver is pretty natural.

1416
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,500
Can you say you die to natural causes?

1417
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,780
Of course. Yeah.

1418
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,880
So is your behavior within that natural world that leads to disease?

1419
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,300
You see what I mean? Yeah, of course.

1420
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,100
What behavior you choose.

1421
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,580
Yeah, yeah, no, I got you.

1422
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,260
So it's about behavior and the answer to that.

1423
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,040
Of course. Yeah.

1424
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,780
Yeah. And it could be weaponized.

1425
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,520
You know, there there is a way to create a plague or a disease.

1426
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,920
It's not in the lab. If you took the worst bio.

1427
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:04,740
By the way, there are there are publications, if you could find them now that I've

1428
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:09,560
looked at where they had actually found like the worst diseases in the world, people

1429
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,480
with them, especially the Japanese, did a lot of study on this, mainly the Japanese,

1430
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:20,040
the Americans, the Germans, the Swiss, the Swedish, that that part of the world.

1431
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:24,860
They have tons and tons of reference books where let's say you pick any bad disease,

1432
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:30,640
anything right. They would take blood and lymph fluid, saliva, urine and share it with

1433
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,600
someone who did not have the disease and they wouldn't catch it.

1434
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:37,340
Never, never, never, never, ever.

1435
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:44,160
But when there were certain people in proximity would get the disease, go figure.

1436
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,900
Right. Amazing.

1437
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:50,920
And also when the people were sick, let's say you had three people that were categorized

1438
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,260
as having the bubonic plague.

1439
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:57,540
They would take the blood lymphatic fluid, urine, feces, stool and study it, catalog

1440
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,720
everything they saw. Then the person next to them with the identical diagnosis, they

1441
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:08,380
would look at their blood, lymph fluid, feces, urine and they would look and catalog

1442
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,200
everything in there and they didn't match.

1443
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,100
So there's nothing biological.

1444
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:20,180
They'll tell you, obviously, 19 Arab hijackers vaporized the World Trade Center with

1445
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:21,320
box cutters. Right.

1446
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,940
That sounds pretty plausible if you're retarded.

1447
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,160
Yeah, it's the same thing.

1448
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,080
It has to be done the same way.

1449
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,240
Excuse me. Drink coffee and talk at the same time.

1450
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,220
Not advisable. It has to be done the same way.

1451
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,920
When you look at a cross section of the human intestine and a cross section of a car

1452
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,540
tire, how nothing penetrates structurally.

1453
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,620
I was talking to someone recently about this.

1454
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,720
So one holds a high pressure air.

1455
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,160
How could. Well, exactly.

1456
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:55,140
The car tire is designed to have maintain a very high pressure differential from what's

1457
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,380
inside the tire to outside.

1458
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,540
If you look at the human intestine, it's exactly the same thing.

1459
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,360
But the pressures are not that high.

1460
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,760
Nothing passes through that.

1461
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,680
So it has to be through induction.

1462
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,240
So the way disease is transmuted back in the old days was by induction.

1463
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,060
And we can get I don't know if I get I don't know.

1464
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:18,420
There's very few people that are able to speak on this, how to create a plague.

1465
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,840
It's not it's not that easy.

1466
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,040
What I'm trying to say is you can go in the laboratory, like I gave the example earlier,

1467
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,500
taking samples for the sickest people or even ones that are not sick that you think are

1468
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:35,240
going to be sick. You could put that in a laboratory, freeze it and then put it in the

1469
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,760
water or spray it on people.

1470
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:42,760
A few people might get sick a little bit, but it won't turn into a pandemic.

1471
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:48,840
I assure you that for sure, that the way you create a pandemic is by the way the human

1472
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,200
body works, by induction.

1473
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,400
And we'll leave that for another day, but I'll give you a hint.

1474
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,200
It's going to require at least 30 to 100 people and it's going to take about two to three

1475
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,620
months to do it. And I could lay it out, lay out exactly how it's done historically,

1476
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,660
but not in the sonic.

1477
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,760
And also, I don't know if it's a good idea to do that.

1478
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,620
Well, yeah, fair enough.

1479
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,900
And look, again, we've been through a great many subjects and sort of laid out the

1480
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:22,480
symptoms of what is what is happening here is still and only just slightly touched on

1481
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:29,460
the gods and their role in this, which, again, I'm always amazed at the people that, you

1482
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,660
know, try and tell you that, you know, God loves you and this.

1483
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,000
No, there is. There is one.

1484
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,240
But that one can't help you very much, can he?

1485
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,200
Well, that's that's the thing, you know.

1486
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,360
Look, did you hear that Vinny Short, Vinny Eastwood thing I did?

1487
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,420
I heard one of it. Yeah.

1488
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,820
Because, you know, Vinny, Vinny glazes over when you get into any of these subjects.

1489
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,820
Right. I mean, I love Vinny for whatever, but I got to just say it as I see it.

1490
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,460
Right. So when I saw him glazing over, I said, OK, you know what?

1491
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:58,380
There are many gods, but there's only one of you.

1492
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,160
Think about that.

1493
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,500
Now, fair enough.

1494
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:12,460
So, you know, I'm just I'm just thinking about how to wrap this all up, actually.

1495
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:14,740
And it's a wrap.

1496
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,860
That's it. Pretty much.

1497
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,660
There you go. Let's just say we're.

1498
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,840
Yeah, let's just say we'll put a bow on it.

1499
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,020
And until the next one, number seven.

1500
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:23,560
There you have it.
