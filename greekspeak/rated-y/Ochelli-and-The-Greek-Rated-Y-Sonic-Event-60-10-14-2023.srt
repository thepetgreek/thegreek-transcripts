1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:18,600
6060. That's the sonic event for this one rated Y recording. Okay. Anyway, Greek first

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,620
off, how you doing tonight?

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,100
I'm doing all right.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,660
All right. And I do say night because I mean, it is dark where I am. So I call that night.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:46,680
Yeah, certainly the day did begin at solar noon. I was up doing some other things before that, but doesn't matter what I do. Let's get into the discussions in the chat, right? Let's address those because that's been rather fascinating. Lately, you also got an email, which you might talk about later, or maybe not.

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:01:15,640
Well, it's an email that you forwarded. I usually get frequent emails. Fortunately, I've put out conditions and how I like to get emails. And those have been met. I don't get too many emails saying you've got talk about your stuff is great. Don't send me an email like that. Because I know it's great. Sounds cocky. But whatever. But yeah, stuff that can engage what the conversation had been about, add or take

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,620
away. If it furthers the conversation, then it's worth sending to the Greeks email address. That's that simple.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,560
Uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com. That's numeric one. uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com. Right?

9
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:59,780
Right. But also, if you do wind up sending them to me, I do filter them down to what I think would be worthy of response as well, based on the same criteria most of the time. Although I will address certain questions. If they've got like one random question in there with a bunch of other things. I'll boil it down for you. So it's easier. Anyway, I like the chat room, though, because we get a lot of interesting back and forth in real time conversations between people that are listening. So very helpful.

10
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:09,000
And if you want to go and check that out, it's easy to find a fairly decent chat tango thing. I know it's a little antiquated, but it's accessible to everybody.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:28,080
And also, there are very few people that are active in there compared to how many subs there are, which are still very few. But yeah, it's even fewer on the chat. But it's still I think gives a I don't know, wouldn't be right safe cross sectional view of what's going on. But it's the best we have. And it is appreciated,

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:53,240
though they are growing. And just one final little housekeeping note here, you do want to get over to the Patreon. Okay, which is Patreon, patreon.com and slash Greek speak, except when you spell speak, you got to spell it with two E's. All right. So if you go there, that's how you got to sign up now. All right. My signup should be disabled at my website. If somebody figures out how to sign up anyway, we'll sort it out. But

13
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:23,060
hopefully you have a banner there telling them where to go being disabled. Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay. All right. Oh, I didn't take anything for granted anymore. No, you can't. But but there's a clickable link there. If you go to the site, you see you can click here to subscribe. It'll take you to that Patreon link. Anyway, all the housekeeping out of the way, let's get to what it is they had to say. In the chat, shifting maze or PKD. Okay. postulate instead of Mandela effect. All right. You know,

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:37,800
because we brought up the Mandela effect a few times recently. Um, I think the idea of a shifting maze, because obviously, if things are altered in the reality, however, you think the mechanism works, I think it's a fair thing to say. Yeah, it's more

15
00:03:37,800 --> 00:04:07,460
with perception, perception is changing. Nothing is really changing. Because nothing can truly be objectified. I talked about trying to objectify and objectifying but you cannot truly objectify. A quick example is you know, infinity. It's usually a mathematical concept and it's numbers going out and you know, into where they might terminate and they won't terminate according to the rules of math. That's called

16
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:37,360
infinity. Right. But that whole process of doing that sitting down and doing that is within another reality that is not mathematical, which also has its infinity, you see. So it's like the Chinese dolls. And it's also like, when you do perspective drawings, you have a vanishing point, you know, the further away, you know, the right, the vanishing point, you know, you all lines go to one point. Yeah. So that shows that our perception is basically has rules to it. And the rules show that the perception is purely subjective.

17
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:55,660
Right. Same thing with photography, by the way, the vanishing points in photography. I mean, here's the thing, you can only capture so much within the photograph, because there is a limitation based on the amount that can be seen and absorbed into the data that is then represented in the photograph. Same, same concept, but photograph.

18
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:25,200
Okay, the Mandela effect and the other stuff, too, is just a signal from those that are operating in a higher look, if you're a fish in someone's living rooms, aquarium, and they're constantly changing the background, little plastic rocks, you know, they go to the stove and buy some more background, they pull the other ones out, drop them in. And all the fish are wondering what's going on is what is it a wonder about wonder about, right? Well, you know, tired of your ass, I'm gonna flush you down the toilet, right? And so they do that with fish.

19
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:34,020
Well, there's that plus, look, you know, according to that fish, look, everywhere I go, there's water. Not necessarily this.

20
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,840
Yeah, they are. Yeah, you'll have a philosopher fish comes out says, Hey, guys, I think we're in water. And they all laugh at him, right?

21
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:52,940
Yeah, well, but there you have it. And people have used that to try and explain many things. But okay, fair enough. Um, somebody asked about the percentage of peroxide when creating a, you know, the spray bottle, which is one of the most

22
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:09,780
don't dilute, don't mess with peroxide. The reason it comes in a darkened bottle is because light will dilute it just photo theresis or photo various photo reactions. It's very photo reactive. Actually, there are many photo reactive things in nature. That's how

23
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:25,960
that's how photography was first discovered by, you know, people drawing things out and leaves and things cover part of it. And as it dried, it changed, you know, change tone or color. Right? So they figured they could light has an effect and they found things that rapidly affected.

24
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Also, why, you know, beer bottles used to be brown for that.

25
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:55,940
Yeah, the quality. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There is a big quality change. Yeah. So so diluting it with water really, really changes it. And yeah, it'll still have the properties, but in a few days. Yeah, so. So what the key is to get the right dilution from the beginning. So the ones you buy at the stove, you know, the brown bottle at wherever you get, typically, whatever percentage it is, is a very, very mild solution. Then it jumps up to medium and

26
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:25,880
very strong solutions, which I don't recommend getting because that's getting stronger, it's rocket fuel. And also, if you combine, I've seen it even with the diluted, you know, pharmacy convenience store type hydrogen peroxide, if you have organic material, certain organic material will catch fire with hydrogen peroxide, because it's an oxidizer. Right? And chemically, and in physics, fire is considered an oxidizer. So when you burn wood, it's actually oxidized, by the way.

27
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:47,780
So aggressive oxygen, but don't mess with the proxy, get the dilution. And I don't qualify quantify too much, because I presume that most people are just going to go to a store, grocery store, whatever, whatever, and see hydrogen peroxide and those bottles on the shelf for about a buck or something. And that's the very dilute, fine, just use it just like it is.

28
00:07:47,780 --> 00:08:04,920
Right? Yeah, no reason to mess with that. There are other things that you did suggest diluting some and those were more like the detergents and say, stuff to wash your dishes, which makes sense, actually. And it makes it a lot more efficient and saves you some money to practicality there.

29
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:34,900
Well, it's already here's the thing, when you go get a big jug of laundry soap, the liquid, let's say even the powder, but let's say the liquid, let's say you get a gallon size of laundry soap, right? Right. For washing clothes, it's usually like a thick syrupy, you know, blue or green or whatever clear color. Most of that 99% of it is filler, only 1% or less is actual detergent. Because if they actually sold you just the detergent in a little tiny bottle, that was enough to do 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

30
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:34,320

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,260
million,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

33
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,060
was sitting there and it was in Japanese Americans English subtitles and you're

34
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,320
saying yeah I wanted to buy the rice that I sell you but I didn't want to sell

35
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,840
it to them because why would you sell someone rice that they can't cook so I

36
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,120
don't know how to cook but what does that mean if you sell someone rice that

37
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,360
they don't know how to cook it won't come out well and they'll say it's your

38
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,320
fault for selling me bad rice no rice was excellent just you can't cook it

39
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,020
right sure right and I've given an analogy on this with quote-unquote white

40
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,700
people in vegan food I found that the most delicious food I've ever eaten was

41
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,660
vegan food prepared I think I mentioned this by the Krishna's Thompson Square

42
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,860
Park on Avenue a they pull up with their school bus and absolutely yes they they

43
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,540
will sit there and if you show up and you hang out with them for a little bit

44
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,660
there they're more than happy to give you a food yeah they put out these

45
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,640
tables and that wonderful rice basmati with coconut and all these dishes are

46
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,620
just cardamom and just delicious vegetarian food so then I started

47
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,880
running into places and veganism became popular talk about late 80s early 90s in

48
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,540
New York it seems like the rest of the country's 10-20 years behind these

49
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,580
things right so always yeah we see it about a decade or two ahead in New York

50
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,180
City if it's something like this oh so I went over to someone's house and I think

51
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,100
they were like the local weed dealer or whatever and they're having dinner and

52
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,540
so we'd have dinner it's vegan and I'm like oh yeah vegan foods delicious it was

53
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,740
terrible it was terrible she's like oh I said this isn't really prepared she

54
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,360
goes oh because it's vegan no I was like no no you suck at cooking yeah

55
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,820
that's what it is you just decided to vegan so you get away with your shitty

56
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,740
cooking and just telling everyone is vegan that's why it doesn't taste good

57
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,600
no you need to stop what you're doing and learn how to cook or just stop cooking

58
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,800
and I've said this many times the person in the house that has the best sense of

59
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,400
smell and the best sense of taste not grandma or mom needs to do the cooking

60
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,300
and in most cases unfortunately it's going to happen it's going to be the dog

61
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,020
but anyway does have a better sense of smell taste yeah so you don't want the

62
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,600
dog cooking but next up from the dog next in line who has the best and by the

63
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
way find who you could be living in a group with roommates too I'm not talking

64
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,180
so when I say family I mean gather group you know community whatever enclave

65
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,220
people and the dog is no good because look an opposable thumb is necessary I

66
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,720
mean the fur gets in the way and all that so or hair so so what I'm suggesting

67
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,360
here is this is highly measurable in other words if you're living with a

68
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,880
group of people meaning two or more you can easily test and see who has the

69
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,260
better sense of taste and smell that's very easy to test on your own you don't

70
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,160
have to be a genius to figure out methods for that right so you do that

71
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,500
and that person then is assigned cooking duties unless the one who has the

72
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,540
inferior sense of smell or taste has superior skills already but then the

73
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,960
person who has the superior sense of smell and taste should start learning to

74
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,760
acquire because then when they do acquire those skills in the food quality

75
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,440
will go up period that's it that's there's there's no secret to these

76
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,260
things but again when I recommend cooking these things they must be prepared but

77
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,160
you know I did the the sonic on cooking brown rice number seven or number eight

78
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,840
right you notice how much time I spent on emphasizing the quality of the pot

79
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,480
and the seal and and various other things like that right if you don't have the

80
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,480
right equipment which is not a big deal by the way or a heat diffuser don't

81
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,800
even bother so you know or a sharp knife to slice these things thin don't even

82
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,520
bother because if it does it's not gonna if it doesn't come out tasty it's your

83
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,480
fault it's your fault so you must have the skill to do it this is a DIY we live

84
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,960
in a culture where these things look cooking is not important but you know if

85
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,580
you went back okay so Greek romanticizing the days of old no no

86
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,200
people sucked at cooking always back in the day they sucked at cooking too right

87
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,060
so you have to find the right person that has the interest in doing it right look

88
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,980
and in fairness I mean there might have been a survival as a priority in some

89
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,160
cases and that's fine I mean you know look what works works which is

90
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,980
interesting too because I have one question about this with the quality of

91
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,420
and skill sets I mean frankly when we're younger things taste different I was

92
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,560
thinking about this earlier today because because Frankie was you know

93
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,160
wanting to put ketchup on something and I didn't have any ketchup and and I was

94
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,540
like you know like he would just drown a lot of things in ketchup just because

95
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,100
and that's makes him happy he's happy with it you know but and so there were

96
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,780
certain things that might have made us happy or pleasing to us as children which

97
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,880
changed over time and it does seem to me as though you know you get a little

98
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,940
older and all of a sudden the salt is a little harsher you know to people and all

99
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,820
these things like your tastes change over time yeah you have seven years of

100
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,320
yin seven years of yang I would suggest so what does that mean okay so you'll go

101
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,580
through a period of roughly seven years where you crave salts salty snacks

102
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,060
and then you'll go through a seven year period you'll switch usually in the

103
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,560
springtime where you start craving sweets and anyone recounts their life if

104
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,060
you're older than 30 they'll say yeah you know I don't crave the sweets like I

105
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,340
used to and now I craved you know salty snacks and then and then you switch back

106
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,740
to craving sweet snacks and you know and if you start looking marking when that

107
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,380
started and you know you'll see seven year roughly a seven year cycle I'll

108
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,040
tell you one exception to that and and I think you're exactly right about the

109
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,700
seven and seven and it just it does oscillate back and forth between the two

110
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
but there is an exception to it people who have had a particularly bad

111
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,640
childhood based on my observations from you know random sampling I'm talking

112
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,700
about a couple hundred people that I've interviewed and gotten into personal

113
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,820
issues with them a bit it seems to me as though if you had what could be generally

114
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,240
described as sort of a challenging rough or tough childhood you're very much

115
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,260
attracted to sugary things it seems like sugar is one of those things that your

116
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,960
brain calls out for when when you were you know basically he had a rough time as

117
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,740
a child I don't know how to really word that properly but you might know what I'm

118
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,740
getting at here where sweetness is then described desired more the Constitution

119
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,000
like some people will lean more towards sweets their whole life and so

120
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,560
other people will lean more towards salt their whole life but you'll still have

121
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,500
that seven-year cycle so what might what might the person who created sweets at

122
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,260
one point will say well that's too sweet now I want something less sweet then

123
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,940
they'll go back to more sweet right same with the salt that's what I call the

124
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,500
Constitution but being having a rough childhood could be a good thing or a bad

125
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,840
thing it depends on the individual well of course because you could take it as

126
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,460
character building okay this taught me how to overcome adversities and how to

127
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,360
come up with unique solutions for different obstacles or this is something

128
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,040
for me to cry about sure that's different ways people take it yeah but

129
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,680
the thing is the key point that you mentioned is taught like some people

130
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,960
just don't learn I know that I have personal experience with many of them

131
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,060
they just don't learn and I being very giving and time freely give my time I'm

132
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,060
like oh this person really is stuck here and let me work with them and you

133
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,540
give them all this time and you notice oh they can't learn they don't want to

134
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,120
learn although sometimes tell you I don't want to learn you know so if

135
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,460
you're not learning yeah someone who doesn't want to learn and doesn't care

136
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,500
about it or whatever it will have a bad childhood and that will ruin their life

137
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,300
but someone who does view it as a learning experience and wants to learn

138
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,720
how to learn and learn can take that around and view it as something positive

139
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,160
fair enough I also notice that those people that I say are very consistently

140
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,720
on the sugary side their oscillation might be okay now I want these salty and

141
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,560
sweet combination for a while and then they go back to the pure let me just you

142
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,640
know consume I mean telling you what they call oh she oh mommy in Japanese

143
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,100
would be any when I prepare a meal I make sure even if it's a savory dish

144
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,140
that there is a certain amount of sweetness in their natural natural

145
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,240
occurring and if I have something that is sweet like for example you should

146
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,340
always add a little bit of salt and pastry if you don't it tastes kind of

147
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,660
bland yeah it doesn't work right yeah yeah and of course you know the the soft

148
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,380
drink makers what is it like there's a tablespoon of salt in a tablespoon of

149
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,300
sugar and a liter of coke if you couldn't eat the amount of sweetener alone

150
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,000
and or you couldn't eat the amount of salt alone but together it makes a

151
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,600
delicious beverage supposedly there is an acquired taste by the way yeah I

152
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,300
remember when I first started drinking coal as a young child it reminded me of

153
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,880
a cough syrup kind of thing I did not like it until later on in life as a

154
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,040
digestive aid very often when I go out and eat something no I don't by the way

155
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,280
I don't eat out often but if I have a greasy meal like something that requires

156
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,600
a lot of gall to digest I say oh I need a I need a coke coca-cola because that

157
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,620
for syrup phosphoric acid and the and the coca-cola bean and all that combined

158
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,580
is a digestive aid but it's extreme it's extreme it's not good for the body

159
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,880
overall unless you you can take it which by the way I wanted to mention you

160
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,160
brought up earlier it's there's been for every let's say for every two people in

161
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,080
the chat that post something about the rice and the burdock I imagine there's

162
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,560
ten others that are not that are doing it that are not posting the iceberg kind

163
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:11,460
of yeah you only hear from yeah you only hear from a small percentage of the

164
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,680
people that are literally having the same reaction it's the you know if you

165
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,140
have representative right of a group that's silent let's say right like yeah

166
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,360
like in the old days based on the you know the the information you could

167
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,960
gather everybody who called into a radio show was literally representative of

168
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,120
about a thousand people listening in in fairly populated areas say that that

169
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,300
would be and that was true it was like for this one guy to say this there's a

170
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,180
thousand of them out there it was similar outlook or question or yeah

171
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,500
interest right so with that said it's if I keep it up I'm probably gonna be known

172
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,340
as a Lundberg which means moon mountain by the way you know Berg is mountain and

173
00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:01,800
moon is my moon in German but if you keep listening to what I've been saying

174
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,560
and I keep going I'm gonna be known as the guy who tells everyone to eat

175
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,060
burdock and special kind of brown rice and that's not not at all and what I'm

176
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,100
what I'm trying to do is offer a quick solution to something that is a major

177
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,640
problem which is the food intake of most people and the easiest way to do it is

178
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,580
by simplifying it and and but but not only simplifying it but what once you

179
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,380
simplify it what is suggested as food is so good and so positive to the

180
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,100
individual that you know you use that as a springboard to then get creative with

181
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,800
other things built around that principle and the main thing here is the brown

182
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,300
rice and most people consider a carbohydrate which get away from the

183
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,280
carbs and protein idea there's no such thing there's just one nitrogen molecule

184
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,900
that separates them that's a lie it's a lie that came up a long time ago in

185
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,340
science the other thing is the burdock which is basically a thistle root thistle

186
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,820
plant is one of the most common plants and it's been very typically used as the

187
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,240
most common typical medicinal plant in other words not medicinal like take this

188
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,960
pill and drink drink this potion but to harvest and eat to have a good health

189
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,740
condition typically and it's not in the vernacular nobody talks about it at all

190
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,580
right right I mean you can see remnants of that actually that the fact that it

191
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,660
was commonplace in an ancient sort of way in in old children's stories right

192
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,720
where you literally see that there are you know people or the animal

193
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,760
anamorphic Lee represented animals right that have you know human qualities to

194
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,820
them in the stories or whatever you'll see that this will actually comes up as

195
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,300
one of their staples in their diet different that's that's good yeah the

196
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,960
other thing the other question was about someone putting together a celery mixture

197
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,380
with various other things and herbs and spices and the whole thing about this is

198
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,600
when you are going to eat vegetable even animal by the way you know clean animal

199
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,100
there are qualifications chewing the cut and having a cloven hoof four-legged

200
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,860
animal right so so there is an appearance factor and there's an appearance factor

201
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,520
with vegetable imagine if you're not growing the vegetable find out what it

202
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,760
looks like when it's growing and it has a certain balance in other words how

203
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,900
much of it is above the ground and how much of it is below the ground and then

204
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,480
when you combine it with another vegetable let's say you pick a carrot

205
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,540
which you could say more of the masses underground but you might have equal or

206
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,300
more height above ground less mass so now you want to combine that with a

207
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,280
vegetable that has more mass above ground and less massive below ground so

208
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,640
now they're balanced you see so if you let's say you look at four ingredients

209
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,140
and all four ingredients have a lot of mass under the ground and very little

210
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,580
mass above the ground you combine all those four you're going to take on the

211
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,260
quality of of things that have more mass under the ground and less mass above the

212
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,180
ground right and it's going to have a certain effect on you where if you start

213
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,160
pairing things that are their opposites or balancing geometrically you're going

214
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,000
to have a more balanced energy you know what it when you get energy from one the

215
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,380
energy from the other is going to be different and they're going to balance

216
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,620
for your body because actually we are very balanced the way we are you know

217
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,220
the center naval right and everything revolves around that and then you have

218
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,460
another revolution point so very similarly as the human body is balanced

219
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,660
our intake should be balanced right so that's basically and it's not

220
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,160
eventually if I keep on this burdock and rice thing I'll be known as the burdock

221
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,820
and rice guy and then you fall into I know I'm just saying I don't think it'll

222
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,200
happen I've never been typecast or whatever but although although you were

223
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:56,620
the Bible guru for a little bit that's what I would say is it's about finding

224
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,760
out something that works really really well that's easily it's temperate you

225
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,420
know it's not tropical where it's easy to get now I thought all this stuff was

226
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,940
easy to get because I always tend to live in a place that's more international and

227
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,420
Tucson Arizona I wouldn't say is very international but it's the biggest

228
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,560
little city I've ever lived in you can pretty much get anything I can get

229
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,480
anywhere else here better than LA I'll tell you that for sure

230
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,080
and you say LA you know no easily that's understandable I mean look it's not

231
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,500
going to be New York but yeah if you have access to things like that on you

232
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,360
know from various sources yeah most of the variety and choices yeah well

233
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,780
actually all the veg that I have mentioned I have three or four sources

234
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,940
here in Tucson I could go and buy them available right so in other places you

235
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,440
know you go to LA may yeah I think you will there because they have an Asian

236
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,360
community you know just because it's Asian is on this this is not a modified

237
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,380
Asian diet these things are also used to grow here but they were there no longer

238
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,680
they were in a careful environment a lot of these things grew by rivers that no

239
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,900
you know what are rivers these days they're industrial dumping grounds right

240
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,360
right or whatever so yeah so these things were part of a subtle ecology that was

241
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,219
wiped out or disregarded but if you live near a park or you know how they

242
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,800
have lands what is it called medians around highways oh yeah dividers and

243
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,820
dividers yeah and there's usually a berm of dirt that you know before the

244
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,260
neighborhood starts if you know what burdock looks like you'll find it

245
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,440
commonly all over the country by the way but you know what it looks like above

246
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,120
ground but you know if it grows in the wild you won't be able to dig it out

247
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,659
that easily I found some in a park and I wanted to get out and only broke off

248
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,699
like a two-inch piece off the top it just cannot pull be pulled out must be

249
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,100
dug dug out or grown in a way where you can harvest it easily so yeah by the way

250
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,780
there is so much crazy you know I always by the way there's a thing going on

251
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:57,080
right now it was a keto or carbon protein the keto diet deal with the yeah

252
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,120
yeah and I keep you know my joke about the diet or what died there is oh yeah

253
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,660
we keep changing the diets every 15 years because mankind's only been around

254
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,400
for less than a hundred years right so we saw you know we don't know what to do

255
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,180
because we've only been around for less than a century so that makes that make

256
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,720
sense we need to keep changing the diets it's just a joke and the people that

257
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,560
fall for these no carb or it was no red meat then it was no fat right and then

258
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,020
it was no carbs and then it was no gluten then for a little while it's all

259
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,520
red meat just read yeah and then that idiot that it was all about that is all

260
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,960
fat what was his name he fell down and broke crack and said the old was Tucker

261
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,580
Atkins on ice Atkins yeah oh my gosh I'm not but when I heard he fell down

262
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,400
cracked his head on ice I was like good cuz he was not doing good for people and

263
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,780
he went away when he went away fortunately yeah all this stuff is so

264
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,680
stupid so stupid and you could actually you know how I said you could tell the

265
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,040
character of a person by food yes that when people fall for these diets not not

266
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,540
a flaw but it's definitely a fault when you fall for these items shows that you

267
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,960
have no knowledge of the body no knowledge of this that or the other you

268
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,660
want it you want a snapshot of what you should think of of the Atkins diet I

269
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,020
mean Rob Lowe is the like corporate spokesperson for all the Atkins based

270
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:21,040
products now you know just say it's perfect right that's a Rob Lowe yikes

271
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,500
anyway interesting history on that guy we've gotten into that before so look I

272
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,640
don't want to take up too much more of your time but if you wouldn't mind I

273
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,880
mean a brief a couple of minutes on it has there been any change or anything

274
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,200
that you've noted given given a couple of things first of all we just had to

275
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,560
what they call an eclipse and indeed there is a reason for calling it an

276
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,960
eclipse and that just happened I saw that through some welding goggles old

277
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,240
school welding goggles the welding mask the automatic welding mask I have would

278
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,540
not adjust to it yeah it's pretty neat to get that kind of light on your eye

279
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,960
and it was interesting at nine o'clock in the morning here at 930 you had this

280
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:08,520
silver sodium electric lamp kind of almost noon kind of sunlight right right

281
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,680
and Madame Calisco who was a metallurgist in France turn of the

282
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,520
century 20th century she was could be attributed you shoot her and Hoshka and

283
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,420
other people like that Germans in that part of the world Austrians about the

284
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:29,500
effects of solar and moon and stars on crystallization of metals and solutions

285
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,600
and when there was a solar eclipse yeah metals would not crystallize like if you

286
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,320
have a I assure you if you're running like a chrome metal plating plant you

287
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,400
know like for plating doorknobs or bathroom fixtures or whatever you had a

288
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,480
lot of defects today if you were running the shop today so it is important yeah

289
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,580
yeah that's the eclipse couple weird things actually just because of the

290
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,880
electromagnetic kind of atmosphere that I think is also sort of disrupted I had

291
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,000
a little you know a couple issues with computers and things today but thankfully

292
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,400
I was away from the computers again at the flea market I kind of wish I was

293
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,240
able to take pictures of some of the stuff that that Chinese guy was selling I

294
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,940
didn't understand half of what he was saying he was trying to speak English

295
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,040
but it was just fascinating to me that he had a whole bunch of things there that

296
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,340
were totally unrecognizable to not just things like what jewelry shoes what oh

297
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,440
no the the the vegetable section he did have other stuff too oh so he was a

298
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Chinese guy selling groceries okay got it he had to get a picture witness you

299
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,460
know he had some groceries but he also had some of those other things you were

300
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,760
talking about too like you know here's other products too he had like you know

301
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,140
traditional Chinese products no like ribbons for craft the craft working like

302
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,100
you know people that want to get ribbons to make craft projects stuff like that

303
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,980
and then he had a brick yeah brick ribbon fabric stuff and another table

304
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:01,400
indeed for like well electrical products not electronic but like you know like a

305
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,000
leaf blower and some other things that were you know sounded like he raided

306
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,480
someone's storage locker go ahead seemed like it yes but apparently he also

307
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,800
consistently brings in these vegetables which are that's okay the high point of

308
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,880
my day was was almost as bad as that but go ahead sorry yeah no it was I went to

309
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,040
the flea market did a little work and you know I was hustling a little bit

310
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,660
trying to get some money because we're gonna have a little interruption in the

311
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,640
rated wise coming up in a few weeks guys because I will be on the road and it

312
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,580
will be impossible for me to really sit down and record with the Greek for about

313
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:42,260
a week so I figured that'll give you time to do that and then when I get back

314
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,360
we'll get right back to it but but you know just little disruption you knew

315
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,120
about this a while ago I told you sure but but anyway I'm just letting people

316
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,900
know in case they don't see him they don't think oh you know they're not

317
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,900
gonna do him anymore that's I think the worst yeah yeah so just wanted to make

318
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,400
that note so before we're done though um just a really quick check-in on has

319
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,720
there been any change or anything that you've taken note of regarding this

320
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,340
situation over there we mentioned the you know the prime ministers and well

321
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,660
nothing yet I mean no it's the same old same old it's just on a different scale

322
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,960
and what I what I predict is there's going to be more conflict other nations

323
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,200
like there'll be another conflict breakout like India Pakistan or there

324
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,700
was a small note on Azerbaijan and Armenia and there's a Turkey might go

325
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,560
invade somewhere they have to do a couple of you know how they do these

326
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,740
forest fires now right you know or the Great Chicago fire you know started by a

327
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,940
cow kicked over a lantern but it the fire crossed over the river right you

328
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,180
know rivers 300 feet wide and started the fire on the other side of its out

329
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,800
in the bullshit right of course so they have to start a few more fires yeah yeah

330
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,620
to make what what's coming more let's say plausible yeah how does a fire

331
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:03,540
literally stretch you know 300 meters across water 100 meters yeah and this is

332
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,200
Chicago fire I'm talking about which doesn't make sense at all none of this

333
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,600
is going to make sense so you already have the Ukraine battle going on there's

334
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,320
at least 20 or 30 conflicts going on that the media doesn't cover it all on the

335
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,360
continent of Africa hot-hot conflicts yeah that's been that's been a case

336
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,000
minimally I've been able to observe that for the past decade by the way that it's

337
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,360
like why are they not even mentioning this but okay yeah good well because

338
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,620
they're isolated and they have their own world and we're not you know they don't

339
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,820
have a flood myth you know they're like in their own little enclave of reality

340
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,960
and yeah and they're smart they've gotten fortunate that continent has

341
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,900
gotten smart enough not to fall for the white man's tricks you know the banking

342
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,180
tricks too much you know right the way you know why that you know how they do

343
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,300
that is when someone let's say does fault a group of a country or an

344
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,660
organization or an institution or a group of people let's say a village or

345
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,480
neighborhood does fall for the Western banking system stuff they get a lot of

346
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,960
flack from everyone around them for doing so and it's like almost like a

347
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,240
lesson so other people don't yeah but anyway you'll have those conflicts but

348
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm talking about more Eastern Asia well South let's see South Central Asia a few

349
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,160
more battle breakouts and then some bad shit happening in the West probably a

350
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,080
few false flag type you know what a truck will drive to a crowd of 200

351
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:33,620
people or a couple of wild shootings you know some impossible guy with a 40

352
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,760
rounds and manages to shoot 120 people you know you know some you know you

353
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,540
don't have a traveling stage show for that they kill real people they kill

354
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,220
people oh no no no yeah that's the thing I never by the way I mean I would argue

355
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,960
with you if you said oh people don't really die because I think that's one of

356
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,140
the most idiotic things no it's a state you know look the more realistic it

357
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,960
looks the better so therefore yeah yeah absolutely well just just the last

358
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,200
question of clarification though when you say the West I mean it doesn't

359
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,060
necessarily mean what they call the United States it could be Europe right

360
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:17,940
or yeah I say from from Germany West all the way to California when I say West

361
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:23,100
fair enough yeah it's all of what's considered Europe proper and the states

362
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,460
here including South America okay well then then there you have it I mean

363
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,080
potentially what you're saying is looks if something really insane happens in

364
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,340
Canada even still counts yeah it's gonna get it's gonna go crazy but to justify

365
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:45,460
the means for what's coming which is basically a religious war the only thing

366
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,700
that I've noted and again this is why I tried to tie it to cosmic censorship and

367
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,700
maybe I did it incorrectly last time but just really fast is that you know I'm

368
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,800
taking note that there are people that are I don't know if it's self

369
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,140
censorship or if it is a condition of just you know the situation here but I

370
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,280
mean literally you have people that deny realities where it's like look can we

371
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,680
even begin the conversation by accepting that this or that happened there are

372
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,540
people that just know that's just not the reality regardless of what you put

373
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:23,240
in front of them regardless of what you can demonstrate or etc etc they just go

374
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,680
with an NPC yeah yeah which is 90% of the population by the way yeah sad state

375
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,540
of affairs in my mind but it's always been that way so we're welcome to a

376
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,820
planet Earth right you've been on this planet for more than an hour you should

377
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,500
Accept that as fact, yeah.

378
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,800
Exactly.
