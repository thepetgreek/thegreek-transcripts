1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,060
Sonic Event 61, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y. So, why? Let's get into it. Why? Because

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,380
we love you. Where did that come from? Oh, that's right, it was a TV show.

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,180
Oh, please, please, no, I'm not kidding. I'm not in the mood tonight for that. That's fine.

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,620
I just wanted to throw it at you because I knew you weren't expecting it. A little break in the

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,960
pattern, right? That's fine. It's nighttime here and I'm laying down because I just can't stop

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:43,340
yawning. So, anyway, yeah, Israel, we said let's just do a quick update. It's a project.

7
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,860
Well, we got to open up on it because it is now. Now, here, part of the project I would like you

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,360
to address right out of the gate, then, is the fact that it is on so many people's minds. It's

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,780
occupying a lot of their thought. And is this not in and of itself part of the purpose of the

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,200
project? Go ahead. Yeah, that's right. It's a project. It's a media project. It's a financial

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,640
project. It's a cultural project. All these will eventually become religious. Pretty much like I

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,300
talked about for the past three decades now, the Middle East Union, but it's not going to be like

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,160
the EU. I did speak on private Skype calls with someone who had visited Israel a month ago for a

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,660
month, and he was amazed at how accurate the presumptions and prognostications that I made

15
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,400
were regarding everything military politics and how things are being set up or not set up. And

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,100
it's basically to abuse the consciousness to the point where people feel like they're losing

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,420
control because they will lose control to a new type of system that's emerging. And this is a

18
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:58,360
matter of people utilizing the vague concepts of end times stuff, right? In the mind, I'm not saying

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,840
not take that seriously. What I am saying is the interpretation that people carry around with them

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,560
where they're waiting. Yeah, that's what's not to be taken seriously because the Christian mindset

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,900
now has got to be a bit. If you're listening to me, hopefully you don't have any of that

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,600
Christianity, churchianity, stuff that they talk about, you know, out of your mind,

23
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,080
the Jesus, all that stuff. Yeah, well, straight out of the gate, if you've gotten, you know,

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
if you actually have gotten through the 60 pieces, or even a good chunk of them,

25
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,000
you should already be aware of that. You know, this project loss, it's a project,

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,220
this project is cumulative. We never really started from the beginning. The first couple of episodes,

27
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,200
we kind of got a little deep into the spirit. And so just to show the separation, which is

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,260
interesting, one of the videos in the, in the chat, it was, I believe, the DNA that was transmitted

29
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,700
over wire or air, basically, a DNA sample could be reproduced anywhere in the world,

30
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,540
using, you know, radio, basically, or signal or, you know, a connection, you like a phone or

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,140
something to another part of the world in distilled water. And it's kind of mystifies a lot

32
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,640
of people, it's magic, but it's not, that's how the body works. Because the signal being sent over to

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,920
to the receiving station has some form of amplification when it gets there, like an

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,820
op amp, you know, some kind of amplification on that side, and that amplification produces

35
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,520
enough current voltage information to do what to the water induction. And that's exactly how

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,460
so the way the DNA is sent across the world, and supposedly magically appears in water,

37
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,780
how incredible water is, yes, is the same way that the food gets inside the body when it's

38
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,220
in the intestines, exactly the same method. That's why speaking, if I get more to the point

39
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,880
where I want to keep working on these projects, we'll like we've talked about the water device,

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:02,680
we're going to be talking about induction devices, but I, for personal, everybody cover your ears,

41
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,640
I feel like I'm condemned to be on this planet with morons. And it's kind of like walking

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,300
waist high in mud, versus walking on a road. So I want to cross the street, I want to go here,

43
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:20,100
I want to go there as a metaphor, you want to sit on the ground, you want to seek dry land a bit.

44
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,660
Oh, my gosh, everything. It's like three steps forward, two steps back with everyone.

45
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,780
And here's, here's not an excuse. But I think an explanation, and it ties directly to what you're

46
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,860
saying. And that is, look, I think back often to the old tropes about the guys who used to scream

47
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,320
that the CIA was, you know, broadcasting, you know, radio waves into their brains directly.

48
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,620
And people used to make jokes out of that, they could actually do it, we come to find out, but

49
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,280
it's far worse than that. Because any, if we were to break this topic open, just for a second,

50
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,380
just peek at it for a second. The truth is that this very baseline, this very absolute, like

51
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,360
essential piece of reality that is the induction, induction in so many different ways, what you can

52
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,420
take in psychologically, spiritually, physically, etc, through the air, the water, the food,

53
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,300
through the communication of information, noise, everything.

54
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,260
It's non physical. Well, it's not electrons moving through anything either, you know,

55
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,200
well, but they've put their, okay, they're not using the electrons, but what but they are

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,100
utilizing physical things. It's pressure, it's a pressure gradient in the ether.

57
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,220
And it's a mass grid, so that all bases are covered. I mean, the way I see it, maybe I'm wrong.

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,520
But look, the way I see it is they've covered all the physical ground they can,

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,980
because look, if your your interaction with this world is you would have to agree,

60
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,060
based on what it is we breathe, what it is we consume, right, and put into our bodies,

61
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,840
because that begins another process, and does literally build us right through induction.

62
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,900
So we're literally getting it from cradle to grave.

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,280
Well, it's ether. It's the ether. Well, it's not see what

64
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Hmm. When you're inside the video game,

65
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
they don't talk unless they're trying to do an advertisement in the video game,

66
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,320
they don't talk about the video game in the video game, right? It's like the guy

67
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,880
who wrote the book, the simulacrum that they showed in the matrix is when you're in the

68
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,140
simulacrum simulacrum, you don't talk about the simulacrum. Well, of course not. Because when

69
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,320
you're in a movie, you don't talk about that you're in a movie, it's actually been broken

70
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,780
and done several times, right? But it's not remembered.

71
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,760
No, absolutely. But that's the thing is that this is about that, you know, what they call

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,420
a fourth wall break, where, indeed, you're supposed to be just immersed. And therefore,

73
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,400
it's part of the accepted reality. You know, john can take on an army of people going back

74
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,640
to Keanu Reeves, john wick can take on an army of people. Is that possible? Yes, maybe. But

75
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,320
you're supposed to believe that that's not only possible, but an accepted part of that reality

76
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,220
that he is the, whatever they call them, they had a name for him throughout it. But I don't

77
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,460
know if you ever saw those movies. But you're aware of the concept where he's this like unbeatable,

78
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,720
super killer guy, who's dealing with, you know, the great secret organization that is actually

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,440
responsible for all the assassinations and murders that go on on a real level, they exchange

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,140
gold coins, which is true. You know, all that is true. But see, while you're in the movie,

81
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,420
you're supposed to take it as Yes, it's a movie. But it's the immersive experience.

82
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,740
That's not Deanna. Well, that's john.

83
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,440
You know, let me just say this. I'm yawning, because I did some pretty hard landscaping

84
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,920
past two days. And in Tucson here, it's used to be an ancient seabed. And when you dig down,

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,880
it's like medium mortar. It's like, shovel, you break shovels, you have to use picks. It's

86
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,920
very hard, right? Anyone who's into engineering, it's the ground is in the 200 to 400 psi range,

87
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:04,940
right? Like, it's a little softer than pine, right? So anyway, planted for bougainvillea

88
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,320
trees. But here's, here's the metaphor. There's a Frank Herbert do metaphoric, it ties into

89
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,280
everything we just said, including the DNA and Israel and everything, what is a gift, not a gift.

90
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,880
When you make it when you make the object, that's a gift, really, really heavy, very heavy. When you

91
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,980
give it to an ordinary man, you'll notice its weight, and he'll drop it. But if you give it to

92
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:38,980
a good man, he'll continue to carry it until it crushes him. Right. So tie that into what I was

93
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:45,240
saying, I'm not saying I'm a good man, but I'm crushed. Because I just have to like, here's the

94
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,320
thing. And this is not this may be a little more personal than I ever say I want to talk about.

95
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,960
But I'm always looking for people to jam with, I'm always looking for people to have, you know,

96
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,200
comprehension and all this other way. But after a while, you just start selling saying to yourself,

97
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,720
just like everyone else has come before anyone else has realized what's going on here. Do nothing.

98
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,800
Do nothing, just abandon, just do nothing, just live. Right? Don't, you know, but I'm still

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,640
working on stuff, you know. And so when you get to that point, that it's like, Oh, man, you know,

100
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,940
it starts to begin to feel it feels like a condemnation, you know. So anyway, but yeah,

101
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,920
it's it can crush you. And it could kill you. It's very easy for people to kill you with words.

102
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,660
Also, when you start paying attention, right, when you understand the importance of words,

103
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,820
and what people say, and how they structure it, and communications can kill you.

104
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,600
That's why, for example, when you look at the NPCs in the society, when they see the media,

105
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,420
let's be pumped out right now, they don't see through it, they see like body counts,

106
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,620
oh, how bad even though they're not real, by the way, right? No one's really counting bodies,

107
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,960
by the way, when they when the body count changes day by day, no one's out there tallying anything

108
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,920
up. It's all made up, by the way, right? Right. You know, if you talk to anyone who's ever been

109
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,020
in a war, no one's counting bodies. The only time bodies are counted and not even reported

110
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,680
are when people die in hospital or in medic, in the hands of medics. By the way, the only way

111
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,960
legally they could give a body count is when a die, they die in the hands of a medic or recorded

112
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,540
by a medic. Right? Well, it's generally accepted almost anywhere that the only person that can

113
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:34,780
sign off on a thing without doing a postmortem examination is a doctor or even that, you know,

114
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:42,440
in a vac, what do they call those military hospitals? Like mash? Oh, yeah, the master

115
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,360
triage. Yeah, right. Yeah, you could be declared dead. But so all these body counts that they're

116
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,260
giving are totally illegal. Yeah, you don't get an official count. When you're declared dead in

117
00:10:52,260 --> 00:11:00,140
the triage or whatever, you only get the official count can only be had when a doctor signs a slip of

118
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,880
paper, which says this person legally, you don't have to be but you have to be given the authority

119
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,940
you could be if it goes through power of attorney, right? Well, yeah, they can hand it over. But

120
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,540
generally speaking, what I'm saying is that what's universally accepted is and I know this by

121
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,260
example, just to throw in, yeah, just to throw in 911. Again, you know, the initial corner report

122
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,880
for the cause of death of the victims in the buildings was vaporization. You know what

123
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,380
vaporization means? They have these things instead of smoking their vape, you know, the vape, you know,

124
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,360
vapor is vapor. It's, it's not particle, you've been completely dematerialized, right,

125
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,220
basically into a gas. Well, you've learned from a solid thing into effectively steam. Yeah,

126
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,680
there's no blood. Yeah, there's no blunt force or building collapse that can vaporize anyone,

127
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,740
but a nuclear demolition would anyway. And when a lot of the families were inquiring,

128
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,200
they changed it. So I don't know what something else. Well, that's why those reports read as

129
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:06,160
preliminary until that's why they read that way around. Yeah. But either way. So either way,

130
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,540
don't don't fall for it. So here's the thing. When you start to become more critical, you

131
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:18,660
it's good. But you become more sensitive, like something that people joke around about.

132
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,300
I'm not saying this has happened to me. I'm just giving an example here. There's something that

133
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,360
people would normally joke around. If you become more objectified, and more, let's say,

134
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,220
word citing and what's going on. And if you let's say the brunt of a joke or something,

135
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,280
it could be very hurtful, right? Well, this is common. Yeah, we don't want to make anyone the

136
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,840
brunt of a joke. Yeah, real simple is somebody, you know, recently just died from cancer.

137
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,560
Somebody makes a joke about cancer or somebody's hair falling out during chemotherapy or whatever,

138
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,940
you'll notice a shift in that conversation all of a sudden when they recognize,

139
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,100
oh, wait a minute, I just said something and his wife, girlfriend, brother, son,

140
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,980
recently died. The whole cancer thing is pretty wild, too, because it's, it's not what people

141
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,960
think it is. Oh, no, I'm just using it as it could be anything could be about drunk driving.

142
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,220
And recently, somebody was killed by someone who was intoxicated. Let's grab a drink. Yeah.

143
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,740
Yeah, you don't want to you don't want to hit a bump and spill your drink, right?

144
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,580
Yeah, you don't want to be the guy going, no, I, you know, stupid joke, right? I

145
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,620
just pay the piano. And my sister has no hands. I'm not drinking and driving,

146
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,980
you know, because I drink and I go driving, you know, things like that. Yeah, exactly. And then

147
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,020
you do that in front of, you know, they just had somebody they care about run over by a car.

148
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,760
Yeah, they go, wait a minute, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But the here's the other thing. I was

149
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,300
very intelligent engineering type person research discussion. And he kind of some reason the flat

150
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,140
earth globe Earth came up, right? Okay. And I was like, you cannot function that way,

151
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,220
you have to have an overview of the condition of the mind. And what do you mean? It's like,

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,500
when you want to objectify, let's say the shape of the Earth, for example,

153
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,080
does it you know, you're about flat Earth is going to be objectified either way.

154
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,040
Once you are living in a subjective reality, actually, you existed in a subjective reality

155
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,600
before you started making the effort to objectify it, right? So once you start trying to objectify

156
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:26,580
something that you accepted is subjectively true, on your when you start changing modes,

157
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,180
and you start looking at objectively, it starts to become subjective.

158
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,380
When you be so in other words, when you are living a subjective life,

159
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,880
everything around you seems to be objective. But once you decide to start making the decision

160
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,120
to start objectifying things, the things that you look at become subjective. It's strange,

161
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,180
it's kind of like you want to be real, you want to do a precision measurement on cutting a shelf.

162
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,720
So instead of just measuring it inches or half inch or quarter inch, you measure it down to

163
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,800
32nd or 64th of an inch. And you can check it twice and you cut it. And you come back and you

164
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,960
try to fit it and it's really off, worse off than if you just made a rough measurement. And you're

165
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,800
like, holy crap. If I just made a rough measurement, it would have fit better. I'm trying to

166
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,640
make this precise measurement and it's worse. What this doesn't make any sense. It's not like the guy

167
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,300
that says, Look, I cut this board three times and it's still too short. I don't know why. Right?

168
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,940
No, I'm talking about when you start releasing subjectivity and choosing objectivity,

169
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,340
you'll notice that the things that you're trying to objectify cannot be objectified,

170
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,360
and they become more and more subjective. Right? This goes with people. This goes with things with

171
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,060
science and all these other things. So well, another thought is, regardless of whether you

172
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,740
think the earth is a flat or round, right? How do you make anything at all level? Because the moment

173
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,100
that's my point. Yeah. If you want it to be round, it will be round. If you want it to be flat,

174
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,020
it will be flat. But architect that a far architects in agriculture rely on it being

175
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:11,780
flat and it's in the center doesn't move. Right? We're map makers. And sometimes aviators and

176
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,920
navigators find that it's round. I've witnessed the curvature from doing survey. We tried and we

177
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,960
started off four and a half miles apart and we used the Adelaide, Philadelphia rod, you know,

178
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,600
to measure to meet in the middle. And we were off by seventy five feet over four miles. And they

179
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,700
did the math and all that. And they're like, yeah, it's some of it's the terrain, but it's

180
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,960
the curvature of the earth. So we did it again. You ended up being off. That's why in a lot of

181
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,880
maps you'll notice a step in the borders of states and counties. They're not pieced together evenly.

182
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,620
And also we try to lay out a large triangle at one hundred and eighty degrees, you know,

183
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,660
and it couldn't couldn't do it. It was always slightly greater than one hundred and eighty

184
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,160
degrees because of the curvature of the earth. But water is level. Right. And a plumb bob is

185
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,660
plumb and level. And the agriculture I've seen ditch canals in Blythe, Arizona, run for seven,

186
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,640
eight miles, ignoring, you know, we're talking about only eighth inch drop every 20 feet.

187
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,319
And they that decline was good enough for seven or eight miles. But if we're going against the

188
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,280
curvature of the earth. So. Right. And so it acted completely flat. So I don't know if you

189
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,380
want it to be flat. It's flat. You want it to be round. It's round. So you cannot be objectified.

190
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,760
In 30 seconds, I can tell you that a guy who made a living as a military sniper,

191
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,700
who was actually a fairly well-known one, sort of explained something similar to me,

192
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,520
where, look, at a certain point, you have to accept the curvature of the earth

193
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,000
because it depends on what you're doing. That's a sniper. So that's what I was getting to,

194
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,360
is that it depends on what you're doing. You can deal in straight lines in some circumstance

195
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,820
and in others. And that makes no sense to me. I'm sitting there saying, well, look,

196
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,560
either you have to deal with it or you don't. Right. But he's telling me that regardless of

197
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,040
what I think, that's not how it is. I've been on the flat portion of I-10 and took out some

198
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:21,560
binoculars that knew the object was 36 miles away and I could see the flat road, no curvature for

199
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,060
36 miles. Right. And so there's no way, you know, there's eight inches every mile or anything

200
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,380
because it would have to have dropped off. But in other places, like I said, I've actually

201
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,220
physically measured the curvature, could not could not make a triangle. Right. To literally

202
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,600
put a bullet through a dime at a mile away. Guess what? You need that curvature.

203
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,600
Or not, depending on how you're raised. Well, most likely the flat earther will end up by the

204
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,420
round earther compensating and one not compensating for the curve will both get it. Yeah. The weird

205
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,960
thing is what I was going to point out to you is that the guy who mechanically has to use it in

206
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,700
order to accomplish his task. Right. He's putting a bullet in a very precise place from a distance.

207
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,120
If that could be a mile. Yeah, that's what I'm saying is a mile away. Five thousand feet plus.

208
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,380
Yes. There at that point. Easily. It's I mean, maybe it's before that, after that, too. I don't

209
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,800
know. But what I what he gave. I've heard of three thousand yards, mile and a half being the record

210
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,220
or something like that. Some crazy like that. Yeah. Well, but that's the thing is he was telling

211
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,100
me that a mile when you get to the mile, you have to account for this this way. And it wasn't even

212
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,700
like I was trying to have a flat earth discussion with the guy. This is what I'm saying. This is

213
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:44,200
the whole thing I've been trying to objectify now for decades. And you are when you start off.

214
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,240
Don't mistake this for objectification, but it seems like it. And this is an error that I've

215
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,220
made. Like, for example, when people talk about stuff in the Bible or the money system of law,

216
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,400
what you think you're going to go objectify and you start reading it and you're like, wow,

217
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,900
this is contrary to what everyone's saying it is. Right. So because you find the information

218
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,800
that has been put out about something to be contrary to the way people are using it does

219
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,660
not mean it's objective to objectify either. All it means is that no one knows what the rules are

220
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,180
and no one's following the rules because they don't. Well, if they seem like they're following

221
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,240
the rules, it happens to be a happenstance because they can't tell you where they got it.

222
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,880
Right. And can't show you where they got it, regardless of any of those subjects, even scientific.

223
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,820
But it seems to because of their subjectivity, they think they're objective. They're not.

224
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,760
Things are still working. It just seems that people say the system. How can you? The system

225
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,900
has all been laid out on paper. Like if you say religious system, it's laid out in books.

226
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,660
If you talk about financial system, the Federal Reserve puts out publications in history of how

227
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,700
it does it. But if you ask people how these things work and what they're supposed to be based on,

228
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,620
no one really knows. Yeah, it's an old, weird concept of, you know, the whole thing with the

229
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,800
lasers and the lights where they say just by observation, it literally changes the characteristic

230
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,100
of the thing through observation. You say to yourself of complex diffraction. Yeah. The

231
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,920
particle or wave theory. That's another thing that that that came out. That's part of quantum,

232
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,580
which is which is not quantum. It's fine perturbances in the ether, as Ken Wheeler might

233
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,300
say. But I wouldn't say. But what I'm saying is that we are subjective beings in a subjective

234
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:35,460
reality. And you should still. All right. So am I saying do not objectify? No, definitely

235
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,580
attempt to objectify, because what you'll find on the way is priceless. Right. And you actually

236
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,600
could be used in your favor many times over. You'll have a deep understanding. But once you

237
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,240
start seeing that none of these things are being used and known by others, typically the typical,

238
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,220
the average person who uses them, talking about professionals now even. Yeah. And the system still

239
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,080
holds together. That means that it's subjective system all the way down. You could say it's

240
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,140
subjective or you could say that those hard and fast rules of the reality are definitely dependent

241
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:16,500
on circumstantial issues. So as long as the people think they're objective but remain subjective.

242
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,460
Okay. Henry Ford said if people found out how the money system works, there'll be a revolution

243
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,460
overnight. Right. Well, how did he propose people find out? He never said that. Well, the money

244
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,320
system. Well, it's very easy. You just go find out how fiat currency works. Right. Yeah. And it is

245
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,240
based on ledgers. Right. On their thing. But the way that they produce the money is completely

246
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,640
unlawful, even in their own text. Right. And they even give you a remedy for it. But no one seems to

247
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,420
apply that or know that. But once you get into that and you study it, it baffles the mind on how

248
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,660
people defend something that is working against them. And it's the same thing with the medical

249
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:01,160
and the religious system, like the Christians. How can a God that's so loving that created

250
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,540
everything, send someone, condemn them to a fiery place. It doesn't make any sense. Right. Right.

251
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,400
So which he doesn't. So by the way, in the scripture, there is no place where you condemn

252
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,640
to. That's fire. I got you. You know, an odd thing that occurs to me. Are you familiar with

253
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Larkin Rose? I've heard of the name. OK, but I don't know what he does. He's a writer. You know,

254
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,960
he's one of these guys irrelevant because there's just one particular key piece that I think would

255
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,120
be of interest to you. Have you ever heard of the Jones Plantation? No. OK. You mean the one down the

256
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,220
one down where everybody took took the punch? No, this is a this is something that's created.

257
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,900
Not not not that fictional. No, it's it's not a cult or anything like that. It is fictional,

258
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,200
but it is metaphoric and makes some of the points. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think I might have

259
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,780
heard of it. And there's a slave that they use as an example. Well, not only the example,

260
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,960
it's more complex than that. If you actually go through it, there's like a 13 minute version of

261
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,880
this cartoon. But they recently made it into like a full length movie, independent movie.

262
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,680
And is this how they everyone wanted something better? In the end, they showed you basically

263
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,980
the leaders showed them that that's not what they wanted. And whoever spoke out against it was bad.

264
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,780
Well, that was part of it. But OK, so I did come across something like the overall thing is about

265
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,140
the concept of, you know, slavery still being the condition of most people. They've just simply

266
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,860
changed the way it's done. And yeah, I mean, ultimately, I'll tell you what, don't worry about

267
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,840
it. I'm going to I'm going to send you something when we're done talking today. I got you. They

268
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,760
have not changed. Here's the thing. Yeah. Take advantage. Yeah, good. I'm glad you said that.

269
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,740
I'll tell you why. And you'll see why. Because we've been told that slavery is black people

270
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,060
that are in chains with whipping scars on their backs, photos and all these stories. Right. Yes.

271
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,260
But saying that I'm not denying that. No, slavery was very complex then. It's very complex now.

272
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:13,840
Right. And so it has not changed. Right. What our ability to see it to its core or how it really

273
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,580
functions has never been brought to light. It's always been a legal condition. You and I in the

274
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,300
old O.G. years ago, I said, you know, slavery is a lawful condition that is bound legally.

275
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:33,020
In other words, you can have slaves in law, but you have to bind them legally. So whenever you

276
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,700
have a system. So in other words, the legal system is for business entities and slaves.

277
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,900
That's what this. So if they only have a offering you a legal system in your society, that means

278
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,900
you either have a business or you're a slave. If you're dealing with legal or illegal, you know,

279
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,820
the you know, that sick bird and illegal. Yeah. Yeah. So so there's no law. Talk about law. Now

280
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,840
they do talk about law and they think they, you know, whatever. I talk about law and order.

281
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,280
Yeah. The thing about American slavery, first of all, that was done.

282
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:13,320
That was not done the way we were told, by the way. And the setup, there was a big setup that

283
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,200
was done for a reason with that. And that's why if you if you study what Abraham Lincoln

284
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,540
wanted to do, it was not a race issue. You know, anyway, there's Yeah, here's the other thing.

285
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,040
I want to mention this because I've had some conversations with people much older than myself.

286
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,040
And one of them was an engineer who designed a black man who engineer engineer designed most of

287
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,300
the highways in Atlanta. And I said, Oh, damn you, because it sucks. You know, because Yeah,

288
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,720
but it was a good idea. It was the best engineering we had at the same at the time.

289
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Oh, yeah. For God's sake, though. Yeah. Yeah. If you go to that part of the country,

290
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,320
like five, you have to go through Atlanta, right? It's 90 minutes away from me. It is

291
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,900
not pleasant. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. Anywhere you go south or nearby, you have to go through this

292
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:11,580
anyway. But he was upset because the civil rights movement was backwards. And so was this is not

293
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,460
race. This is just politics and legal and slavery all mixed together. It's not just about race.

294
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,720
But he was not happy about the civil rights movement. And but and he was very happy about the

295
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,700
what's it called, where you have to hire what they call minorities, affirmative action would have

296
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,880
action. Yeah. And he says both of those are misunderstood. I think I went over the affirmative

297
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,180
action. Do you remember the reason what the real reason for affirmative action was because he was

298
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:44,240
part of it. You're part of this study. I you know, I vaguely remember this. I remember being so really,

299
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,220
I was so shocked over the idea, although you were correct, that slavery was like,

300
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:57,520
you know, this is no, this is an example to show how the race and social status and slavery and

301
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,220
people that are caught up in it are being used for both good and bad. Now, affirmative action,

302
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,480
we're told that which is true to a degree that certain professional jobs were lacking in

303
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,700
minorities. And minority, by the way, is not the color of your skin means if you're competent or

304
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,720
not, like, you know, you're a minority or a minor when you're less than 18. Right. So let's say you

305
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,640
did a newspaper route for, let's say, from 13, you could start legally, right, working paper,

306
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,200
searching 14. So 16, and you saved up enough cash to buy a brand new Cadillac. So you walk

307
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,080
into the Cadillac dealership with a bag full of cash at 17. And you buy the Cadillac and drive it

308
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,320
home. Do you know that you have to bring the Cadillac back and give you your money because

309
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,860
you cannot enter into a purchase and sale legal agreement at that age, you have to be 18 or older?

310
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,900
Well, yeah. Okay. There's certain places where they've played with those numbers a little bit,

311
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,880
like, yeah, it could be 17 and a half. Now they're trying to, which, by the way, when you turn 17,

312
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,140
you're in your 18th year, by the way. And they have this other thing where, you know, you get the

313
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,340
agreement, like those that want to get married at the age of 16.

314
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,740
Yeah, certain states. Yes. But the point here is, if you're a minority, you cannot enter

315
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,120
into contracts and make decisions for yourself, right? That's not on your own. Because even if

316
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,240
you get married at the age of 16, you have to have a parent sign off on it. That's, that's right.

317
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:29,200
That's right. So, okay, so what was so this is I just defined minority. So you don't want to be a

318
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,180
minority based on what they tell you does means you're incompetent. You're not competent to make

319
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,780
decisions for yourself. Yeah. So being called a minority because of the color of your skin,

320
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,380
or the race or whatever they put in the birth certificate is an insult. You should not be

321
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:49,080
called a minority to your face or in society. That means that you're perpetually never going

322
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,120
to mature. Because that's one of the things that happened during the with the 14th Amendment.

323
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,840
But here, let's go back to the what is it the right to hire if you're big, a company that gets

324
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,320
the government to have to have an affirmative act. Yeah, right. So from this person who was

325
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,200
part of the studies, black men, he basically said that affirmative action all the meetings

326
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,600
that because this went on for years before they put it in place. I think it was LBJ put it in,

327
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,680
right? Or Nixon, I think it was LBJ. The Civil Rights Act that was passed immediately after

328
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,740
Kennedy's assassination was yeah. So yeah, so this anyway, by the way, that's a minor thing.

329
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,260
But the reason why they did that, because they noticed that Americans after World War Two had a

330
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:39,120
big boom in industry. But they had a run of about 10 or 12 years of that boom. And then they started

331
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,760
noticing they were falling behind in engineering and business principles and all this. And they

332
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,660
looked at themselves and they said, Well, just a bunch of middle aged white guys. The reason why

333
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,840
we're falling behind is because we need some cultural diversity. We need some new blood in here

334
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,840
because that white bread, middle age, you know, 35 to 55 year old white guy, grown American

335
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,200
is stagnant. So we need to bring people in here from Asia from, you know, from everywhere,

336
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,620
you know, Europe, African continent, whatever, whatever, Latin America to liven it up and spice

337
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:18,340
up because we're losing our industrial advantage. It was not because Oh, look at these, quote unquote,

338
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,240
minorities, you know, we they have to the goodness of our heart, we're gonna give them

339
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,160
an extra. Yeah, it was not out of the goodness at all. It was because they knew that if they

340
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,000
didn't do that, they would fall so far behind. It would be like, what do you call it when you

341
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,880
have inbreeding, right? Oh, yeah. But yeah, it was a mental inbreeding. They were suffering and

342
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,900
they knew it and they had they were wise enough to see it then. It was like the it was almost

343
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,260
like the opposite of the woke movement in a way they wanted to firm things up, not loosen things

344
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,460
up. But the other comment he made was the civil rights movement destroyed the black community

345
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,320
potential of the black community in America, because no one ever talked about when you hear

346
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,060
about the black communities in America, the first thing the average American goes to their mind is

347
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:09,880
to the ghettos. They never talk about the affluent black communities like Mariana, Georgia, and Kew

348
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,120
Gardens and Queens and all these other places, right? For your forest. So nowadays, they never

349
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,840
to Chicago is the first place usually, and then it's on to another urban area where

350
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,000
there is high crime, etc, etc. That's where their initial thing is.

351
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,140
It gets never talking in the American mind and media never show the affluent black communities

352
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,840
never, not at all, always the ghetto and when and the hip hop music is the culture, right?

353
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,420
And all this so that so he's like, Oh, my gosh, all this. He was correct. He says when the silver,

354
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,520
they're going to show the worst of the worst. And that's going to become the culture. And you know

355
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,080
what, he was right. He's very unhappy man. And he's in his 80s. Now, I guess about it. He saw

356
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,740
a different vision back in the 60s, when we were shown that in the 60s, it was so right. So look,

357
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,980
they're beating black folk up, you know, sick and dogs on them and stuff and fire hoses, right?

358
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,960
He says, that's not really what's going on. This is that's not really how we're heading. And that's

359
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,320
how we really are. You know, a bunch of protesting people were up and they're up and rising that,

360
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,860
you know, the developing communities, you never hear about that. Or you hear about,

361
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,780
oh, we can't go to schools, white folk, and we can't send the buses that and by the way,

362
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,940
the Rosa Parks thing is bullshit. There's always been over 100 people that have done that. But Rosa

363
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,880
Parks was the one right? She's like the George Floyd. You know what I mean? For some reason?

364
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,080
Yeah. Yeah. So all this stuff. It's fake. Are you surprised that we're getting a fake story

365
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,760
and all this stuff? By the way, just to bounce back, I should have started with this, the American

366
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,520
slave that they show you a black man in chains with marks on his back, right? You know, there

367
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,780
were black slave owners that had black slaves. Yes, of course. Yeah. And there were affluent

368
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:59,200
black communities in America in since the late 1600s 1700s affluent blacks here that own black

369
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,340
slaves. Yes. And also slavery wasn't on the black market. It wasn't like they're shown today. You

370
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:10,380
know, it was, you know, it was a it was just like the way you go cop an eight ball. Right?

371
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,159
Two levels of it, just like pretty much like you have pharmaceuticals today,

372
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,020
you can get your heroin in a pill form through the pharmacy, or you can go by dope.

373
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,360
You know, right. And when I say black market, no pun intended, it was actually done in a secret

374
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:31,340
way. They were trafficked. Basically, it was human trafficking to the extreme. Right? Of course.

375
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,880
Yeah, and indentured servitude was also a form of slavery, which is slavery. And they were

376
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,320
put there. That's where you get the term white trash from. By the way, it's from the indentured

377
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,219
servants. They're mostly whites, and Irish that came over and all that. Right. So you had a

378
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:52,159
contract. Yeah, contract. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And you had to work and but yeah, and you

379
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,080
had it was 10%. You gave 10% of everything you produced, you know, and now it's like, well,

380
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,820
IRS wants 30%. So, oh, my gosh. Yeah. So you're far worse off in many ways. The only way that I

381
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,180
see people being better off as information exchange, but they're not doing anything with

382
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:17,660
it. They're just so subdued. You know? No, that's why I think you'll actually enjoy the Jones

383
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,660
plantation thing. So yeah, someone brought it up to me a few years ago. I kind of glanced at it.

384
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,500
But yeah, I'll take a look at it. newer version of it. I think you'll you'll appreciate it.

385
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,300
Like I said, I'll hook you up with that afterwards. But this concept, this idea of

386
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,460
free range slavery is something I've talked about for several years. And it's very difficult for

387
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,460
people to wrap their minds around it. Because no, I have choices. But you and I have been over this

388
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,620
about the choices, right? With that are being presented to people. We've been through.

389
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,900
Well, it's not it's Yes. And you know, hold on. This is the choice. The choice is,

390
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,560
are you doing a restricted endorsement? You know, with conditions? Or are you doing unrestricted

391
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,960
endorsement? unconditional? In other words, when something is brought forward to you,

392
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,320
whether it's legal, commercial, religious, are you just unconditionally accepting it?

393
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,120
Or are you looking at it and saying, Well, I might go down that route under these conditions

394
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,760
are met, or I'm restricting this, this and that. By the way, there's a lady who was part of you

395
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,440
know, the Patriot movement, you know, your straw man and all that stuff years ago,

396
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,960
the 30s started, they didn't know, they were very effective in the 90s. And the Jesuits came over

397
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,480
and said, Oh, your judges get beaten up by these patriots, just ignore them, throw them in jail,

398
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,640
right? The legal fiction thing. Actually, I don't have to appear in the court.

399
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,960
That stuff. Well, the one of the ladies knew that it was really they were cracking down on it just

400
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,840
to maintain power. But she knew she stuck to her guns. I forgot her name, Tammy something.

401
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,360
This is in the early 2000s. She gave a lecture on this. Even in prison. It's a contract when they

402
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,680
went into went into prison, it would jail ship to the prison, you have to sign a new contract,

403
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,160
which basically says they retain the right to do that under 14th Amendment, which basically says,

404
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:03,060
or 13th Amendment, and 14. There's no more slavery, right? Just citizenship. And if you're

405
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,780
convicted of a crime, you know, right, you're it's slavery is basically allowed. So she went through

406
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,560
and started crossing. They give her something like 17 years she had to do or 12 years.

407
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,240
She started crossing out all the stuff in the prison contracts that put in a cell by herself

408
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,520
and two attorneys came in and said, Well, we saw what you did to the paperwork. So you'll be out in

409
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,680
60 days. Wow, you know, and nothing to do with seeing the judge what he has to say or no,

410
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,280
she just started crossing stuff out on the paperwork. Right? Amazing, right?

411
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,520
Well, definitely. Because it's mind blowing that you know, you can get out of that because

412
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,940
you'd simply didn't endorse stuff, which is Yeah, that's right. She started making restrict the same
