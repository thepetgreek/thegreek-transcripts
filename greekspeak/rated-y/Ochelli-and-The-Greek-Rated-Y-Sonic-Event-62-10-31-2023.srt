Okay, now, a note for the listener on the Pope's work schedule, it is what they call Halloween.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,520
Yeah, Salon.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,300
Yeah, Salon.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,880
Day of the Dead.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,860
Day of the Dead.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,780
Interesting, interesting thing there because I asked you about, you know, some other customs

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,439
out there where people get dressed up and whatnot but it is it is one of these

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,780
things that's happened throughout different cultures but this is one of

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,600
those things that prevails now I wonder you know how is it that you interpret

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,020
what you see regarding this you know saw one day of the dead transitional time

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,700
period I mean it is in the fall after all but yeah I'm gonna go back to the

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,020
the archaics Jason Brashear's he's brought up something interesting that I

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,620
might have seen in passing but he nailed it a little bit more that was one

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,020
you know in Genesis everything was created in the second verse everything

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,360
is dark and void and destroyed right that happened around this time it's also

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
in many cultures it would be around what we call the ninth month or this time

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,760
where the fall after the ingathering in most cultures the fall was the

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
ingathering that's when you knew how well I was gonna say how rich you were

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,520
but yeah in the fall as you is when you did all the accounting for all of your

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
assets just like in a lot of in the corporate world it's September is when

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,740
their financial year ends or you know they pushed it out to the regular

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,720
calendar and they do quarters but it used to be that you knew what you were

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,000
worth by the end of the fall and when they did that in ancient culture they

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,460
were all completely destroyed by the way in that culture if you harken back to

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,880
Jeremiah and all that wait it doesn't mention that tohu wohu again total

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,400
destruction it was very advanced culture much more advanced than we are right now

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,540
you know so in other words you'd have like remember back to the future of the

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,220
hoverboard right that's how they got around you know hoverboards and baby

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,440
strollers were hovering and stuff like that it was all they didn't have an

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,980
infrastructure like this and ever since then I think I've gotten into a little

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,080
bit how the atom that we talked about mostly that was the dumbed-down version

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,160
of humanity you know eighth David eighth day man right pathetic creature right it

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,180
was a right where the man on sixth day was not at all he actually got a

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,100
blessing and so yeah it goes back into that I believe that if you look

37
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,440
cross-culturally around this time that would be fairly accurate to what we could

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,380
bring forward not accurate like we know but accurate in terms of what could be

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:46,460
forward by consensus of ancient collections Ritz even according to the

40
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,420
people it's pretty strange nowadays because I remember some years ago there

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,720
was this discussion about levitation being a more common thing that could be

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,580
achieved by earlier societies which totally explained you know how is it

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,420
that they got the giant stones to be moved here or there and these different

44
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,460
places etc etc and the weird thing is even the woo-woo among us right you know

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,720
the ones who come up with all kinds of fanciful explanations of everything they

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,680
never talk about that anymore they don't even mention that there might have

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,060
been levitation actually and yet no no they don't even talk about what happened

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,580
two weeks ago no but by the way since you're mentioning levitation I just want

49
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,620
to bring this in is a I had a personal talk today for two and a half hours with

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Kurt Hallberg who's who's he water world watch Rico realize he's been working on

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,980
Victor Shaw burger stuff since 1996 he's an engineer he's in his late 60s or mid

52
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,840
60s and he's in Sweden and Sam got us together because I brought up Malmo

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,520
Sweden it was pretty big let's say 10-15 years ago people in Sweden and Olaf

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,320
Alexanderson people are familiar with Victor Shaw burger right you could look

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,600
him up and since you brought up levitation I'll just want to insert this

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,080
will be interesting for those I believe that but by the way I've been having

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,260
some private Skype calls with some some of our subs and they're really a good

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,340
bunch of people by the way you know I'm very happy so that's why I'm

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,459
suggesting that most people would well presuming know who Victor Shaw burger

60
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,820
would be and we think of Victor Shaw burger now you get like kind of a neo

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,620
Nazi thing that he made flying saucers and all that right yeah that's that's a

62
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,100
common reference right yeah right but the thing that he had written was about

63
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,540
how one of the devices broke free from a table it was bolted down with six

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,100
quarter-inch bolts which takes you know several more than several tons to break

65
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,160
that free and levitate so we got into a conversation about water he's a seasoned

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
individual in the field and knows a lot he spends time at the Victor Shaw burger

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,080
mansion the PKS Institute in Austria so we got into the secret part the part

68
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,820
about Shaw burger that you won't find in books the part about Shaw burger that

69
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,880
you won't find on the internet and I think some of the people listening here

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,860
might have enough interest and if you've never heard of Victor Shaw burger this

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,120
would actually fill in what I just said stuff you will not find anywhere because

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,540
you brought up levitation my mind I wanted to bring him up anyway for two

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,440
things one about the emo and one of what I'm about to say now regarding the

74
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,600
secrets of Shaw burger right and one thing he asked me says have you heard of

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,920
Shaw burger cement as in cement right and and I was like no what is it so

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,220
basically it's three materials a quartz silica very fine colloidal very fine

77
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,760
aluminum powder and what's called water glass which is like a silica again gel

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,500
they use it water glass is like a very it's clear as water it's real thick

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,280
syrup back from the 1930s to the 1970s if you had a hole in your car radiator

80
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,120
you pour this stuff in and when it leaked out it dried and made a seal right but it

81
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
is water-soluble yeah that's another thing that has actually kind of

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,720
disappeared from a bunch of industrial things I know that was in use for a

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,900
bunch of reasons this sort of weird stuff that would kind of go into a gap

84
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,260
fill it it was like yeah I almost thought that's what they were

85
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,420
introducing when they put out that new sealant stuff in a can that they've been

86
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,740
making you know big way they're doing it but with plastics because the bad thing

87
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,000
about the water glass is if you wet the radiator from the outside like drove

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,100
through a you know the rain or hosed it down it would break and you have to do

89
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,960
it again because it is water-soluble but it's slightly water-resistant but

90
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,780
anyway what they what they did with this material Shawberger did he made like a

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,380
cement of it and like a putty it would almost look like modeling clay and when

92
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,540
he built his devices he would coat them with this cement right so it would almost

93
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,580
look like one of those mud brick ovens right okay and that's how he got some of

94
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,620
the effects and the reason I'm bringing this up is it's a very clandestine group

95
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,880
the Shawberger group they speak only German they are you know it's a they they

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,820
spend their time in the basement of the place you know where Shawberger you know

97
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,720
the things they don't bring out into the public at all this is not in any of the

98
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,180
books or any of the internet so I just thought I'd bring that out the other

99
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,880
thing I want to bring out about speaking with Kurt Halberg is he mentioned some

100
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,240
dowsing but no dowsing that you know is unusual you call it the emotional dowsing

101
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,300
I was like oh you know I'm being quiet here you know because it's emo work

102
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,040
right and I said what do you mean by that he said well you're out in a field

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,060
and you lose your wallet you want to find your wallet so what you do is you

104
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,720
go to the edge of the field and you start thinking about your wallet you

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,060
know how it feels how it looks how it smells every how it you know touch

106
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,020
everything about it and you bring up the emotions that you experience when you

107
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,760
think of the wallet how it looks how it feels and all that and you do that for a

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,200
few minutes and then you take out some dowsing rods and immediately the

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,940
dowsing rods will point exactly to your what where your wallet is and I was

110
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,420
like funny you should mention that because I've been doing he's more

111
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,040
telling people that the emo work can be turned into affecting your physical real

112
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,460
world and become practical instead of hearing about a mild-mannered guy who

113
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,420
shot five people because he went into an emotional tizzy right and how we're

114
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,380
never told what the purpose of emotions are but we're always right considering

115
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,100
them and no it's almost like you don't know what that thing is you know you

116
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,040
imagine going into a place where these objects someone works with every day and

117
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,360
you well this thanks for bringing me to where you work what's this and he says I

118
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,360
don't know is it we've been working here 40 years you don't know what that is

119
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,100
Wow you know you see what I mean right that's how the emotions are for people

120
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,960
if you ask them what they are well you know they'll say well their emotions you

121
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,180
know you know emotions and it's a buzz far as they go so I thought those two

122
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,480
points were very interesting I wanted to bring them up and what prompted just the

123
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,100
the initial the rapid insert is that you brought up levitation so no no problem

124
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,880
look it makes perfect sense too because I mean I've known people that have

125
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,560
lived in neighborhoods for years where there's a distinct smell that like kind

126
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,340
of hangs over the area they have no idea what it is where it comes from

127
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,260
nothing they just know it's there they know it doesn't yeah it doesn't take

128
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,040
well we spoke on one of the Sonics about interest you should be interested in

129
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,800
everything what what you invest your time in you know ergo your career or

130
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,640
whatever is different but you hear people say you know I've covered this

131
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,980
many times you know well I'm not into math I'm not good at math you know so

132
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,500
and they leave it as such for the rest of their life right like like it will never

133
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,280
affect them of course it's gonna affect them well I'm not good at this I

134
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,060
don't know anything about electronics right but you're using it all the time

135
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,860
but what's that in your hand right what's that at home what right yeah so

136
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,900
yeah this is where the the service communities take advantage you know the

137
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,920
mechanics right and the reply I remember I got really upset with someone I was

138
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,880
living with we we bought a VCR back in the late 80s for about 70 bucks and it

139
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,640
stopped working and without telling me person took the VCR the next day to a

140
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,080
repair shop and so where's the VCR so what's not working so I took a repair

141
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,660
shop so I'll go get a repair shop but he wants $95 because he examined it and he

142
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,040
says it's really it's gonna be 250 to fix and I'm like I paid 75 bucks for it

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm not gonna spend another 300 and he demanded his $95 you know and I'm like

144
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,900
oh my gosh I just got ripped off right right you see you know same with cars

145
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,880
I've had a neighbor who spent $700 on a tune-up but look at the car was it was

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,260
disgustingly dirty there's no way they tuned that up right this has been good

147
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,740
you know calling doctors right I just lawyers I just had a conversation

148
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,060
yesterday with somebody he says oh yeah I had to go get an oil change I spent

149
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:48,660
$90 I said what I said what are you spending $90 on an oil change for 90

150
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,800
bucks but here here Chuck really know the realistically realistically that

151
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,460
should be the price of an oil change to do a quality job well by the way so when

152
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,940
you hear about the cheap oil changes or when you do yourself I understand but

153
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,120
you know it's 100 bucks an hour you know for somebody to do service now yeah but

154
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,460
it does a it doesn't take that long be it's look you buy it yourself you can do

155
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,680
it yourself it's not that big a deal no but for many it is like for example give

156
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,760
me an example right now I'm in a situation where I could fix anything

157
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,600
right and I'm not bragging in a situation where if I had a chain if you

158
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,280
told me go change the oil in the car that you're using must be changed

159
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,920
tomorrow I won't do it I'll take it somewhere because I don't have the time I

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,760
just don't have the time right right I'm just involved with so many things and

161
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,700
what you know the water project so yeah one thing I also wanted to bring up that

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,360
I was thinking about I was having a conversation with individual about the

163
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,800
difference between intent and will okay think about that there is a difference

164
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,720
there yeah okay so difference in the simplest way from Greek in Greek speak

165
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,040
fashion is very simple okay intent is something that is exercised when you're

166
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,280
conscious awake thinking but will is always being exercised even when you're

167
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,960
asleep and unconscious it's still there hmm think about that for a moment we

168
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,560
don't need to get into that subject but I just might be sure I repeat it no I

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,260
like it because it look it's it sounds awfully oversimplified but it really

170
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,500
isn't it is it is very oversimplified but if you learn that you will sense the

171
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,020
difference between your intent and your will right and you will be able to

172
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,500
manage it a little bit better remember we say if you can't measure you can't

173
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,640
manage it if you don't know what the thing is how are you gonna manage it

174
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,020
right you should have the ability to wield both of them to some degree right

175
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,960
I mean it's not as though one of them is out of your control either is it well

176
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,780
the conditions are different if you go let's go that's repeated intent is

177
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,800
something that you exercise right when you're conscious awake during your

178
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,260
waking hours day but will is something that is constantly being exercised even

179
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,860
when you're asleep it's still active right where your intent is not but your

180
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,460
intent would influence your will would it not and actually the other way around

181
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,840
it's the other way around okay so I will is a very sure a will is something that

182
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,140
the body's mind takes part of I think we got got into a little bit about some

183
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:19,080
let's say take a typical suicidal case right a person is disenchanted with life

184
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,200
wants to die yeah while they're killing themselves they're there they just put up

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
with it and go for but the body's like don't kill me you know the body it's

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,100
conscious itself the part of the body that runs the heart the lungs the

187
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,500
metabolism does all the epithelial cell apoptosis all the natural functions the

188
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,840
body has its own mind you know every five times a second this all the cells

189
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,780
all the brain we're okay and every five times a second their brain asks the

190
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,120
cells are you okay you know like the like the switch I turn the switch on off

191
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,140
on off but you turn the switch off on off on right these complex things right

192
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,660
that's the mind the body of the mind so while this person is killing themselves

193
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,040
yes the body's like don't kill me don't kill me through this and we went through

194
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,860
this in both directions actually because the body also you see people that just

195
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,980
shut down after a while that's it the body just gives up well that's it well

196
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,120
just that's see one is the intent to kill oneself but the will of the body is

197
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,180
still there right so but but the can will be diminished well in the suicide

198
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,620
of course yes but in the suicide I'm just using the suicide case as an example

199
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,040
please don't know doesn't apply no no it can go in the other direction as well

200
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,880
where somebody has the intent to continue living but the will goes the

201
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,060
other way they die in their sleep I mean sure sure sure sure well that's

202
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,020
that's when you know people that's when they say they died happy mm-hmm right

203
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,120
they were ready you're ready to go but aside from death let's just say in a

204
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,680
functional situation right because that by the way death can be very functional

205
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,120
but it's quickly becomes dysfunctional non-functional I should say in a sense

206
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,680
intent is where you focus it's like the fine-tuning of a radio station and

207
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,180
dialing in the radio station but will is what volume you play that does that

208
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,940
help okay yeah right so you could play the say so your intent is you're moving

209
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,300
around all the bands you I want to listen to you k-rock or whatever right

210
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,000
or 101.7 where oh no I know I don't like that let's go to the next one let's go

211
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,480
to 95.7 let's try that one okay that was good that was good okay that's all your

212
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,260
intent moving around the dial but once you land on on that with intent now it's

213
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,580
like how loud are we gonna play it are we gonna make it really low background

214
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,560
are we gonna turn it up and jam yeah that's your will in my mind those things

215
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,120
are absolutely reversed normally that's their reverse they're exactly the

216
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,100
inverse of each other so okay I just I have to switch it around because the

217
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,640
will you don't have to do anything I'm just bringing this up because these are

218
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,220
things that no one talks about oh no I got you I'm just the way that I think of

219
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,760
it though is I would consider the will exactly the intent in the intent

220
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,440
exactly the will the way you're describing it but I don't know why that

221
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,620
well that's like that well that gets into the conundrum of the soul and the spirit

222
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,680
you look up spirit it says it's a soul and you look up soul it says it's the

223
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,760
spirit right there it's a con game right so anyway I'm not saying it's a con

224
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,660
game that if you believe the opposite but I'm just bringing this up because

225
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,340
it's thought for food yeah well no it's not like a belief like I have this

226
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,960
belief it's just that I thought that that's the way it was you know well this

227
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,600
is an outline to bring up so you can measure it because remember if you can't

228
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,580
measure it you can't manage it can you manage your intent can you manage your

229
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,880
will of course mm-hmm right well like I said one one works with the other it does

230
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,400
in a certain way because it can it can it doesn't have to it doesn't have to by

231
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,920
the way doesn't the will is almost autopilot yeah think about you've got

232
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,080
your car on cruise control that would be the will right versus versus you know

233
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,640
cruise control now you if you don't push that pedal the car slows down if

234
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,900
you push it too much it speeds up right and you also use the brake right so yeah

235
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:05,319
intent is the finer aspects of direction and will is the general overview of the

236
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,900
drive and the amplitude and here's the thing the important part that people

237
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,020
might say that I didn't go into is why is the wheel operating when you're

238
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,940
unconscious and asleep well that's just a really big question also and I'm

239
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,339
looking into that and now let me just suggest this or take it for what it's

240
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,020
worth and you're doing the JFK risk research you will probably understand

241
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,540
what I'm trying to say all the intelligence agencies throughout the

242
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,360
past 75 years really 50 years by you know when I say 50 years that's 1973 right

243
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,720
this makes me feel old 60 years since the event now just about yeah yeah but

244
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,940
I'm saying it's for 50 since best let's say 40 years they've been all the

245
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,820
intelligence agencies and somehow been publishing papers on consciousness you

246
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,760
know the woo-woo and right like the X-Files type stuff right and more and

247
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,980
more actually let's just be a little more accurate for people in the past

248
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,300
three years it's been more and more right three to five years so what they

249
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,280
all agreed on would take it however you want to take it you know is they said

250
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,400
that they from studying people our consciousness it they have evidence it

251
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,360
believes they believe more than presuming that when we're asleep our

252
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,080
consciousness is being used somewhere else and the will maintains that all

253
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,980
right the will is still there with us when we're somewhere else I'll leave it

254
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,060
at that because now the rest of it I'm gonna have to confabulate I really

255
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,360
haven't put together anything that I can really talk about regarding that well

256
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,820
you'd have a landscape of all the different influences because here you

257
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,380
are you're subject to external we talked about this before you're subject to

258
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,540
external input at this point you're always yeah but hold on this is also

259
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,780
external output because if you're being used somewhere else when you're asleep

260
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,980
you've just outputted yourself to where somewhere else like okay this is not a

261
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,920
play on words let's do a play on words since I said somewhere else you ready

262
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,060
okay okay let's say you and I are in the studio in the same room right sure and

263
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,220
I'm gonna say Chuck I'm gonna prove to you that I'm not here use and you're

264
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,260
gonna say okay that's funny how are you gonna do that are you standing right in

265
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,020
front of me right I can see I can hear you I can reach out over here and touch

266
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,320
you so I using using just legally I can prove to you that I'm not here using

267
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,200
words right okay so we're in front of each other right now and Chuck I'm gonna

268
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,680
prove to you that I'm not here you say okay go ahead so am I in Philadelphia

269
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,980
well no let's say we're where were you are right now we're in the union where

270
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,720
you're you're in my office you're making Georgia we're together yeah there you go

271
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,100
I'm in making George so am I in Philadelphia no okay so I must be

272
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,760
somewhere else okay so am I in Chicago no all right my in New York no all right

273
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,820
so if I'm not in Philadelphia I'm not in Chicago I'm not in New York I must be

274
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,100
somewhere else so if I'm somewhere else how can I be here well I would say that

275
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,840
somewhere else could be here it's just not described because somewhere else is

276
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,620
under is not right with the description but you see how it goes both ways if I'm

277
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,000
telling you I'm somewhere else just audibly even then I can't be here well

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,900
somewhere else yeah okay so you defined yourself as being somewhere else well

279
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,420
it's this let's go back to the consciousness thing if someone is

280
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,980
sleeping they're still here aren't they yes right but they're not here not

281
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,700
entirely no all right so what is the person the consciousness or is it just

282
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,260
the bag of meat and flesh the meat popsicle which one is it well on so it's

283
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,240
both yeah yeah okay so so in this case it's both so yes they're here but

284
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,540
they're also not here just like I've the what the joke that I just did with

285
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,440
you I'm both there but I'm but my words just show you through reasoning that I'm

286
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
not there just by you admitting that I'm somewhere else so it's very similar yeah

287
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,180
well silly question even awake right normal time of the day not sleeping and

288
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,460
you're awake how about this your mind wanders they say your mind you got your

289
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,280
mind somewhere else you got your mind on something else your mind is not

290
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,960
necessarily always with you either is okay stop stop right there that's your

291
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,040
intent but your will is still the same so give you an example let's just break it

292
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,840
down let's say you use basic slave talk I want to buy a new car I can't afford I'm

293
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,400
gonna get a second job so I'm gonna get a second job so when I come home from I

294
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,700
do my nine to five I go home for half an hour then I work from five to ten okay

295
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,320
another five hours every day right this has been done by actually remember back

296
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,800
in the days people did this they wanted to buy a new Z a new Camaro right is I

297
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,580
might get a second job and in a year I'll you know I'm like okay you're gonna

298
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,960
you know you know work like that you know 16 17 hours a day you can do that

299
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,520
by the way instead of going home and watching TV and recreating just

300
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,900
constantly be working right might as well so I'm gonna get a second job so

301
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,740
now I met this job from my you know nine to five and now I'm at this other job

302
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,960
from five to ten every day during the week right okay and after like a week of

303
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,820
doing this I'm getting kind of tired of it and when instead of while I'm doing

304
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,260
what I'm supposed to be doing my mind is going somewhere else right but I'm still

305
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,900
at the job right right okay my intent my one when we say my mind is somewhere

306
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,280
else because obviously I didn't expect it would be so boring or you know

307
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,420
whatever you know it's easy to drift away because it's a second job is it

308
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,360
taking the best of you let's say but so you know you're not performing exactly

309
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,840
what you should be doing or maybe you are but you physically being at the job

310
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,780
as part of the will that you established you're doing this why because you want

311
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,640
to make enough money to buy that new Z by the way that's a Camaro z28 and for

312
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,980
people you know that's the old thing but yeah I got yeah but this is what I'm

313
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,040
this is actually almost like a true story this is like talking about 1980s

314
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,100
early 80s man I sound old some people and people are born in the 80s you know

315
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,720
I know it's so weird I'm thinking to myself I was doing something like this

316
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,440
somewhere in the 90s so I could buy the girlfriend a car and I was working a

317
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,060
security job extra aside from my regular work and that was you know four

318
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,800
or five hours at a clip and quite honestly the security job was me mostly

319
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,820
just doing nothing actually just being present right so you so the will was

320
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,720
doing the job to do to get money by the girlfriend a car but the while you were

321
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,440
there your intent was floating around oh yeah I was reading books there's another

322
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,340
example of what we're talking about okay okay does that make sense see there's

323
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,720
many ways and here's the thing I haven't prepared I've been thinking about this

324
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,700
for a little while now and I'm like I have to present this point because you've

325
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,740
gone through the emo this ties into the emo because the emo will not override

326
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,140
your will once the will is established and the other thing it can if you

327
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,600
understand how to use the emo because then you're talking about a higher level

328
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:59,160
of emotional demand and projection anyway you know I wasn't planning on

329
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,540
talking but here's the thing and I got to be honest like a lot of people say I

330
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,560
don't want to go on anymore about this because I really don't want to

331
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,200
confabulate I don't I have to really think about this and do some research on

332
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,800
the way I do research on these things you know you always should go back to

333
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,920
what the professionals are saying which as as I get older I'm realizing like

334
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,400
let's say years ago you want to know something about like whatever we're

335
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,060
talking about the mind so let's go see what the psychiatrists and psychologists

336
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,800
have written about it you might get something right now when I go back let's

337
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,900
say oh it's all junk all of it it's crazy no it's all crap and you know what

338
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,560
the best the best of anything is something that's nothing original you

339
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,240
know very much metaphorically Hollywood is the same thing well it doesn't have to

340
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,560
be original no but it's if they're all if they're all saying the same thing and

341
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,920
it's true and it works it's fine right but they're not even doing that but

342
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,140
that's great but what I'm saying is when you're talking about expanding the pool

343
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,100
of knowledge and trying to reach for something new you know going to strange

344
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,280
new worlds like they would in Star Trek they don't it's well if you want

345
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,060
something really new you got to go back to get it's got to be very old if it's

346
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,640
going to be very new because everything that there's nothing really new under

347
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
the Sun so you know how you always say if you want a new idea read an old book

348
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,560
yeah but that's what but even from that point they're failing miserably it's just

349
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,740
trash so with this what I mean when I say I'm gonna do research it's actually I'm

350
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,100
gonna just be looking at several things on what's been put out about this and by

351
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,020
the way it's minimal like the emo work I said let me let me just see what

352
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,940
convention has because I had a conversation one of our subs it was he

353
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,780
posts and on the chat and all that and he's wonderful person that was so glad

354
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,740
we've had some skypes and he brought up someone that I've never heard before and

355
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,520
this person other people have heard of them I brought him up in another

356
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,160
conversation recently Gilbert Ling and he had written he had proposed Gilbert

357
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,240
Ling he's passed away now he I hope I got his name right he proposed that the

358
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,080
way cells interact and move and grow and expel things is by induction and not by

359
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,300
the direct chemical exposure expulsion method that we've been told you know

360
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,160
absorption through the entire you know he believed in he proposed theories that

361
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,640
everything in the body works by it's a closed system and it works by induction

362
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,160
go figure I'd never heard of them before when they actually have shown

363
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,320
this stuff I don't see you know now that I have thought about that deeply and I

364
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,780
think back to the things I've witnessed already you know I talked to you before

365
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,060
about how they are able to photograph things that are being seen through a

366
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,240
microscope right and I'm thinking about how stuff was done microscopically it

367
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,040
isn't like a direct feed there isn't something coming from one place to

368
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,100
another where you can like see it being sent by a tube from one cell to another

369
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,320
no but it does happen let me just and this is the converse part of the

370
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,720
conversation this might enlighten people because there's always the duality side

371
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,260
this is this ends the duality and shows the firmness of the induction let me

372
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,420
just get into this there's videos of like you said microscopic where a cell

373
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,640
is ready to expel something from the protoplasm right right so what it does is

374
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,540
inside the cell it forms a material that's just like the membrane and then

375
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,940
that bubble of stuff goes to the edge of the membrane and the membrane opens to it

376
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,880
and it's like a cul-de-sac and it spits the stuff out right right and then it

377
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,480
closes again and that's true that will happen but what I use this analogy

378
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,100
that's not always happening it's mostly by induction is this do you know how

379
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,680
they always say that blood cells are created in the bone marrow it's true

380
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,600
they did a study but under normal conditions they're not right in other

381
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,500
words the study that they did to determine that blood cells are created in

382
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,820
the bone marrow all the people had to be fasting and immobilized now let me

383
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,880
ask you this the normal everyday life are you immobilized and fasting that's

384
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,380
not normal just like blood pressure measurement is not normal you don't you

385
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,380
don't walk around with pressure you know unless your pants are too tight right

386
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,540
you don't put a tight cuff right it's an it's art of completely artificial the

387
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,580
when they determined they had that little microscopic video of the cell let me ask

388
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,820
you this what is that a normal condition for a cell no cell under

389
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,320
stress unusual stress absolutely well yes because it's usually not in wherever

390
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,060
the cell belongs naturally it's never there it's sitting on a slide or it's

391
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,260
sitting in a in a you know think about you like they take you from what you

392
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,540
normally do and put you in a room with bright lights and glass floor and all

393
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,540
that right that's what look the slide is glass right and they put bright lights

394
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,080
and bullies cameras on you is that normal exactly I'm gonna act like you

395
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,640
normally do no no cuz I'm no longer in my natural place see that's the thing

396
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,920
yeah well you got kidnapped you got you've been a bastard you've been

397
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,320
abducted you're not gonna act normally in an abduction so they abducted this

398
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,120
cell right and stressed it right just like the people where they determine the

399
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,300
but the blood comes out of the bone marrow they're immobilized they can't

400
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,400
move and for days and days and they're fasting oh my gosh of course you know of

401
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,240
course the body's gonna act differently so that's the other thing I've always

402
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,360
found interesting where they're like well we have this here and that you know

403
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,900
this cell came from here or wherever and I'm like you took that cell from a dead

404
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,520
body and you're telling me about what the living body does how do you do that if

405
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,560
you're not witnessing it in the living environment I've always had that doesn't

406
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,700
work how does that work and well yeah that's where I went on I said like no

407
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,080
one you know eat oranges got vitamin C no one knows what's in an orange is it

408
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,040
what do you mean no yes they do so well how do they know there's vitamin C in an

409
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,420
orange they take the orange and they crush it completely crush and then they

410
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,160
centerfuge it and then they burn it to get an assay oh really you know all

411
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,160
those processes will change the orange into something completely different so

412
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,860
you really don't know what's in a living orange you really don't but you know

413
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,360
its effects and all that's like the car the conversation with the bear right no

414
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,280
one knows what a bear is what we say we do well even though they say that our

415
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,880
bodies burn calories and burn food here's the fire where's the burn yeah

416
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,420
there's no burn at all that's well because we live in a society that was

417
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,520
developed with fire that's why I use as an analogy imagine a society that was

418
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,160
developed through magnetism instead of fire hmm right you make heat with

419
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,460
magnets you right but not even using the the magnets north-south like right like

420
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,620
most people would imagine by the way right now also we're going through again

421
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,740
another study with the water device on the third component there's a third

422
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,200
fourth fifth and sixth component of a magnet that is not being acknowledged

423
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,320
the fourth component component a third component slightly is it's called the

424
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,260
block wall but there are many others so we can get into that in the future and

425
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,740
I am working on things in the future more like things that I've done in the

426
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,540
past by the way you're always you know when you think about the past or the

427
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,200
future you're still in the past right you can only be in the now for and you

428
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,500
cannot perceive it because it's right when you try to grab it your times

429
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,940
already passed right now for that split second that's that it's gone it's all in

430
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,280
the past so being in the now is the hardest thing forget about the future but

431
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,820
what I brought like for example the aqueous Argentum device I get a message

432
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,020
I wouldn't say every day but just about every day about the excelling the

433
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,240
virtues of it and usually ones that people have made themselves and we're

434
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,580
gonna that has to do with induction by the way because it's not putting any

435
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,700
silver in the water at all right as a matter of fact if you do or if you're

436
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,000
able to measure silver in the water stop using it because it's not right and

437
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,380
it's much more potent and powerful than what they call colloid of silver which I

438
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,520
think is a toxin and it doesn't work well by the way more on that idea

439
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,060
induction simple methods and things so I've been working on that not as much as

440
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,400
I'd like to but I am still working on things like that so just like we brought

441
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,920
forward a few years ago the idea of the aqueous Argentum using a very very low

442
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,440
voltage low current silver electrode to produce you know the essence of silver

443
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,340
and water with no silver in the water at all working on other things for other

444
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,000
biological reasons and things so that's going to be very interesting right and

445
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,820
tell you the truth the one guy that we both know got exactly one from you you

446
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,680
know tells me about it all the time how the winner the winner yes our winner

447
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,920
Joe it has done you know keeps telling me all the time all different things that

448
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,200
this is doing well you didn't even ask for it he didn't ask for it but it's

449
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,900
it's really wild because honestly if you were to show this to somebody who does

450
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,420
make the colloidal silver stuff or believes in that which by the way I know

451
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,340
you see it as a toxin and all that but it has had some positive effects for so

452
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,800
yeah so the thing is though compared to that though like that stuff's crap

453
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,180
compared to what he's getting and meanwhile if you showed it to somebody

454
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,820
who you know is on board with that whole colloidal silver deal they tell you this

455
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,260
isn't doing anything that's right and and here's the thing let's go back to

456
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,440
what you said the coil silver does work but let's use it for an example the the

457
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,780
various ways that Joe is presented that it's been successful regular colloidal

458
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,020
silver would not have been that successful first of all the second

459
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,500
thing when you're using the material silver it's just like drugs what happens

460
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,880
like you take a drug let's say certain antibiotics or painkillers what happens

461
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,360
when you keep using them the body develops a resistance or it stops

462
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,120
working right we'll get just something else right exactly because because it's

463
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,840
a material based thing but if you're using the material silver does the same

464
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,340
thing by the way with the body this doesn't because there's no material

465
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,620
there right that's pure energy it's what the body needs directly versus when you

466
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,920
take the material it's a two-stage process the body sees the material and

467
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,980
what does the body have to do by induction turn it back into energy but if

468
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,400
you're just presenting straight energy right there's no reason to develop a

469
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,760
resistance so there's no no developing tolerance to energy is what what you're

470
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,820
saying sounds like to me no that's right hmm that's interesting because any

471
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,780
other physical thing you know whatever it is food or whatever I mean you're

472
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,700
guys why that's why what do you think about they're not so concerned about

473
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,620
putting fluoride in the water to kill you now if they want to well what are

474
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,840
they to use they're using what kind of weapons right think about energy weapons

475
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,720
energy weapons a lot more efficient because you won't develop a tolerance to

476
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:04,920
it
