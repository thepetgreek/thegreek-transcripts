1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,600
Rated Y number 63 this time, and really quickly, before I even ask the Greek how he's doing,

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,940
I'm going to let you guys know something, just in case you can't figure it out.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,400
We do have a chat room, which you can join.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,000
It has nothing to do with anything, okay, anybody could find it, but generally speaking, you

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,520
guys who are subscribing to this should find it first, and you can easily give feedback

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,940
there.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,800
We do read it.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,060
We do check on it.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,340
The Greek interacts in there a bit more than I do, but I check it out as well, okay?

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,520
Yeah, hold on.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,940
It's ocelliandthegreek.chatango.com is what you're talking about.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,040
That's what I'm talking about.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
It's a completely separate entity.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,340
It's just like YouTube would be separate and anything else.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,240
It's ocelliandthegreek.chatango.com.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,480
Right, but for you as a subscriber, you could go there and give us some feedback.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,420
If there's something that you want heard on here, you want mentioned, you want discussed,

18
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,560
we do read it, and reasonable requests and things that are being discussed in there do

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
get discussed on Rated Y.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,520
Just wanted to let you know.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,960
One more time, ocelliandthegreek, all spelled out, one word, .chatango, C-H-A-T-A-N-G-O.com.

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,360
That is where you can go and interact in there.

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,460
It's its own entity, yeah.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,980
Someone else runs it.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,060
I think I have admin privileges there.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,140
You might too, but we don't actually own it or anything.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,040
It's just there.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,320
It's a free, open source kind of thing.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,720
Just all of that out there, that's what it is, and obviously, you would have already

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,900
gone to the Patreon by now and signed up because that's the only way you got this one, okay?

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:54,960
So anyway, back to it, Greek, often people do give us some interesting hints about things

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,580
that do need to be revealed because although they seem to be commonplace in the world,

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,180
and people get awfully emotionally attached to things, they are wildly misunderstood.

34
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,419
Yeah, the bread.

35
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,220
Bread, we were talking about.

36
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Yeah, money used to be ... Yeah, what I mentioned we'll get into tonight.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,260
I had a Skype with someone who's a sub.

38
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,240
He's got an academic background in physics, engineering, so forth, and I brought up some

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,640
terms that I thought people kind of know, and he says, why don't you do a Sonic on finance?

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,720
By the way, it's called ... Most people call it finance, but when you have a lot of it,

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,780
you call it finance.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,980
Oh, okay.

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,620
Excuse me.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, right.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,640
I never have a lot of it, so I don't know.

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,420
I'll tell you something else.

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,280
I was thinking bread.

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,980
It's kind of funny.

49
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,140
You and I are old enough to remember when that was very commonplace.

50
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,260
You go to get your bread.

51
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,040
Later on, it might have been knots, or stacks, or paper, or whatever, a lot of street parlance

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,560
for what is it?

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,240
Money, supposedly, right?

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,100
But you're talking about finance, and to me, money and finance are different things, although

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,040
they are involved with one another, but then again, I'm not saying I fully understand it.

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,720
Well, everyone thinks we're in capitalism.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,680
You could go back and forth with various systems, but the Soviet Union and most communist countries

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,760
as known historically never really used Marx's principles as he suggested they should be,

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
or Engel, right?

60
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,320
Because those principles are actually not even anti ... Actually, they're very capitalistic

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,080
to a degree.

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
Well, that's the weird thing.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,940
The history ...

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,040
Yeah.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
That's the weird thing, like China right now, right?

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Everybody goes, well, it's the communist, and yes, indeed it is.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
The communist party, right?

68
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
The CCP, or whatever.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,020
In name only.

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,000
They only use what they think people think communism is against, as a ... Right.

71
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, but oddly enough, they do behave quite a bit like capitalists do.

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
They do have private entities.

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,800
They have a middle class that's actually rising a lot quicker than the rest.

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
Statistically, which country has the most billionaires?

76
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,900
China.

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,540
China.

78
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:10,640
China.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,140
Do they?

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,900
Which country has the most millionaires?

82
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,900
China.

83
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, I thought we had the most millionaires.

84
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:17,620
No?

85
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,060
Well, 30 years ago.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah.

87
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,500
In the we, of course, we.

88
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, right.

89
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,880
Anyway, the United States, I thought had the most, but ...

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,300
All right.

91
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,860
Let me just give you a quick example.

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,920
Here we have the University of Arizona in Tucson, and the better Chinese restaurants,

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,100
the students that are over here from China go and eat there, right?

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,880
Because it reminds them of home.

95
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,420
Well, they have quarter of a million dollar cars.

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,880
They're 18 year old students, 19 year old, right?

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,480
And they're driving $150,000, $200,000 cars.

98
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,460
Talking about-

99
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,620
So, do the math, you know?

100
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,760
I mean, their pops is a millionaire, right?

101
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,300
Or their moms?

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,120
Has to be.

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,840
You're not driving a $250,000 ... You're not driving a car which is worth more than some

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,620
people's houses.

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,060
Yeah, it's the first.

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,420
Well, the average house price in Arizona used to be around $250,000, now it's $450,000.

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,280
Same house.

108
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,900
Over a period of two years, so it's kind of artificial.

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,520
We'll get into why these things happen.

110
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,120
No problem.

111
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,180
It's the same.

112
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,760
They're driving half a house then.

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,580
Even so, it's still pretty hefty.

114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:21,980
Yeah.

115
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,820
Without sounding pedantic, you know, like, what does this have to do?

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
Like, so, oh, we just set everybody up.

117
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,460
Oh, I don't want to really hear this, you know?

118
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,640
He's gone over this so many times before in piecemeal and something.

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,240
We've done it back in O and G, sort of in piecemeal.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,500
What I want to do is first just put out something that is currently affecting anyone and everyone,

121
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,880
and this is commonly done.

122
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,420
When it comes to, let's just say, power utilities, utility bills, you know, electric, gas, water,

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,820
whatever, most people are complaining that the bills are going up.

124
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,040
Like, here in Tucson, they just came out and said, okay, from now on, your bill's going

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
to be 30% more.

126
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,360
All right.

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,640
Why?

128
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,900
Why are they doing that?

129
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,880
Because the cost of the production of the utility, all the cost doesn't call for such

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,320
an increase.

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,320
So, what are they doing?

132
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,540
Why is this happening?

133
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,160
You know, like, with the COVID, it's like all the municipalities, all the state governments,

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,580
all the federal governments in lockstep did it all together, right?

135
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,420
No opposition, like, you know, exposed that everyone, right, is in step with each other.

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,660
There's no opposition, right?

137
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,380
Okay.

138
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,040
Why are all the utility companies doing it?

139
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,660
Because they were lobbied for a while now to pledge the next 10 or 20 years of all their

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,040
billings into a private derivatives funds and hedge funds, right?

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,200
They're called CTOs, right?

142
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,740
And it's managed by them.

143
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,320
And they sell derivatives and shares in that and for a return.

144
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,060
So, using financial algorithms, you know, every year, you should get more, a small percentage.

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,220
So, they want to cover everything.

146
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,340
So the utility company comes back and says, your utilities are going up.

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,840
It has nothing to do with the production of utilities.

148
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,080
Now, what the hell is the Greek talking about?

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Yes, what they're doing is selling the future billings, 5, 10, 20 years.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Usually, it doesn't go more than 10 years, but up to 20 years for a big stable city.

151
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,760
Like, if you pick a city that's not going to experience a lot of growth, you know, like

152
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,880
it's already built up, they can do 20 years, right?

153
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,480
Okay.

154
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,060
Because you have a pretty good idea.

155
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,240
It's not like you go to a small town or a growing city, right?

156
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,140
Like, let's say Las Vegas 20 years ago, you couldn't really estimate what it's going

157
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,660
to be like in 20 years because you could just keep expanding and expanding and expanding,

158
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:47,980
right?

159
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,380
Phoenix and places like that, right?

160
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, yes.

161
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,980
Because you could continuously build on pieces of land.

162
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,280
However, if you go to, like, say Manhattan, you got an island there, it's pretty much

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Yeah, you could sell 50 years ahead because there ain't nobody building anything.

164
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,200
You know what I mean?

165
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,300
Yeah, they might build a tower and add another 500, but out of the million, 500 is not a

166
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,940
big jump, right?

167
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,300
Right.

168
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,340
Where something like Las Vegas can go from 1 million to 2 million people in 5 years,

169
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,580
right?

170
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,060
Right.

171
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
It's a double, yeah, yeah.

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,480
Right.

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,180
So this is I'm giving a little detail on this.

174
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,060
This is important because you can do something about this, right?

175
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,100
But it has to be organized.

176
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,060
So what they do is they say this is what we're going to be billing here for the next 5, 10,

177
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,640
20 years.

178
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,980
And this is the money we have coming in.

179
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,380
We want to put it in a fund, a derivative fund.

180
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,500
And you guys have people invest in it to get interest and play around, see what happens,

181
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,680
right?

182
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,539
Kind of like, you know, someone gives you money to go to Las Vegas, right?

183
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:39,980
Okay.

184
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,400
So it's a futures market, kind of like what they do with commodities, right?

185
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,640
Okay.

186
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,140
Yeah.

187
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,900
And they're called CTOs.

188
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,440
Birth certificates are also CTOs.

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,280
And, you know, like it's really hard to find out what's going on with the birth certificate,

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,540
right?

191
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,860
Why?

192
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,920
Because it's a CTO.

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
All right, what is a CTO?

194
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,080
It's a confidential treatment order.

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,520
In other words, it's a deal that's done in secret, right?

196
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,460
And they didn't really have a name for it until the SEC a while back decided to classify

197
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,680
a series of investments under CTOs.

198
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,760
And they're totally illegal.

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,740
Well, first of all, the whole system is unlawful.

200
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,360
But these are really illegal.

201
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,060
But they still keep doing it, right?

202
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,660
So, I mean, just like, you know, anything else.

203
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,600
So what you do, really, if the bills go up, you get enough people organized on the Internet

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,240
because you can also organize physically, you know, in meetings and places, pubs, whatever.

205
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,640
I don't recommend you do that.

206
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,380
But you can do it on the Internet.

207
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,200
Even then you'll be surveyed.

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,040
And you just find out which, when they're flipping these securities, you know, whether

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,480
they're flipping them on an 80, I mean, a 90 or 180 day cycle or even a 30 day cycle.

210
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,580
And right when they're ready to flip it, you have a majority of people in that city not

211
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,100
pay the bill.

212
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,840
So the earnings go to zero and then they're ready to flip it.

213
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,620
They're like, oh, shit.

214
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,380
You know, flip it means you're going to sell it to someone else.

215
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,360
You're like, oh, I don't want to buy that.

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,320
Nobody's paying the bills.

217
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,140
And then then when they can't sell it, they go bankrupt.

218
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:09,860
Right.

219
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,760
Because why do they go bankrupt?

220
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,660
Because they have nothing in the till, but they have to pay out to the dividends that

221
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,180
they promised.

222
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,560
So all you got to do is not pay your bill for one month.

223
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,100
Everybody.

224
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,860
But see, if one person does it, they usually defer it because you go a couple of months

225
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,540
and not pay the bill.

226
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,860
They just keep adding it up.

227
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,260
Right.

228
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,460
And then everybody has to do it in mass.

229
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,940
So the so the grand total goes down way low.

230
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Well, what percentage would be like the tipping point on that?

231
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,440
Because, I mean, look, you're never going to get 100 percent.

232
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
Twenty percent.

233
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,500
Twenty percent is all you would need.

234
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:39,900
OK.

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,320
Yeah.

236
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,620
Yeah.

237
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,980
Because you think they're they're only giving when they promise points on these things on

238
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,380
a 30 or 90 day basis.

239
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,040
It's just like one points, two points.

240
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,360
So if you drop it 20 percent, that one or two percent that they're promising gets really

241
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,860
small.

242
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,900
They can't fast.

243
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,340
OK.

244
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,740
I know.

245
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,140
I guess.

246
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,560
Yeah.

247
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,020
All right.

248
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,460
All right.

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:56,780
No, no.

250
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,120
So they're promising half and it drops 20 percent.

251
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,220
You still got a lot of, you know, a big, big deal.

252
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,460
Right.

253
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:02,880
OK.

254
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,120
So coming.

255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,400
So.

256
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:04,980
Yeah.

257
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,520
So go three months.

258
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
But everyone has to do it.

259
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,500
Right.

260
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,880
It's not.

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,280
It's not.

262
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,020
It's not a matter.

263
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,160
See, right away, the rational mind goes, hey, if I don't pay the bill, they're going to

264
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,940
shut off my utilities.

265
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,340
Right.

266
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,160
No, no, no.

267
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,880
They don't.

268
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,720
They usually defer it for a while.

269
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,900
But the point is, it has nothing to do with shutting utilities off.

270
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,180
The whole thing is to bankrupt that particular derivative, the financial house that's doing

271
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,340
it.

272
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,400
So it's usually a bunch of scumbags, retired attorneys or attorneys or whatever.

273
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,560
Yes.

274
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,040
Attorney equals scumbag, by the way, equal sign.

275
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,620
But anyway.

276
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,080
Right.

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,360
So.

278
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,540
So you go down the whole thing and you figure out a way to organize as many people as possible.

279
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,260
You pull the switch.

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,000
Watch what happens.

281
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Right.

282
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,180
But you've got to do it in mass.

283
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,460
So it's it'd be harder to do in a really big city, but a medium city, even even Tucson might

284
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,080
be too big.

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,880
Right.

286
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,280
Because there's almost a million people here now, three quarter of a million on average.

287
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,220
A city that's a quarter of a million, if you can organize 50,000, 60,000 people, you could

288
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,140
really start taking control of the, quote unquote, billing.

289
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
And by the way, all that stuff is bullshit anyway.

290
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,320
It's all public utilities.

291
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,420
They're already paid for by another CTO, which is known as the bonds people in prison, babies

292
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,020
being born.

293
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,700
Wow.

294
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,940
What is he talking about?

295
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,260
Right.

296
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,740
Well, I was asked to talk about this a little more because I brought up some terms like this

297
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,660
and the person was like, do a sonic on it, because I don't know.

298
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
I haven't heard you talk about that.

299
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,200
Right.

300
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:31,860
So.

301
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,940
So maybe the easiest way to do it is to go back, let's say, using the U.S. because everything's

302
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,000
kind of pinned to the U.S.

303
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,760
The bankers are using the U.S. as the policemen of the world, the military, which, by the

304
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,980
way, the military here sucks or it's a pretty crappy military, military everywhere does.

305
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,520
But it's pretty shitty in the U.S.

306
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,760
It's one of the worst militaries, believe it or not.

307
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,060
But it's because they're so mechanized equipment, you know, they've got more bullets than anyone

308
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,320
else.

309
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
They've got more tanks than anyone else.

310
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,020
Right.

311
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,100
They have more planes than anyone else.

312
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,960
They're so powerful.

313
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,820
But the actual training and the staff, you know, the ethics and morality is very low.

314
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,900
It's like one of the worst in the world rated.

315
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,240
Right.

316
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,600
What people say, well, it goes against the prop what we've been practically propagandized

317
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,060
to believe.

318
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,180
Just ask anybody who knows anyone that's in the military or someone that, you know, that's

319
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,980
rational that came out of the military.

320
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,940
What they have to say about it.

321
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,340
Right.

322
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,580
It's a shithole.

323
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,460
So because they're very heavily mechanized, it's a mechanized right.

324
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,160
A hundred years ago, they knew warfare would be mechanized.

325
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,360
Right.

326
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,860
It's not going to be like everybody stands in a row and someone says fire and then they

327
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,640
fire those mechanized warfare.

328
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,420
It started World War One.

329
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,740
Right.

330
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,580
So you have the military is also part of this.

331
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,140
All of this is attached.

332
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,180
I think I just derailed my thought here.

333
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,760
But going back to the history of the finance is really the U.S. because everything's pinned

334
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,380
to the U.S.

335
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,180
You know, a lot of currencies pinned to the dollar.

336
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,780
You hear that.

337
00:13:59,840 --> 00:13:59,980
Right.

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,640
What does that mean?

339
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,260
Right.

340
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
They talk about the petro dollar like you're only supposed to buy.

341
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,200
Well, that's that's fake.

342
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,440
The petro dollar is just that's like saying Muslim terrorists.

343
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,280
It's fake.

344
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,700
It's not.

345
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,640
There is no petro dollar.

346
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,120
It doesn't work.

347
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,580
That's it.

348
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,300
It's a distraction.

349
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,660
It's a distraction or a petro dollar is like saying, oh, yeah, the World Trade Center was

350
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,360
an inside job.

351
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,480
They use space weapons.

352
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,240
You know, they'll put that out themselves because they don't want you digging in the

353
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,620
direction.

354
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:23,960
Right.

355
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,020
That you might find some real stuff.

356
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,260
Right.

357
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,280
So.

358
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,020
Yeah.

359
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,280
No, there's no petro dollar.

360
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,140
That's that's no.

361
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,420
No.

362
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah.

363
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,180
The petro dollar is this.

364
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,520
If you say a petro dollar and you got to say the grain wheat dollar, then you got to say

365
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,180
your derivatives trading dollar.

366
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,500
Everything is great.

367
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,260
Well, the idea there that they that they push is that you can only make oil purchases with

368
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,980
U.S. dollars.

369
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,720
But to me, it's silly because it is silly because you can only make 90 percent of the

370
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,460
purchases that they do international with the dollar anyway.

371
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,400
So it's kind of redundant to say petro dollar.

372
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,460
Well, and the other thing is that with the computers, the way it is, it doesn't matter

373
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,180
what the name of the currency is.

374
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,100
Well, it works.

375
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,280
You know what it means that it's going to go through Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.

376
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,040
And right.

377
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,860
That's all it means.

378
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,260
It's got to go through those banks first.

379
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,980
They get a cut.

380
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,300
Yeah.

381
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,840
It's Rico.

382
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,620
It's Rico's.

383
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,120
What it is.

384
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,320
You know, Rico is racketeering influence, corrupt organization.

385
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,000
Right.

386
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,120
And that just means Rico's real simple.

387
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,380
Anybody can use it all.

388
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,420
You know, if you don't like what someone's doing, just send them.

389
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm going to do a Rico charge against you.

390
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,080
And they flip out.

391
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,340
Why?

392
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,260
Because Rico's really simple.

393
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,980
It's like if you want to do business with me, you have to do business with him first.

394
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,080
That's Rico.

395
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,700
OK.

396
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,660
Very simple.

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,320
Right.

398
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,620
I mean, most banks do Rico.

399
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,400
The most municipal, most governments do Rico telling you you have to have an attorney is

400
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Rico is a Rico action, right, telling you you have to have insurance to drive is a Rico

401
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,120
action.

402
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,980
I mean, anything is applicable to this.

403
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,540
That's what's great.

404
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
If you know how to use it, you can really use it to your advantage.

405
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,460
Demanding a Social Security number is Rico action.

406
00:15:59,720 --> 00:15:59,900
Right.

407
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,160
Because you're I'm coming to you to work at the place and you're asking me to get a number

408
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,660
from someone, another place to work with this place.

409
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,820
That's Rico, dude.

410
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,640
Yeah.

411
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,240
That's why any place you go that requires a Social Security number, it's give it to me

412
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,780
in writing and they never will because they have evidence of a Rico lawsuit.

413
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,120
Right.

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,180
And Rico's always trouble damages.

415
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,520
Right.

416
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,700
Means three times.

417
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,900
So like in the octave trouble, you know, just the trouble.

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,180
That's the third octave and up.

419
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,500
All right.

420
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,540
So let's just do the basic history and without even getting, you know, you know, people that

421
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,400
have listened to various sundry discussions of money that I've done basically define it

422
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,420
as portable land.

423
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,340
Right.

424
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,460
Because if you look at things that are precious, they come from the land.

425
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,780
You know, gold, silver, all the basic monetary materials or were extracted from the land.

426
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,080
Right.

427
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,420
Yeah.

428
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,860
So it's portable land.

429
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,140
And it doesn't have to be that it could be other things that haven't been discovered,

430
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,940
like the osmium, platinum, where they come from the land.

431
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,160
Right.

432
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,860
So, OK.

433
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,120
Really, really simple.

434
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,720
When when the people were accumulating precious metals and jewels and out of convenience or

435
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,920
out of security, they went to a place called a bank and they gave them the valuables.

436
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:18,339
And then the bank either took interest or gave interest for holding it, whatever.

437
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,200
They found out that when people went and gave deposited things into the bank, only one out

438
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,580
of 10 would come and frequently do a transaction to withdraw some.

439
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,720
So they said, hmm.

440
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,740
So basically everything that we're basically hoarding here in our vaults, only 10 percent

441
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,940
is called on.

442
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:56,040
So they developed this 10 to 1 ratio, which was basically we can lend out nine times more

443
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,180
than we have because if people come and call it, call us on it, they won't.

444
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,660
We're only going to only want to write only 10 percent.

445
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
So we're never going to say we don't have it.

446
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,600
Right.

447
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:05,960
So.

448
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,600
So they did a 10 to 1.

449
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,860
It's called fractional banking.

450
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,220
So if the bank had.

451
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,680
Yeah.

452
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,160
OK.

453
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,620
So if the bank had a million dollars in its vaults, they said they had nine million.

454
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,080
Right.

455
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,580
Because only 10 percent of the people come and take the money in and out.

456
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,020
So it fluctuates a little still.

457
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,660
Right.

458
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,900
So it's still unlawful to do this.

459
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,200
But the people allowed it.

460
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,960
By the way, it also coincided with the coincidence that most of the bankers were Jewish.

461
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,420
And in the Torah, there is a 10 percent, the tie that keeps coming up.

462
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,160
You know, you get 10 percent to the temple.

463
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,580
Right.

464
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,200
And and that.

465
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,520
Right.

466
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,920
So.

467
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:51,600
But and by the way, the Jews religiously and collectively and communities in countries

468
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,320
were usually chosen or rose into the position of becoming the local and almost national

469
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,140
bankers as well.

470
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,480
Why?

471
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,480
Two reasons.

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,520
One is because it's in their culture to be educated.

473
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Right.

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,260
Second of all, they didn't really have racial admonishments.

475
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,460
So when you had a country, let's say, like Italy, which wasn't a country is a bunch of

476
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,320
states back then.

477
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,800
Right.

478
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,520
City states.

479
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,100
You had a lot of feuding.

480
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,020
So when people moved around and you went through this part of what's known as modern Italy,

481
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,580
you couldn't do any banking because they found out what your name was like, oh, we're not

482
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,300
going to give you any money, right.

483
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,700
Or deal with your money.

484
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,220
You're no good.

485
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,540
Right.

486
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,780
So there was a lot of this either.

487
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,880
It was based on either your family name, where you were from.

488
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,100
You know, there were very there's a lot of animosity between the Jews didn't care.

489
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,640
They were like, doesn't matter who you are, whatever.

490
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,080
And it, you know, whatever.

491
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,240
And even that the national banks or the people that were the national bankers, meaning the

492
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,140
people of the same ethnicity, didn't like lending money to people who were poor.

493
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,880
Right.

494
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,440
Right.

495
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,640
But the Jews did.

496
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:10,020
And and that allowed people who were poor to actually if they had a sound opportunity that

497
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,440
if they got a loan, let's say they can use it and get out of that poverty.

498
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,240
But the Jews weren't stupid on this.

499
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,120
They said figure.

500
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,560
They figured, well, this guy's poor.

501
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,820
He has a sound opportunity, but because no one else is going to lend it to him, we're

502
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,520
going to lend it to him at a much higher interest rate, kind of like these no credit, bad credit

503
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,100
doesn't matter.

504
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,540
A car.

505
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:30,840
Right.

506
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,440
And it's 32 percent interest.

507
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,700
Right.

508
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,940
Drive it off the lot.

509
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,080
No money down.

510
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,640
Right.

511
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,320
Right.

512
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,280
But at least you get a car.

513
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,660
So now you get a better job, let's say, and you pay it back.

514
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,660
And then everybody's happy.

515
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Right.

516
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,520
Right.

517
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,700
Right.

518
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,240
But if they lose, if they lose on you, they got so many of these out, they're going to

519
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,940
get so much return anyway that it's it's it's almost covered.

520
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,200
Right.

521
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,940
It's like hedged.

522
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,560
Right.

523
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,320
So if you've got if you've got 32 percent, it's really simple.

524
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,120
You get three people out of four to cover it.

525
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,040
You can lose every fourth one and you're fine because that one is covered by the other three.

526
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,380
Oh, yeah.

527
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,860
Quite a bit.

528
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,240
Yeah.

529
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,800
Especially with compound interest.

530
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah.

531
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,320
Yeah.

532
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,640
So so I just want to give a little bit of that because, you know, the Jewish banker,

533
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,820
you know, is a big deal.

534
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,480
I just wanted to throw that out there because it's never really discussed.

535
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Right.

536
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,900
So what they did was the Jewish banker ethic helped a lot of people get out of poverty

537
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,080
because of the higher interest rates, because they were at the point where and I'll talk

538
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,360
about what the unions are, they went after the unions, very similar to Jews, but would

539
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
crash the the power of the unions very similar.

540
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,700
The people that were really desperate and wanted to stay out of desperation actually

541
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,720
paid the interest and were quite thankful and happy because that opportunity would have

542
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,100
been gone if they didn't get that loan.

543
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,460
So anyway.

544
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Well, they wouldn't have the ability to capitalize on anything because they'd never assemble

545
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,200
the money.

546
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,640
So here's the thing.

547
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,640
They're just grateful, even though it's a harsh, you know, again, it's it's got they

548
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,640
got out of poverty, which was a chronic condition for them.

549
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,020
It could have.

550
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,980
In other words, if they didn't if they didn't pay the 32 interest points and didn't get

551
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,140
the loan, that means maybe another two generations before an opportunity.

552
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,500
Right.

553
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,740
Well, a lot of people, they could never even build their credit.

554
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,740
They go and they get one of these crappy credit cards and they sit there and, you know, charge

555
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,380
this is different.

556
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,120
This is different.

557
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,760
Don't the credit card is completely different.

558
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,520
That's the exemption.

559
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,340
I'll get into that.

560
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,800
OK, but it's the same principle is all I'm saying is that they turn similar, but it's

561
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,060
really.

562
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,160
But hold on.

563
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,560
Once you find out how the credit card works, it's no, it's not the same principle.

564
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,000
It's complete.

565
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
It's similar in principle.

566
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,600
Similar.

567
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,360
Not the same.

568
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,600
OK.

569
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,120
Sorry.

570
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,600
Yeah.

571
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
It's because the conditions have changed so much.

572
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,340
Right.

573
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,240
It's conditions.

574
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,560
It's kind of like saying a sinking ship or a sinking airplane.

575
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,120
Two different things.

576
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,160
One is, can you swim?

577
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,800
The other one is, can you survive a fall of 30,000 feet?

578
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,520
Right.

579
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,280
Big difference.

580
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,000
They're both you know, you're both traveling.

581
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,240
Right.

582
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,520
OK.

583
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,300
And then you have to swim afterwards if you survive the fall.

584
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:51,680
Survive.

585
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,120
Yeah.

586
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,460
Chances.

587
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:52,720
Yeah.

588
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,080
So that's what I'm saying.

589
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,080
So they're they're similar.

590
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,500
You're in a vessel traveling.

591
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,860
Right.

592
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,800
Both vessels.

593
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,080
Right.

594
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,720
Yeah.

595
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,420
But very different because the conditions have changed so much.

596
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,700
OK.

597
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,080
So.

598
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,600
Got you.

599
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,780
This banking thing, fractional 10 to 1.

600
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,280
All right.

601
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
So basically the bank has a million in the vaults.

602
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,880
They lend out nine million and because they know only one out of 10 people are going to

603
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,560
come and withdraw.

604
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,060
Right.

605
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,840
So they could still.

606
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,100
Right.

607
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,400
OK.

608
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,840
So you get into what fractionalization is.

609
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,760
I just need to bring that up.

610
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,420
It's a main point here to show you really what's going on and how crazy finances or finance

611
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,960
either one.

612
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
And it's all scumbaggery.

613
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,700
It's all unlawful and illegal.

614
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,600
But because the people want it.

615
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:32,860
Right.

616
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,920
You see, just like earlier, I mentioned, if you do a big strike and everyone doesn't pay

617
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
their bill, what are they going to turn everyone's water off?

618
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,040
Good.

619
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,520
Let's see you try to do that.

620
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,820
Right.

621
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,840
That'll lead to the next thing.

622
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,460
You know, you have a small thing that leads to another thing, leads to another that, you

623
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,140
know, they're going to.

624
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,500
OK.

625
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,380
All right.

626
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,040
So you have this fractional banking system goes on.

627
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,660
So then you have all the machinations from the 19th century about privatizing the central

628
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,680
bank or the bank.

629
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,700
Instead of the national bank making it a private bank, they don't call it private.

630
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,900
They call it central bank.

631
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,720
When you hear the word central, it means private.

632
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,240
Right.

633
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,720
Just like the word nice means dumb.

634
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,460
Right.

635
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,660
It doesn't matter how you think what you think it means.

636
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,840
It's what it usually is, how it's being really used.

637
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,040
So they wanted the national bank to go private, turn it into a central bank.

638
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
And you hear of all the machinations back and forth.

639
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,500
And finally, you know, they did the Titanic, which was not sunk by an iceberg, which is

640
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,260
funny because I keep explaining to people a ship can hit a thousand icebergs and maybe

641
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,100
it'll scratch a little bit of the paint, maybe, maybe, you know, like you could take a two

642
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,280
foot by two foot block of an iceberg and I could hit you over the head with a chuck and

643
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,060
you'll laugh because it's like lighter than snow, lighter than styrofoam.

644
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,920
You could see there was a fail video I saw recently, two people trying to grapple up

645
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,500
on a big iceberg and they flipped the thing upside down.

646
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,720
That's how lightweight it is.

647
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,160
The iceberg was like 500 feet long and there's two people on one end and they flipped the

648
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,600
whole thing.

649
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,340
It's like one of the light.

650
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,940
It's almost on the category of aerogel.

651
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,500
If you don't know what that is, look up aerogel, A-E-R-O-G-E-L.

652
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,700
So the lightest substances in the world, it's the lightest natural substance.

653
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,880
Well, I like the idea of styrofoam because that's real relatable.

654
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,180
People can, you know, it's lighter than styrofoam, way lighter than styrofoam.

655
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,760
You know, I could pick up a big old thing of styrofoam that's probably, you know, half

656
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
the size of my house, not a problem, and just toss it if I wanted to.

657
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,440
Sure.

658
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,340
The size is irrelevant.

659
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,320
It's actually even lighter than that.

660
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,520
Yeah.

661
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,340
So that's a joke.

662
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,180
It's kind of like, you know, the 19 Arabs with hijackers, with box cutters vaporized

663
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,940
the World Trade Center.

664
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,440
It's the same.

665
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,360
All right.

666
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,540
So what that did, it got rid of opposition, but anyway.

667
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,140
So from one thing led to another, you know how governments pass stupid laws.

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,180
They passed the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Act basically for all practical

669
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:59,720
purposes for the people was that now a private company is handling the money system.

670
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,520
So this is how it went.

671
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,840
The U.S. monetary system was substance backed gold.

672
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,360
So basically the Federal Reserve said, I'm really oversimplifying it here, but it's still

673
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,660
true.

674
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,920
Federal Reserve said, OK, you give us your gold and we'll print notes for it.

675
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Gold and silver.

676
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,640
And we'll print notes.

677
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,040
And the cost for us to do it is six percent.

678
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:24,820
All right.

679
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,420
So they kept giving them all the gold, giving them all the gold.

680
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,280
There's lots of newspaper articles you can see between 1914 all the way to the 1920s

681
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,200
on how they just shipped out 70 million dollars worth of gold to France.

682
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,520
Oh, another 50 million dollars worth.

683
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,380
This is back then.

684
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,860
Right.

685
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,080
So that's like saying a billion now actually could be more accurate, 500 million now, maybe

686
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,980
more, more like 900 million.

687
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:54,360
So you see these, they had to take control of the newspapers because the newspapers were

688
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
printing every so often.

689
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,300
Federal Reserve just shipped another 60 million of gold to France, another 60 million to Germany.

690
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
And so people are like, wait a second, why am I reading that they're shipping all this

691
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,700
gold out?

692
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,300
Right.

693
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,920
So the Federal Reserve is like, we don't want to have that kind of rap.

694
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,840
You know, people hate us.

695
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,580
So let's just buy the newspapers to get them as they stop printing that stuff.

696
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,820
Right.

697
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,120
Right.

698
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:16,740
OK.

699
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,660
What happened was the gold being limited in stock by the late 1920s, they had the U.S.

700
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,520
had given all of the Treasury had given all of the gold to the Federal Reserve.

701
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,800
Right.

702
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,660
So they wanted to print more money and there's all you need more gold like we gave you all

703
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,020
the gold.

704
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,420
And they're like, by the way, you gave us all the gold for money, but you still owe us

705
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,160
six percent.

706
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,320
Yeah, of course.

707
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,140
So but we gave you everything we have.

708
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,520
Yeah.

709
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,780
But you still owe us six percent of the past 20 years.

710
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,520
All right.

711
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,300
And here's the problem.

712
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,260
If you try and get back all the paper that they printed and say, OK, now I want my gold

713
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,520
back.

714
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,140
It's not worth anything.

715
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,820
It's well.

716
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,440
Yeah.

717
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:57,780
Yeah.

718
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,480
So you couldn't do that anyway, because then you say the society is start.

719
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,480
Then you go into Star Trek.

720
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,220
Yeah.

721
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,400
Right.

722
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,640
There's no money in Star Trek.

723
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:03,880
Right.

724
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

725
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,620
You could do that.

726
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,020
That's fine.

727
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,920
That's how you get rid of them.

728
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,860
OK.

729
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
So what happened?

730
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,240
Well, here's the thing, because the U.S. was turned into a corporation in 1871.

731
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,880
Between 1871 and 1889, it was various stages of corporatizing it.

732
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,380
It was handled like a corporation.

733
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,600
It went into bankruptcy March the 9th, 1933.

734
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,240
There's a document on that doesn't use the word bankruptcy.

735
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,500
But if you understand what they're saying, it's pretty much what it is.

736
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,120
I went into receivership.

737
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,580
Now, the difference when you have a bankruptcy, usually there's a trustee of the creditor,

738
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,040
the person you owe the money to, send someone over to liquidate, and so they can get paid

739
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,160
back what is owed.

740
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,440
Or the other option is to put the business into what's called receivership, meaning it's

741
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,700
like it's not good to liquidate it because the community needs that business.

742
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,920
So we leave it be.

743
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,080
We put new management and we take over.

744
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,760
That's basically what happened to the whole U.S.

745
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,400
That's why whenever there's an election, there is no change in, quote unquote, monetary policy.

746
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,380
Same thing continues.

747
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,640
So it's all the only reason you have elections is it's a formality.

748
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,640
It's just like the 4th of July or Halloween or New Year's.

749
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
There's no effect at all, right?

750
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,200
This is this should be known.

751
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,860
This is right.

752
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,200
OK.

753
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,360
So and they're trying to tell you by when they when election is stolen, right?

754
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,060
It's like they've tried to make it more in your face how obvious it was because it's

755
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,400
like, come on, people, you know, anyway.

756
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,220
So what happened then was, well, what are we going to print money on?

757
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
Well, we need something of value.

758
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,020
So FDR made a couple of speeches.

759
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,400
They called him fireside chats back in the 30s on the radio.

760
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,040
Very important for people to look those up and listen to him, because if you translate

761
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,440
what he's saying, he basically says, well, we're in a banking situation, financial situation,

762
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,520
but we're a strong country.

763
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,960
We need everybody to pitch in.

764
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
Everybody has to volunteer what they have.

765
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,460
Get it?

766
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,000
Just like the speech that Wendell was a house made.

767
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,160
H.O.

768
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,540
U.S.C. is the guy's name.

769
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,480
Anyway, Mendel House, he said that soon everyone will be registering their biological property.

770
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,080
Right.

771
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,660
OK.

772
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:23,080
So what they had is basically new agreements in a CTO kind of form, confidential, but you

773
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,900
can find them, by the way, that all mortgages, the Federal Reserve notes that will be printed

774
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,600
will represent a lien, a presumptive lien on all property in the U.S., including people,

775
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,100
basically.

776
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,620
So birth certificates were already they knew they were going to go into this, just like

777
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,640
a lot of the stuff that you see that was put in place after 9-11 was not immediately put.

778
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,780
If you look at the history of it, it was started way before, like Homeland Security, most people

779
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,260
think, came into fruition in 2002 or late 2001.

780
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,100
That was already set up in the 90s, right?

781
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,540
And all that.

782
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,660
So that was under Continuity of Government because, yeah, what's weird is they came out

783
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,720
with the public cabinet post and all that for Homeland Security after September 11th.

784
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,060
But they didn't call it Homeland Security back then, but it's the same, it's the same

785
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,420
charter.

786
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,740
No, it was again, it was part of the Continuity of Government program.

787
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,020
That's really what it was.

788
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,560
The COG.

789
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:20,800
Yeah.

790
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,820
And it was actually written by someone who was in the 90s, who was actually behind all

791
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,520
of the, what were the terrorist acts in Italy?

792
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,100
The P2 Lodge.

793
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, yeah.

794
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,720
The P2 Lodge.

795
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,200
Yeah.

796
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,760
It was written by a P2 Lodge member.

797
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,580
And after they made it, they arrested the guy who wrote it and threw him away.

798
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,200
Yeah.

799
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,280
Giorgio Hugo Ballestieri.

800
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah.

801
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,780
The ones that didn't magically hang themselves under bridges.

802
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,180
Yeah.

803
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,600
Yeah.

804
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:47,820
Yeah.

805
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,040
Yeah.

806
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,140
Yeah.

807
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,500
That's funny.

808
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,340
And it's a little long, but you know, anyway, it goes on and on and on.

809
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,760
This is, this is the same stuff you, this is treachery that you read about.

810
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,400
If you study ancient Rome, the same treachery, if you studied ancient Babylon, same treachery,

811
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,140
if you study the Mayans, the same treachery, if you study the ancient Greeks or the Chinese,

812
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,760
you know, when a new Chinese emperor comes in, what does he do?

813
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,500
Not usually, but if he wants to be a strong armor, what does he do?

814
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,400
He goes and burns all the records and all the history, right?

815
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,880
That's typical for them, right?

816
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,880
So, okay, so now we're in that situation where, remember the 10 to 1, if they have a million

817
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,620
in the bank, they could lend out 9 million, 10 to 1, right?

818
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,760
Fractional reserve banking.

819
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,700
Anything above that is considered excessive, but go ahead, right?

820
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,240
If you look in the social security 1935 in the act, now someone says they found it.

821
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,220
Other people years ago said they can't find it.

822
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,800
And it's just true because they're changing things online, what you can access and what's

823
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,580
there and what's not.

824
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,800
And sometimes you might find it.

825
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,760
Sometimes you may not.

826
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,040
Right?

827
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,500
So one of the things that's mentioned in the social security act, 1935, because there's

828
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,140
several of them.

829
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,920
There was one in 1932 also that didn't call it social security, but anyway, you'll see

830
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,860
there that the births that are done in each state get a price of 6 million bucks, right?

831
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,760
This is back in the thirties, which in today's money would be a hundred million roughly with

832
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,440
inflation, right?

833
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:08,900
Maybe more.

834
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,720
Okay.

835
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,980
So what does that mean?

836
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,900
Now let's go back.

837
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,780
All these machinations with, you know, the U S going bankrupt and this and that, and the

838
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,540
birth certificates, you know, being secretly traded or used as an asset, all the land is

839
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,120
used as an asset for printing money and all that, that was done without the people's

840
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,040
consent and without any notice.

841
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,620
In other words, there are plenty of documentation to show that all this is in place.

842
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,380
Start at March the 9th, 1933, even Google brags about it.

843
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,000
They give you the document right there.

844
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,520
It's short.

845
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,180
It's just two paragraphs, three paragraphs.

846
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,300
They do mention, uh, you know, basically the same verbiage that you see in title 12, four,

847
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,660
11 U S code title, 12, four, 11, each country, every country in the world has a, something

848
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,280
like that.

849
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,060
It's called a rigid restrictor or conditional endorsement.

850
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,540
Right?

851
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,160
What does he tell?

852
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
What the hell is a Greek talking about?

853
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:56,760
Okay.

854
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,860
Let's go back.

855
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:04,340
So the, did the government give you prior notice and get your consent to go through

856
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,620
all these machinations with these private scumbags?

857
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,800
Answer is no.

858
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,139
No.

859
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,159
So because you weren't, you have to get some kind of a waiver, right?

860
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,480
Some kind of a waiver, right?

861
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,860
And what that was was what everyone calls their social security number.

862
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,780
What it was really called back then.

863
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,620
Sometimes when I tell people to read the old access, it doesn't say social security number,

864
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,020
I know, but you'll see the word exemption.

865
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,400
That's what it is.

866
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,040
So you get an exemption number.

867
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,400
Why?

868
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,340
Because if the shit got started getting worse and worse and worse, everyone signs up and

869
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,880
gets an exemption number, quote unquote, social security number.

870
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,760
So what you do is when you want to get some milk or some bread or pay a bill or whatever,

871
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,239
you use that number and it's good.

872
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,520
Why?

873
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,940
It's good.

874
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
It's a form of credit, like a credit card.

875
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,280
Why is it good?

876
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,739
Well, because the government got into a deal that screwed everything up and it really messed

877
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,520
up your life.

878
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,420
Cause now, you know, you live in a society, it's not Star Trek that you need some kind

879
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,360
of means of exchange.

880
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,660
So we'll use this number and that's what the credit card basically is doing.

881
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,280
Okay.

882
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,520
Right.

883
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,700
Okay.

884
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,020
Um, so essentially that's where you are with the money.

885
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,020
It's very, very simple, but you remember the gold 10 to one, when someone made a deposit

886
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,740
for let's say a hundred dollars, the bank counted it as 900 on their own private books that

887
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,440
they could write.

888
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,120
And in other words, if someone brings in a hundred dollars, they say they have $900 as

889
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,140
in, in right.

890
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,380
Actually 800 because you can come and pull that hundred, right?

891
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,720
So anyway, that's going on right now.

892
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,540
So when you sign a credit card statement, right, it doesn't say anything about, it says

893
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,440
you agree to, if you read the little verbiage, every time you sign it on the electronic thing

894
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,300
now, right.

895
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,020
It says you agree to perform according to the original agreement, it's always agreements

896
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,680
and contracts.

897
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,680
Well, your prior agreement.

898
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,040
Okay.

899
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,900
Well, let's say it's a hundred dollar thing.

900
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,640
It's Sears, right?

901
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,880
Or which no longer exists.

902
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,520
I think, or whatever, Ace Hardware moment you sign that, that credit card company sends

903
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,900
all the information to the banker that's carrying that credit card.

904
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,540
So in many, many of these credit card bank, you never even heard of the usually insurance

905
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,220
companies, not always, but anyway, you know, there's the American express and all the ones

906
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,680
you heard of.

907
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:12,840
Right.

908
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,920
So anyway, when you sign that purchase for a hundred dollars, you just created 900, right?

909
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,360
They give a hundred to the merchant.

910
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,480
The bank now is 800.

911
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,940
I mean, that sounds, it's like, that's why for how long they've been saying, Oh, use

912
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,860
your credit card or debit card and you get what?

913
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,320
Cash back up to 5%.

914
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,680
Yeah.

915
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,720
They give you one, two, five percent.

916
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:32,820
Oh my gosh.

917
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,780
You're doing 800% and you're giving me 5% pittance.

918
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,480
That's why when you buy something on a credit card and you have a hard time with the merchant,

919
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,600
call the credit card company.

920
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
Well, and it's not a real 5% anyway.

921
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,940
They give you 5%.

922
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,480
Oh yeah.

923
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,100
It's irrelevant.

924
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,640
Even if they gave you a hundred percent, you're still being shorted.

925
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,040
Yeah.

926
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,540
You'd be shorted because-

927
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,440
You're still being shorted.

928
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,540
Yeah.

929
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,660
So let's say it was a hundred dollars and they gave you a hundred percent cash back.

930
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,500
That means that they give you a hundred.

931
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,180
They've still got, as you said, they created-

932
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,620
600 now.

933
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,800
They've got 600 now.

934
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,460
Yeah.

935
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,680
So, so the bills at the end of the month go somewhere else.

936
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,560
They're usually attorneys.

937
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,220
They go by zip code, but, okay, so this is what's going on.

938
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,080
So the thing is you start using this system and you're destroying the economy because

939
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,940
every time they create more money, the value, the value on paper, paper on paper, on a ledger

940
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,320
says, we've got so much of that.

941
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,760
That's why you start hearing about Congress got together and just gave $400 million to

942
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,220
Nigeria and also they gave a billion dollars to Ukraine and they're giving 800 million

943
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,940
a year to Israel.

944
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,180
Why?

945
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,980
Because they have this surplus.

946
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,400
They have to get rid of surplus.

947
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,940
You know, surplus is a bad thing in finance, by the way.

948
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,600
Well, it's actually a bad thing.

949
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,020
If you were running a 7-Eleven, a surplus would be a bad thing.

950
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,780
Hey, Chuck, I got 10,000 hot dog buns.

951
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,640
Well, how long are hot dog buns good for?

952
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:49,940
Yeah.

953
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,760
You're not supposed to.

954
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,660
You gotta, you gotta keep.

955
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,200
That's really bad.

956
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,160
That's really bad.

957
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,600
Look, and here's, here's the thing.

958
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,280
Just, I need to slow you down just for a second because everybody else in the world has basically

959
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:07,460
been given to understand that if you're doing banking, uh, you can only write a check for

960
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,620
the amount that you have in your account, right?

961
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,080
So you

962
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,000
hold on a second.

963
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,120
Do you remember, do you recall loosely my whole check scenario?

964
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,420
What happens when you write a check?

965
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,700
Yes, I do.

966
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,440
Okay, good.

967
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,120
I hope others do as well because we might want to cover that again.

968
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,420
Yeah.

969
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
No, I think we're going to have to because here's the thing.

970
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,940
Everybody else would be listening to this if they didn't hear that would be saying, well,

971
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,600
here's the thing.

972
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
And it never makes sense.

973
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,340
They say, oh no, we're just adding to the debt and we have this massive debt and we're

974
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,420
worried about this debt.

975
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,400
Now it's strange that they keep calling it a debt.

976
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,380
It's not.

977
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,660
Let's stop right there.

978
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,760
When was the last time you've ever heard a politician in any parlance in any condition

979
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,380
in any place talk about the national debt?

980
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,020
Never.

981
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,700
Ever.

982
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,080
Ever.

983
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,520
Ever.

984
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,480
They never talk about it.

985
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:51,840
No, no.

986
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,460
But they are talking about the debt and the deficit now in Congress actually.

987
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,600
And the reason for this.

988
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,080
Well, no, not to the public though.

989
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,980
Not to the public.

990
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,620
Well, yeah, they have been recently.

991
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,020
They only really.

992
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,320
Okay.

993
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,140
So it's a new dish.

994
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,720
All right.

995
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,120
So they'll distract him again with this for a little bit, but never.

996
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,900
In other words, you'll never see it.

997
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,360
But here's what makes no real sense is that, okay, I can keep writing checks on an account

998
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,780
that, you know, they basically say is in debt.

999
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,460
You try that with your own bank account, right?

1000
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,680
You know, the little one you have there with your little name on it, you go to whatever,

1001
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,960
your credit union and so on and so forth.

1002
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,420
Okay.

1003
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,200
Hold on.

1004
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,980
Hold on before you get it.

1005
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,740
Let me give you something juicy.

1006
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,200
Sure.

1007
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,860
You know how, what happens if you write it, you have zero in the bank and you write a

1008
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,500
check at a chase hour of 50 bucks.

1009
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,720
Let's say you just wrote a bad check.

1010
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,260
The attorney general comes after you.

1011
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,220
This is no bad check.

1012
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,720
Writers will be prosecuted by the attorney general.

1013
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,040
Right.

1014
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,360
Okay.

1015
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,980
Well, it, if you look at title 1295 a 95 B it says there's nothing you can, anyone can

1016
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,220
write basically one of the citizens or people that could, they could be held against them.

1017
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,720
So you can get a napkin and write a hundred dollars on it and they could cash it and then

1018
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,640
they'll say, Oh, that's no good.

1019
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,680
But yes, it is.

1020
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,640
So you see the bar association now steps in and says, we can't let the people know about

1021
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,900
this because no one's going to go to work.

1022
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
They're going to say, Hey, fuck you.

1023
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,200
I got an exemption number.

1024
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,120
I get whatever I want.

1025
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,780
I'll leave the lights on door open.

1026
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,060
The heat are going in the water running all day long.

1027
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,320
Right.

1028
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,320
Cause here's my signature.

1029
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,100
And that's it.

1030
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,080
Now you have the money.

1031
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,860
They go away.

1032
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,800
Yep.

1033
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,520
They're like, because they're too savage.

1034
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,440
John, they see it.

1035
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,000
Would you say the start of the Federation in Star Trek, by the way, Federation and federal

1036
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,920
are completely different, by the way, but anyway, in the Federation, let's say the communities

1037
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,000
with under the Federation and Star Trek, would you call them savage?

1038
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,160
I doubt it.

1039
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,700
Maybe some of the planets that they go to are, but the Federation itself is highly organized.

1040
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,500
You don't see any, anybody, you don't see anyone wearing work boots with no shoelaces

1041
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,700
and their pants dropping down below their butt.

1042
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,020
Right.

1043
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,780
You know, I'm talking about the hip hop culture.

1044
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,540
You don't see that.

1045
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,320
Absolutely not.

1046
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,580
Here's the thing about that is that basically it's the replicator, right?

1047
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,800
Because here's the deal.

1048
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,300
You can get anything you need.

1049
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,680
That's all.

1050
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,700
Everything's in place.

1051
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:58,960
Yeah.

1052
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,260
You can get everything you need.

1053
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,860
It's there.

1054
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,560
There's no need for any exchange.

1055
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,220
You don't need to bother with it because of the replicator.

1056
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,780
And that's true.

1057
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,080
They have greenhouses too.

1058
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,420
But what I mean is we already have the replicator going in our bodies.

1059
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,680
All we have to do is mimic that.

1060
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Right.

1061
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,440
But we can't just like the medical community cannot let the people know that how the body

1062
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,380
really works because then you could replicate it and have anything you want whenever you

1063
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:21,820
want it.

1064
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,400
The same reason the financial community or finance and the Bar Association, the attorneys

1065
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,800
do not want the people to know that that what that is social security, that exemption number

1066
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,300
really can do and does.

1067
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,040
Right.

1068
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,680
Because now we will.

1069
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:35,900
Right.

1070
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,820
It'll just put them into irrelevance.

1071
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
That's the biggest problem right now.

1072
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,420
These techno companies like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Elon Musk and all that stuff poses

1073
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,440
a big problem to finance because people are ready to use those platforms, those digital

1074
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,340
cloud platforms to do finance.

1075
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:53,740
Right.

1076
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,640
And they do.

1077
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,300
But they're not the be all end all.

1078
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,840
The financial community, the bank, central bank does not want to give that up.

1079
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,580
And they're fighting with a digital currency of their own.

1080
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,260
You see, because once they give up power, it'll be like when the original power was

1081
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,180
given up around the time of the Renaissance from the kings and the monarchs to the financiers

1082
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,800
because the financiers were the merchants.

1083
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,460
They were dirty.

1084
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,920
They weren't even allowed in the palace.

1085
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
So but now it's the opposite.

1086
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,700
Now the financiers can put any king they want in.

1087
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:21,900
Right.

1088
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,940
So they don't the financiers know what they did and they don't want the tech giants to

1089
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,620
do it to them.

1090
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,600
So that's why you're having all these machinations going on.

1091
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,560
And that's when when they pulled the covid stuff, they said, look, you people think you

1092
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,960
control everything, but we're going to show you what we can do by sending everyone checks

1093
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,500
and flooding.

1094
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,240
Right.

1095
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,980
OK, so that's why I told people if you get a stimulus check for a thousand dollars, you're

1096
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,380
going to pay.

1097
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,940
That's going to cost you over ten thousand in the next five years because of inflation.

1098
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,300
Well, the second you sign that thing, you just created.

1099
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,420
That's right.

1100
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,580
Ten thousand anyway.

1101
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,260
Right.

1102
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,520
Yeah.

1103
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,220
When you sign it, you create ten thousand.

1104
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,540
Right.

1105
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
They give you a thousand.

1106
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,080
Right.

1107
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,000
Then they divide the rest into three.

1108
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,280
The bank gets one third.

1109
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,780
The central bank gets another third and the feds get another third.

1110
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,140
That's why the feds are swimming in money right now.

1111
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,100
Don't believe all that.

1112
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,280
The what they call the national debt is just the national ledger, because people are so

1113
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,780
irrational that if you are minus 30 trillion in a bank account, can you write a check for

1114
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,140
a dollar?

1115
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,100
No, no.

1116
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,260
And if someone gave you 30 trillion, can you write a check for a dollar?

1117
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,720
Still no, because now you're at zero and people say, oh, this government check is good.

1118
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,260
No, it's not.

1119
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,180
It's only good because they have the guns to enforce it.

1120
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:34,560
Right.

1121
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,640
So let's call it quits right here.

1122
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,980
I just had a cup of coffee and all that.

1123
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,740
I said, let's make it just one coffee long, because this kind of conversation has a lot

1124
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,640
of gravity to it and gravitas and it could drive people downward.

1125
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,000
So let's keep it upbeat and continue maybe on the next one.

1126
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, no, definitely.

1127
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,580
The mind blower to me, though, and the thing that I take away from this is, again, if people

1128
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,840
understood this, it would make so many things irrelevant, because if all you had to do

1129
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,440
was give your signature and therefore you had everything replicated for you.

1130
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,460
Yeah.

1131
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:12,080
But you can still, by the way, if you make a restricted endorsement, they are not supposed

1132
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,980
to fractionalize it.

1133
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,900
And we'll get into restrictive endorsements in the future.
