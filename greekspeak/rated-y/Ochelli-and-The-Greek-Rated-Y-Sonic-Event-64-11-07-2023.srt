1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,460
Rated Y episode, or not episode, haha, haven't said that in a while, there's a pattern break,

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,680
Sonic Event 64, thank you, and here we are, my mistake there, but I caught it, I was saying

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,420
episode a little while ago for something else, and that is episodic, this is not, so there

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,780
you have it, 64, kind of interesting, this is more than, I think, in total, not necessarily

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,220
in hours.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,520
Yeah, but Chuck, episode is not as bad as saying show, so it's alright.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,360
Okay, well, but it's not episodic in my mind.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:54,560
Well, yeah, 64, Hebrew gematria is emet, which means truth, is 64, yeah, well we were, yeah,

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,540
speaking of the truth, we were getting into finance, I think we might have overloaded

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,200
some people, underloaded others, frontloaded others, backloaded others, you know, and so,

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,540
yeah, I'm not sure about the reaction, because I've actually gotten less feedback regarding

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:14,140
the finance discussion, which was, in my mind, really loaded with a lot, than I usually get

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,400
from these Sonics, you know, a couple of days later, I usually have more feedback, and I,

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,480
we didn't get as much, yeah, well, I think just for the economy of time, that some of

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
the terms that I mentioned, I would just say, if you're more interested, just look up on

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,100
the browser of choice, fractional banking, but only take it to a certain degree, I would

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,300
avoid little cartoonish things that show how money is done, right, because that's all put

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,540
out by the same people, right?

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,980
Well, the Federal Reserve puts out some cartoons that do look informative, even on the fractional

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,760
reserve banking, I know you've seen them, right, the cartoons?

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,460
Yeah, it has nothing, yeah, it's false, none of that is like that at all, because everything

22
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,120
right now is done in secret, and there's two ways, one is to simply hide the secret,

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,180
the other way is to just never make people aware of it, so they don't know that there's

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,500
a secret, and they don't know what to ask for, and that's more in line with what I'm

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,979
doing here.

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,120
I've also had several contacts, emails, in the past, let's say year, about why don't you

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,320
talk about money a little bit, in terms of like, if you're earning, you know, working

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,340
in a company, or you know, doing books, or how would you handle that, right, so I might

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,560
want to get into that a little bit more.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,620
Before we get into that, go to YouTube and look up David Merrill, Federal Reserve, it's

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,120
called the Federal Reserve, is the name of the video, I think, I could maybe take a moment

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,660
and look for it, but he did something about eight years ago, or five years ago, or something

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,700
like that, very dry, very, whatever, on the Federal Reserve Act, and what your signature

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,060
really does, what it really means, and I could cover that, because that will help a little

35
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,380
bit.

36
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:08,060
David Merrill, he has a YouTube channel, Lawful Money Trust, I don't endorse these guys, but

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,880
because they're a little narrow, a little too narrow, but nothing, I haven't found anything

38
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,340
what they're putting out as incorrect, so it's viable, it's valid.

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,740
If you just, if you, let's say joined his group or whatever, and you did exactly what

40
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,840
he said, yeah, you'd be fine, it's just totally cool, but it doesn't have an open perspective,

41
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,740
that's all right.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,060
The other thing I would suggest is he, they have a forum, it's called a Suitors to Savings

43
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,520
Club, suitors, like a suitor, like the suitor in the Constitution, a suitor is someone who

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,160
can competently go into court, right, where, you know, a non-suitor has to be represented

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,460
by an attorney, so it's presumed that everyone is incompetent, right?

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,140
The first David Merrill I find, by the way, is David Merrill 101, is that him?

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,420
Depends on, his name is spelled a little bit differently, the title would be David Merrill

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:17,279
Federal Reserve Banking, would be the video, by David Merrill, yeah, yeah, so on YouTube,

49
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,560
I could actually, let's do that, because that's actually very important, and because the most

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,140
important part of that video actually is what you do when you sign unconditionally, you're

51
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,340
actually bonding it, so you're basically bonding means you're putting everything behind, right?

52
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,600
What they do, it's kind of like voting, voting has nothing to do with electing, it just says

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,220
that you are voting for the system, basically you have faith in the system, and this is

54
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,900
if you were an elector, who you would elect, right?

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,320
People don't understand that, let's see, let's just do a quick search, David Merrill, and

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,300
it's a double R, I, double L, I believe, unless they've, yeah, contact David Merrill on top,

57
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,920
oh my gosh, it's, I got that one, I'm sure that, yeah, I'm gonna push it to the bottom,

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,420
what reserve is to put in fractional, let's do, I'm glad I'm doing this, because it didn't

59
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:21,660
show up, yeah, see, that's why I was asking a follow-up question, because, yeah, fractional,

60
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,080
how does a fractional reserve banking work?

61
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,000
No, let's go to the channel, and I got one of those cartoons with the, oh yeah, they

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,640
like doing that, they sure like doing that, no, I don't think that's David Merrill, 101,

63
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,080
no, I don't think that's him.

64
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,980
That's not him, okay.

65
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,380
No, that's not him.

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Well, we'll have to, we'll have to come up with a way to find him then.

67
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Maybe they, maybe they killed it.

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,280
They might have taken it down.

69
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,360
Yeah, yeah, because he, yeah, because a lot of this stuff is, ah, this is for fractional

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,840
federal reserve, David Merrill, let's put lawful money next to it, yeah, oh boy, okay, well

71
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,500
we have some pretty savvy people, I brought up stuff, here we go, federal reserve, the

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:12,000
name of the YouTube, the title is Federal Reserve Act of 1913, hyphen, your remedy under

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
the common law, and this is what it should sound like, I'll just play it through the

74
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,700
microphone here.

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,640
Federal Reserve Act, written in 19, I'm David Merrill, and I'd like to speak for a moment

76
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,080
about the Federal Reserve Act, written in 1913, and the remedy found therein, and how

77
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,100
to apply it today.

78
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,100
That's it, 10 years ago, it's really noisy in the background, which, yeah, that's it,

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,760
if you can get that, it's very dry, ah, you know what, I'm going to copy that, and I'm

80
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,760
going to drop it in the chatango right now, just as a reference.

81
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,100
Yeah, let's put it there, I can go get it from there.

82
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,380
I'll put it in there right now, ah, you know, I'll drop it in the chatango.

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,820
If you like, I can get it from there, and we can play part of it as audio right on here

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,740
directly, if you like.

85
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,260
No, we could, I just wanted to bring that up, whether you got it or not, that's what

86
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,160
it should sound like, and that's fine.

87
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,040
No, no, it's, I don't know where to, I don't have any time markers, but let's get into

88
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,940
what's going on with it, with the system.

89
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,020
It's all based on your signature, remember, just on a quick recap, bankers found out that

90
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,440
only 10% of their people came back to pull their money out, right, everyone else left

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,920
it in, so they figured if they lent out 90% of what they had at the time,

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,920
they'd be okay, right, because, you know, if 10% of the people came in and took it,

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,800
they have nothing, but at least they're not busted, right, there's no bank run, they don't

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,760
look like they're, right, like they screwed up, right?

95
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,720
True enough, and if it floats up a little bit, maybe 20% comes in and takes it, you're still

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,160
doing good.

97
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,680
Yeah, but either way, that was the general, and also coincides with mostly people of Jewish

98
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,900
persuasion religion, and also the Torah, which is 10%, right, the tithing, so it kind of

99
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
worked out all right.

100
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,480
When the gold was all taken away, and the U.S. went bankrupt, every country has a bankruptcy

101
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,860
clause, if you can find it, and like for the Netherlands, it's different than for Brazil.

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,500
Most of the countries by the 50s were in the condition that the U.S. was in by 1933.

103
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,420
You know, like all the banana republics and all that, they probably came in as late as

104
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,220
the 60s.

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,700
So the whole world is under the World Economic Forum.

106
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,240
One way to know when the whole world went under this system is find out when the World Economic

107
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,140
Forum came into existence in the U.N., right?

108
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,080
Because that means they got all the 186 or 196 countries now.

109
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,440
All right, but that's not a real, that's the history, this is not a history lesson, I'm

110
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,060
not a historian, but I just want to bring this up because it's important.

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Why?

112
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,980
Because anything and everything can be accessed through some form of enumeration or currency

113
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,580
or money, right?

114
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,100
That's what makes people, that's what's really enslaved people.

115
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,640
You know how you're on a slave society, pick anyone and ask them if they could have anything,

116
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,460
what would they want?

117
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
And they always, it's always luxury.

118
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,460
Yeah, I want this car, I want that, blah, blah, blah.

119
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,180
A non-slave society would say, I want my needs met, you know, food, clothing, shelter, and

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,980
I want to be in harmony with everything around me, right, you see?

121
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,740
So, because of the slave nature, this money thing is very important, right?

122
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,940
So, and there's many aspects, so you know, I'll give you an example, I'll share something

123
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,440
personal.

124
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,860
Going through a health challenge, right, physical challenge right now, and it's very interesting

125
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,560
because I'm kind of doubting myself a little because I'm not getting, I'm not getting too

126
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,180
much improvement.

127
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm okay, but you know, kind of watching this condition, right?

128
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,280
So part of it's like, oh, the Greek talks all this smack about how you can take control

129
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,640
of your health, and he went to a doctor, right?

130
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,940
Or, I'm just telling you what's going on in my mind, or I don't make progress and it gets

131
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,460
worse and worse and gets sick and dies.

132
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh, the Greek was talking about health, he got sick and died, oh my gosh, so either way

133
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,000
it's no good, right?

134
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,180
So either way I have to succeed, right?

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,500
Yeah, I mean, on a long enough timeline, everybody knows.

136
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,140
Yeah, in other words, from a public perspective, right, if I keep sharing, right?

137
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me just recap, like, oh, the Greek had a health problem and he went to a doctor, ha

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,660
ha ha, or the Greek had a health problem and he killed him, ha ha ha, so the only thing

139
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,060
I can do to quote unquote save face once I start making this public, let's say, is to

140
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,880
fix it myself.

141
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,280
Successfully repair.

142
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
Because that's what I talk about, okay?

143
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,080
So the money stuff is just like that.

144
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,680
Everything is like that, right?

145
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,680
So once you start becoming independent, right?

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Less dependent, let's just say.

147
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,380
Okay, so, very easy.

148
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,140
The fractional system, now, what happened, the signature was replaced by the gold.

149
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
Now, let me just do a recap.

150
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,560
All the countries, everyone there, meaning on planet Earth, has a social security number

151
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,380
of some kind, most likely, right?

152
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,680
If you have a central government with a central bank.

153
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,780
Those used to be called exemptions.

154
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,200
You know, by the way, you can't use it for ID.

155
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,300
It's a really screwed up system.

156
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,080
Corporations need that from you, right?

157
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,440
Why?

158
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:27,100
Because did the people give consent and get full notification and disclosure about how

159
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,720
they were going to go bankrupt to this world finance cartel?

160
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,620
The answer is no.

161
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,980
And because they can't be held culpable, they were given an exemption.

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,300
They're exempt from all the machinations and maladies that might come from it by giving

163
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,740
them a number that goes to the treasury.

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,480
It's considered public funds, and you're supposed to use that when you need something,

165
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,740
if the money system is not around, right?

166
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,800
Okay, and that's being done all the time.

167
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,560
So, by the way, I knew someone who could finagle it.

168
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,300
No, I won't get into how to finagle it.

169
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,940
He went and bought anything he ever wanted with a social security number, and the attorneys

170
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,280
finally, through the bookkeeping, his name kept showing up.

171
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,800
Why is this guy getting all this stuff using his treasury routing number?

172
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,640
Because he needed the number, he needed a treasury routing number.

173
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,220
So they kept going after him, kept going after him.

174
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,920
He spent five years in jail because they basically said he was using public funds.

175
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,780
All right.

176
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,760
I also brought up the bar associations works with these guys, and the bar associations,

177
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,960
you can't tell people they could use that exemption or social security number and get

178
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,140
wherever they want, right?

179
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,180
Nothing will get done, and they're right from that perspective because it's a group

180
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,820
of society of savages.

181
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,940
Now, the other side is they run everything.

182
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,880
Give me an example.

183
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,440
Let's say you have the legal system, which has nothing to do with law, by the way.

184
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,360
You have the medical system, various social systems, political systems, right?

185
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,980
So you go to a doctor, which is part of the medical system, and you say, I want to use

186
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,100
this alternative therapy.

187
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,740
What did you say?

188
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,260
I legally can't say, right?

189
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:00,960
Oh, wait.

190
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,000
So now you're an attorney.

191
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,780
Now you're an attorney.

192
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,040
I thought I was in the medical system.

193
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,420
Now you're telling me about legal stuff?

194
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,540
Oh, okay.

195
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,820
So let's go to any social whatever.

196
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
Go talk to a politician or whatever.

197
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, you legally can't do that, right?

198
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,920
Oh, so now this is about attorneys.

199
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,180
Oh my, legal, right?

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,720
Legal, right?

201
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,240
So you go with finance to a bank.

202
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,560
Hey, I'm going to give you this signature.

203
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,560
Oh, legally, I can't do that.

204
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,020
Oh, wait.

205
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,940
So now you're not finance.

206
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,560
Now you're an attorney.

207
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,500
You see how the Bar Association runs everything by default, right?

208
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,440
By the way, did I get into this?

209
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,720
Do you know about the book?

210
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,200
There's various, it's called a book, a catalog, whatever.

211
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,160
There's a human trafficking going on, and there's photographers involved, the actual

212
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,380
kidnappers, the people that run the market, and the attorney generals of every state and

213
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,740
country.

214
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
How does that work?

215
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,860
Well, I've heard of this, but I've never heard you speak about it.

216
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,660
Yeah, I have in brief.

217
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
It's called a catalog.

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,120
What it is is these very wealthy people who like to predate on children look through a

219
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,140
book with children, and when they pick one, they bring them the child.

220
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,740
Usually, they tell them how available the child would be.

221
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,220
Now, what happens is the people who set up this market go to public places like parks

222
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,340
and beaches, whatever, and take photographs of children.

223
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,540
And the better looking ones, they just write down their license number.

224
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,960
They were with the parents, right?

225
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,220
We're talking like three years old to five years old, eight years old, right?

226
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,340
So when you're taking a picture of a child at the beach or a park or whatever when there's

227
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:39,360
gatherings, most likely there's an adult nearby, and most likely the adult got there via a

228
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
car, right?

229
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,740
So what you do is you find out, you hang around, and you find out what car they're going to

230
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,640
take a picture of the license plate.

231
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,160
So when that child gets picked, right, they have the license plate number.

232
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
So guess who they call?

233
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,400
The attorney general.

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,980
Here's the license number.

235
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,400
Give me all the info you got.

236
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,740
So what does he give them?

237
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,380
The address, where they go to school, all that stuff, right?

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,300
So now they know where to go make the pickup.

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Get it?

240
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,760
So that's a big part of their business, by the way.

241
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,380
Yeah, all of them.

242
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,620
By the way, if you don't do this as an attorney general or whatever, you will not be an attorney

243
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,460
general for long.

244
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,300
That's part of the, you know, right?

245
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,940
Now imagine you become an attorney general and you try to blow the whistle on this.

246
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,180
Ooh, in Spanish they say, pobre si, pobre si, poor you, poor you, right?

247
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,160
You're going to be deep fried monkey.

248
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,620
Okay, this is the world you live in, so stop being so naive.

249
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,940
Why are you calling me naive?

250
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm not naive, right?

251
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,040
All right.

252
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,240
So what's going on is they have these systems, they're called programs, that most of the

253
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,860
people that work in the banking industry do not know what's going on at all.

254
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Your signature is the most important thing to them.

255
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,480
Talk about litter, right?

256
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,320
If a banker's in whatever, he finds a piece of litter with a signature on it, he could

257
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,980
and, you know, some other information, which is an address.

258
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,760
Okay, so what's going on is very simple.

259
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,900
I think I brought up CTOs, which everything is a CTO now, the confidential treatment order,

260
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,720
which is illegal as hell, by the way, to do all these secret deals.

261
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,900
But anyway, it goes on and on and on.

262
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,540
So what's going on right now is how many signatures can we collect?

263
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,540
And also, after 9-11, they did what's called the Paperwork Reduction Act.

264
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,580
If you read that, it includes in there that, well, if you have a signature with a particular

265
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,700
phone number, we can also monetize the phone number now, right?

266
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,640
You get it?

267
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,680
Because this big phone number equals your signature, blah, blah, blah.

268
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,780
Part of the Paperwork Reduction Act was making it easier for them to monetize more than your

269
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,500
signature, right?

270
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,420
For example, one of the CTOs is – just a quick review.

271
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,240
Chuck, this is what's going on.

272
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,400
You write me a check.

273
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,240
Let's say we use regular slave talk, regular common whatever.

274
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
You have a bank account.

275
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,300
I have a bank account.

276
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,620
Sure.

277
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,040
And you have a checking account.

278
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,099
I have a checking account.

279
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,860
So you write me a check for $100 because you've got $1,000 in the bank, $5,000, whatever.

280
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,760
You can cover it, right?

281
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:30,960
All right.

282
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,820
Write me a check for $100.

283
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,320
Okay.

284
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Now, I go to the mail and I get it and I'm like, oh, Chuck, I need a check.

285
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,700
So I go to the bank teller.

286
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,040
I want to cash it, right?

287
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,800
I want to cash it.

288
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,780
I don't want to deposit it.

289
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
But the same thing happens on a deposit.

290
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,120
Okay.

291
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,740
I take the check out of the envelope.

292
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,280
I hand it to the bank teller and she gives it back and she says, I can't use that.

293
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
You can't cash that.

294
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,200
Why?

295
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Remember, I just took it out of the envelope and handed it to her.

296
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,020
She can't cash it.

297
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,220
Why?

298
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,300
Because she says, you have to what?

299
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,220
She needs you to sign it.

300
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,900
Endorse the back.

301
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,820
I have to endorse it.

302
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,600
You need two signatures.

303
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,440
That's why when you pull out a Federal Reserve note, you see a signature on the left signature

304
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,340
on the right or one on the top, one on the bottom.

305
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,840
You need two signatures to do this.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,120
Right.

307
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,780
That's what I'm telling you.

308
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,200
All right.

309
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:19,280
So the moment I endorse the back, she looks at her terminal and what the bank has in its

310
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,120
inventory is transaction numbers, just blank transaction number.

311
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,780
Just like, you know, when you buy, when you go to the movies and you, let's say right

312
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,000
now you want to do a thing where you sell tickets and the person who comes in, you tear

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,080
the ticket in half, give them a stub that has a number on it.

314
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,300
Right.

315
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,580
You know how you're going by.

316
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,400
You can actually buy a big roll of tickets.

317
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,800
Right.

318
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,120
Sure.

319
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,400
And they're all numbered.

320
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,740
Right.

321
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,840
That's what banks have in their inventory is a transaction reel or transaction roll or

322
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,920
transaction bulk.

323
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,200
I forgot what they call it.

324
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,540
So they got a bunch of these things digitally that are basically just like a ticket roll

325
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,340
at a movie theater.

326
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,240
Like a raffle ticket.

327
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,340
Right.

328
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,900
Like you might see a raffle ticket nowadays where they buy them already printed.

329
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,380
They have the numbers and they both say you tear them in the center and each of them has

330
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,320
a number on it.

331
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,360
So this way, if they take it out of the box, that's what banks have in their inventory.

332
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,700
So she turns to the terminal and here comes the next ticket number.

333
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,520
It's a transaction.

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,540
And by the way, what I'm telling you, any, any bank transaction you do when you get a

335
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,180
receipt, it does have a transaction number.

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,620
It's like 24 or 32 digits.

337
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,200
Look at it.

338
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,440
Yeah.

339
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,540
That's that number is their inventory.

340
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:21,980
OK.

341
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,280
So she pulls up a transaction number and it's blank next to it.

342
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,220
Everything's blank.

343
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,840
She types, she sees the two signatures and she types in a hundred dollars and she cashes

344
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,600
a hundred dollars away.

345
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,980
The hundred dollars come from the two signatures.

346
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:45,860
Now, what happens is the check that you sent me not only has your name, it has your account

347
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,520
number on there.

348
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,040
It also has the bank name and the bank information on it.

349
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,240
Right.

350
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,460
Well, when the check gets scanned, it has magnetic ink now, too, so it could read the

351
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,260
numbers like whatever.

352
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,560
It tells your bank right away that I did the deed.

353
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,360
You know, in other words, I did something with that check and created a hundred dollars.

354
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,620
Right.

355
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,560
Right.

356
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,580
My bank tells your bank that that happened.

357
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:07,860
Right.

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,100
Right.

359
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,600
Years ago, it used to take two or three days.

360
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,980
Remember, it takes two or three days to clear.

361
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,280
Yeah.

362
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,780
But nowadays, no, it's instantaneous.

363
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,840
And yeah, they would.

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Yeah.

365
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,440
Yeah.

366
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
They would have people.

367
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,380
They would have people.

368
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,720
They would use like Morse code, basically, to do it.

369
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
You know, a telex.

370
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,420
Well, you used to be able to say go to a grocery store, right?

371
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,380
You can run a check through.

372
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,840
And even if you didn't have money until Friday, you could go on Wednesday and run the check

373
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,480
through because, you know, they weren't going to get it to the bank until Friday anyway.

374
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,060
Yeah.

375
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,840
Stuff like that.

376
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,140
In other words, you wouldn't be in there.

377
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,840
Sometimes the check would be cashed and you still have a hundred dollars for a few days.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,520
Yeah, exactly.

379
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:36,780
Right.

380
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,600
Unless they got on the phone.

381
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:37,900
Right.

382
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,160
Right.

383
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,080
Right now, it's pretty instant.

384
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,520
So when that hundred dollars gets when that when that instant that transaction that I

385
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,920
did is your bank is notified, your bank, what it does is like, oh, the Greek cash check

386
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
or deposit or whatever.

387
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,800
We because Chuck O'Chelley went to kindergarten and his grandparents and his parents were

388
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,020
dumb.

389
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,560
I mean, but, you know, everybody's dumb.

391
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what I mean?

392
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,440
In that way.

393
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,680
Right.

394
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,520
About how the banking works.

395
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,940
What we're going to do is take the hundred dollars out of his account.

396
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,900
So when he looks at his account, he makes everything make sense.

397
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,120
Right.

398
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,580
Right.

399
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,180
But when the hundred dollars take it out of your account, it has nothing to do with sending

400
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,440
it to my bank to pay me anything because it's already done.

401
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,520
I got the hundred dollars from the two signatures.

402
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,400
Right.

403
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,200
So what are they doing?

404
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,200
The front of the check, which is for me and the signature on the back of the check, which

405
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,740
is you endorse.

406
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

407
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,140
They created the hundred dollars based on our two signatures.

408
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,260
They didn't need the hundred dollars from your bank account at all to do that.

409
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,340
But they take the hundred dollars out of your account because they make it seem like something,

410
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,820
you know, the money's worth something.

411
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,040
Right.

412
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,900
They can't leave it in there.

413
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,780
All you need is a hundred dollars for the rest of your life.

414
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,400
Keep using it.

415
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,020
Actually, that's what you do need.

416
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,460
But anyway.

417
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,920
Yeah.

418
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120
So what they do is they take it out and they put it in the CTO part of the legal parts called

419
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,620
the comptrollers, the legal part of the bank, legal department.

420
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,100
Right.

421
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,040
And your name is in there, too, by the way.

422
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,000
You are.

423
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,540
If you call the bank's legal department, they'll find you say, is there a choco Charlie?

424
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,320
Yeah.

425
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,400
He's in here, too.

426
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,540
Right.

427
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,140
Got another like personality in there now.

428
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,220
They know because it's in the legal department.

429
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,560
It's in this part where it's special transaction orders that you're probably never going to

430
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,160
access that.

431
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,560
You don't even know it exists.

432
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,280
So they feel pretty safe that they give you like 10 days, 30 days, maybe a little less

433
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,760
between 10 and 30 days.

434
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,880
And they know you're never going to go and call that hundred bucks.

435
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,780
You don't even know it's there because the regular retail side of the account shows the

436
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,920
hundred dollars is gone.

437
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,560
Right.

438
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,780
Right.

439
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,280
But it doesn't show where it went at all.

440
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,220
You presume that it went to me.

441
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,740
You're presuming.

442
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,140
Right.

443
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,940
So it sits in your own bank for and then what bank knows that you'll never going to find

444
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,660
out what they did.

445
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,940
So they want the money.

446
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,780
So what do they do?

447
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,480
The credits.

448
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,040
They file a 1099 on it, which is an IRS form, which is a stands for abandonment of funds.

449
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,840
Those are abandoned funds.

450
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,540
Right.

451
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,000
Right.

452
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,800
And it sits there.

453
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,080
Then they file a 1099 C, which is a claim form, and they take it.

454
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,680
But they don't just don't file a 1099 A on your thing.

455
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,540
They bulk all the transactions that happen during the day and the week.

456
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,440
And they file 1099 A on that could be millions, could be billions in some cases.

457
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,660
Then they claim it.

458
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,820
Well, how about this?

459
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,360
How about you put like a thousand dollars in the bank, run it all down during the month,

460
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,480
get the statement back.

461
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,640
And it shows you you start a thousand dollars when you did all the shopping, whatever you

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,060
did transactions.

463
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,080
And it goes to zero.

464
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,460
OK, you take that statement that they send you and you staple it to a 1099 C right away

465
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,440
that you want to claim this, just send it to your own bank.

466
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,520
Oh, oh, no.

467
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,420
Goes back to what the attorneys say.

468
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,700
Right.

469
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,280
Remember.

470
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:50,880
Right.

471
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,360
Right.

472
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
They're going to say, well, who do you think you are?

473
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,360
I never address the point.

474
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,380
By the way, if you run into a bank attorney about doing this, they will never address

475
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,980
what you're trying to do.

476
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,840
Who do you think you are?

477
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,040
Are you an attorney?

478
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,240
Where did you learn this?

479
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,400
But I never get always side skirting.

480
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,400
And they close the bank account, by the way, and they tell you there's no reason they don't

481
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,780
have to give you a reason closing the account because under consumer laws, they could deny

482
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,260
service.

483
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:15,840
Right.

484
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,460
Now, don't they do this when people die to the same thing where it's like, oh, yeah, they

485
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,040
do it all the time.

486
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,440
OK, because allegedly you have money in a bank account.

487
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:23,800
Right.

488
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,700
And so now on the sheet, it's different.

489
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,440
It's different.

490
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,520
It's the people.

491
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,660
Don't talk.

492
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,160
Forget about.

493
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,520
No, no.

494
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,540
This happens with all the old day transactions.

495
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,440
Now, this is important that it gets out to the public in mass.

496
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,600
Why?

497
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,460
Because there's so many people that get thrown out on the street or can't eat because they

498
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,960
did have a thousand dollars in their bank a month ago.

499
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,000
Right.

500
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,960
Now they go.

501
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,240
The cards is zero.

502
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,880
They swipe it.

503
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,480
Nothing happens.

504
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,260
You can't write checks.

505
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:47,540
Right.

506
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,900
They think they can write all the checks they want.

507
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,480
Actually, it's best to let the checkbook go to zero and close the account and then write

508
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,080
checks off of it.

509
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,920
That's another story.

510
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,300
Close the count is even more.

511
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,600
Then it goes directly to the Treasury.

512
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,240
It never goes to.

513
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,820
OK, so.

514
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,740
So all these people that are living hand to mouth, they spent the electric banking, whatever

515
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,240
checks, cards, whatever.

516
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,620
Right.

517
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,320
What do you think they would do if they find out that their own bank was using.

518
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,600
Right.

519
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,980
Think about it.

520
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,820
We would end the system right away, which it should be.

521
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,520
It should be.

522
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,280
But anyway.

523
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:20,740
Yeah.

524
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,120
But it's up to the people to do it.

525
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,580
By the way, the people like this and they don't care.

526
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,100
I brought this up to very, quote, unquote, commoners just above NPC.

527
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,880
They're like, I don't care.

528
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,720
I get what I want.

529
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,780
Well, I don't like it.

530
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,340
I'll tell you that.

531
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,220
I don't like it at all.

532
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,720
That's why.

533
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,780
That's why I'm talking.

534
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,820
You know, when I talk about all the death and destruction that's coming, there's no

535
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,280
way out.

536
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,200
That's the only way to change.

537
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,120
So, OK.

538
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,160
And it's not going to be done by humans, by the way.

539
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,500
You can't because the humans want this to continue.

540
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:56,480
So, by the way, another thing is when you sign these electronic, you go to a hardware

541
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,280
store, you return something, they want a signature or you write whatever, you sign these electronic

542
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,700
pads.

543
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,080
Right.

544
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,780
In their paperwork reduction act and all that, that signature has to be relayed.

545
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,040
Once it's collected by device, they call it, they call them devices.

546
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
It has to go through.

547
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,120
It's OK to go through several third parties and the third parties could also be part of

548
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,600
the bank.

549
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,100
It says.

550
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,480
Right.

551
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
Because, you know, it's electronic.

552
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,100
Right.

553
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,160
It has to go through a program.

554
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,540
The warranty of the device itself might usually the people who supply the device also supply

555
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,260
the program.

556
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,120
Right.

557
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,800
And they could have various partnerships and relationships, not just vendor.

558
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,780
So let's say you make these signature electronic signature boxes.

559
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,120
Right.

560
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,420
You also be smart to make your own program, too.

561
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,000
Right.

562
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,600
And you could be a vendor and sell those devices to the bank or you can go into what with the

563
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,340
bank partnership with the bank.

564
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,640
Right.

565
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,060
Or you could lease it to the bank.

566
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,080
Many arrangements you can have when you supply this equipment.

567
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,400
Right.

568
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,020
Right.

569
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,000
You supply the equipment or the data.

570
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,280
Turns out they all go into partnership and they bounce the signature around before.

571
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:03,700
Oops.

572
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:10,140
What happens is your signature might end up on a blank contract, like a credit card application

573
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,980
that you didn't even know existed.

574
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:12,980
Oops.

575
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,000
Would you remember a few years ago, Wells Fargo got busted because they opened up like

576
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,640
four million credit card app credit cards accounts without anyone.

577
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,220
Oops.

578
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
You see how this is being done.

579
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,400
I was talking about this and trying to avoid signing a check because electronically they're

580
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,940
using this.

581
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:38,880
And then a year after I was pushing this, Wells Fargo opened up like was the four hundred

582
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,420
thousand or four million credit card accounts without their people.

583
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,720
It's so stupid.

584
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,280
The system is so open.

585
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,420
They started even sending bills for transactions that never happened because it's all you know,

586
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,220
it's crazy.

587
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah.

588
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:49,940
Right.

589
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah.

590
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,700
You've heard of it.

591
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:51,840
Right.

592
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,360
The Wells Fargo.

593
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,340
That's that's exactly what happened is people got these notices that they had these open

594
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,220
credit cards with all the stuff on it and they went, I never applied for this credit

595
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,400
card.

596
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,880
What are you talking about?

597
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,360
Yeah, exactly.

598
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,140
Well, but this is being done over and over and over.

599
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,580
Unlimited.

600
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,680
OK.

601
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,160
So.

602
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,320
So what do we do?

603
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,040
Well, first thing you want to do if you don't like the system is don't approve it.

604
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,960
And the way you find out not to approve it is by doing a conditional endorsement.

605
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:26,000
So when you endorse to sign the name, make a clause before it lawful money only or lawful

606
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,020
money only per 12 USC, USC for 11.

607
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,420
Right.

608
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,760
12.

609
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,120
And what that does, it tells them that now you're operating on a lawful money side.

610
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,940
Now, what happened was you're able to get silver at the banks up until Bretton Woods,

611
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,180
up until the 70s.

612
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,400
Right.

613
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,400
But no one or you can get U.S. notes, but no one asked for it.

614
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,520
No one cares.

615
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:57,340
By the way, the lawful money, most states in their labor law statutes and codes, when

616
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,800
it talks about wages, it says and wages will be paid in lawful money and issued by check

617
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,400
in person, in cash, electronically, in lawful money.

618
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,400
Actually, the state codes actually say that state codes are telling you it does say in

619
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,000
lawful money.

620
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,300
Yeah.

621
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,060
If you look at.

622
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah.

623
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,000
All of them do in some place.

624
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,880
And all states and countries do have a restricted.

625
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,800
You can you can do a restrictive endorsement.

626
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,140
So when you pay so you can't pay taxes with funny money doesn't pay for anything.

627
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,600
So the reason why people say pay taxes while no one's really paying taxes, what you're

628
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,600
doing is you're filing a return to return a certain amount back.

629
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,400
It's private.

630
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,440
It's not public money.

631
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,060
Right.

632
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:43,900
Yeah.

633
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,980
And everything that you do is under the penalty of perjury signature.

634
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,100
So if you do something they don't like, there's prison for you because it's perjury has nothing

635
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,980
to do taxes.

636
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,320
Right.

637
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,680
No one is illegally in jail for not paying taxes or evasion.

638
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,400
It's usually if you look at the case, it doesn't say tax evasion.

639
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
There is no clause.

640
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,480
There is no crime like that.

641
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,000
It's usually false information to official government official.

642
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,400
Right.

643
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,240
Like Martha Stewart.

644
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,600
People.

645
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,100
You know what?

646
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,580
She was in there.

647
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,400
False information.

648
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,820
Look up the case.

649
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,020
It's the charge.

650
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,920
It's false information.

651
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,880
Not because she whatever they said.

652
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
Remember, everyone thinks, oh, she was betting on Wall Street.

653
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
No, she she did time because of false.

654
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Right.

655
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,180
Right.

656
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,680
Yeah.

657
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,380
They said it was insider trading or so.

658
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,860
No, no.

659
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,800
It's false information.

660
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,140
If you look at the case to a government official while she was being interviewed.

661
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah.

662
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,020
It's always.

663
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,760
OK.

664
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,040
Very interesting.

665
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,400
So very, very interesting.

666
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:47,960
A couple of more things that the way you're getting you get got is there's a presumption

667
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,600
by the legal.

668
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,380
Now, legal and banking cannot separate the two.

669
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,220
It's the same thing.

670
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,500
Right.

671
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:52,660
OK.

672
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,220
They're trying.

673
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,540
Right.

674
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,200
So people are trying to separate them, whereas it's all medical and legal is the same thing.

675
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Right.

676
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,480
All of it.

677
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:02,900
It's the same.

678
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,480
It's all controlled by the bar.

679
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,740
It's like a giant trust.

680
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,740
And they're the trustees.

681
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,680
But the thing is, attorneys are dumb as dumb as you know what?

682
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,220
Because you can't let them know what's going on because they're subject to it.

683
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,480
Also, the thing I wanted to bring up is that it's a presumption that everything you're

684
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,260
doing is that there's a lien on it.

685
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,200
Right.

686
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,400
Or when you say you've paid something and you're using these credit just without demand

687
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,620
for lawful money, there's still an attachment because you use their private money.

688
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:32,940
Right.

689
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,460
OK.

690
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,820
So that's where the clause comes in.

691
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:42,560
That's why even if you buy a house or whatever, you can't really own it because you use funny

692
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:42,900
money.

693
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,320
There's certain verbiage, you know, lawful money, some kind of you have to make to do

694
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:55,820
a separate transaction or notation that you completed and not just discharged, but settled

695
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,840
everything and satisfied everything with lawful money.

696
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,380
Right.

697
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,620
So the other thing is presuming that everything is in commerce.

698
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,820
So for example, property taxes that people pay or even stuff on the car or whatever,

699
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,620
but the property taxes are there of OK, let's just do it in the negative form.

700
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,480
OK, who doesn't have to pay property taxes?

701
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

702
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,620
Not if you know only nonprofits, nonprofits, 501 C three.

703
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,140
Nope.

704
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,420
Doesn't say 501 C three.

705
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,740
Well, a lot of just nonprofit.

706
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,120
OK.

707
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,760
Any nonprofit.

708
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,140
You don't pay property tax.

709
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,360
So let me ask you where you live in your house, where you eat, sleep, fuck shit, sleep and

710
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,060
all that stuff.

711
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,100
Are you doing any of that for profit?

712
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,080
Some people might be.

713
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,920
But well, no.

714
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,760
The answer is not.

715
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,000
So why the hell are you paying property taxes?

716
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,420
Because, you know, if you, quote unquote, have right now, they have a problem with that.

717
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,620
And there's another way to handle that, because they're afraid that, well, if they let too

718
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,200
many people go.

719
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,940
And by the way, the money that you pay in property is not one penny goes to do anything.

720
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,760
Right.

721
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,460
Not one penny.

722
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,460
It all goes away.

723
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,860
And you're just showing an account.

724
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,220
You can't.

725
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,920
How do you know?

726
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,680
If you're driving down the street, does it say, thanks for your taxes, paying for the

727
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:05,900
road?

728
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,600
And this is bonds, the bonds, everything you've bonded.

729
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:10,860
Right.

730
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,480
They're interested in what you're bonding and get into that video.

731
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,580
David Merrill, the 1913 Federal Reserve, you'll see what he talks about bonding.

732
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,200
I like it because he kind of flips it on people a little bit.

733
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,620
If you feel like you get smacked on the side of the head from him, good, because that's

734
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,600
what he's trying to do.

735
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,900
So everything is supposedly commercial, presumed commercial.

736
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,220
When you do these conditional endorsements, it's kind of like, you know, I'm tired of being

737
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,080
messed with and I know what's going on and you can't provide lawful money.

738
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
But I'm asking for it.

739
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,040
So, you know, don't mess with that.

740
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,980
Don't mess with me, please.

741
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,520
On the rest of it.

742
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:45,780
Right.

743
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,400
They really don't like that.

744
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,400
By the way, again, with the property taxes, they don't want people knowing this for several

745
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,720
reasons.

746
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,440
It's not just that they doesn't matter if no one paid taxes tomorrow, not everything

747
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,420
would be exactly the same.

748
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,000
These services and everything, maybe not because the bankers control the nukes.

749
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,739
If they find out that they have been found out, they'll drop the nukes.

750
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:11,659
The generals, by the way, you can look up all the generals in the military.

751
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,020
They all have degrees in finance.

752
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,620
There's a reason for that.

753
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,219
Yeah.

754
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,639
Look, come on.

755
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,880
Look up any general right now.

756
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,739
Pick up a general that, you know, look up his Wikipedia page where do you go to college

757
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,520
for and for what finance, because that's where they get you in finance school.

758
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,880
That's how they'd start taking control.

759
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,139
Right.

760
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,760
So anyway, pick any general.

761
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,520
I am.

762
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,820
You'll see.

763
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah.

764
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,639
It's fine.

765
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,179
It's looking right now.

766
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,699
Yeah.

767
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,080
OK.

768
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,080
So anyway, the reason why they don't want you to find out about the property taxes, because

769
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,940
if they admit that they're wrong for doing it now, they have to come up with what the

770
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,380
back taxes that you paid.

771
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,659
That's a lot.

772
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,400
That could be a lot.

773
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,719
Right.

774
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,660
So when you go after them for that, they just I don't want to do it from now on, you know,

775
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,400
and they always ignore you.

776
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,220
But what you do is you drop you drop and make it a federal case because the taxes are county,

777
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,380
local, state, whatever.

778
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,040
So you drop a federal case and you say, listen, guys, you're ignoring me.

779
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,800
But I see this.

780
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm sending you a copy of the federal case.

781
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,680
I'm going to be filing in three days.

782
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,500
Let me know what you think.

783
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,520
Oh, finally.

784
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,540
Oh, come and talk to us.

785
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,620
Hmm.

786
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,420
Right.

787
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,120
I was looking up General Petraeus.

788
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,760
He doesn't have a finance degree.

789
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,280
What does he have a degree in?

790
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,140
He has a let's see, a B.S. degree in military science, of course, military science.

791
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:35,340
He also has a degree in let's see where Petraeus is also one of the last of the old school

792
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,720
ones.

793
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,580
Yeah.

794
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,020
He's got military degrees.

795
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:38,960
Yeah.

796
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,440
He was one.

797
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,700
He came in on the tail end of the old school, you know, after him.

798
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,420
If you guys are well, just portrays in the 70s.

799
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,040
Got to be right.

800
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,720
Well, let's see.

801
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,380
Petraeus was born in 1952.

802
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,900
So he's 70.

803
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,440
He's barely 71.

804
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:54,980
Yeah.

805
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:55,800
OK.

806
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah.

807
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,420
I was just looking him up.

808
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:57,800
Yeah.

809
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,760
Look at the younger guys in there in their 50s.

810
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,240
Usually you're not going to make general unless you're in your 50s.

811
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,520
What about that General Milley that we see on the news all the time?

812
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,200
What do you think about him?

813
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,100
I don't know.

814
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,700
Never heard of him.

815
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,100
OK.

816
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,740
He was the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

817
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,020
Anyway, let's let's see what we get.

818
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,560
I was just curious about it, you know.

819
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,020
Yeah.

820
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,800
Check it out.

821
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,600
Well, let's just be more accurate then with the finance in indirect proportion of them

822
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,860
are in finance degrees.

823
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,360
OK.

824
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,080
So, yeah, once the bankers find out that, you know, and you want to change, they will

825
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,660
they control the military, by the way.

826
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,240
How do I know?

827
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,620
Well, how does the military get paid?

828
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,180
With what?

829
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,120
With the budget.

830
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,420
Right.

831
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:37,940
OK.

832
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,040
Where do they get that from?

833
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,880
Right.

834
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,860
Congress approved.

835
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,400
From what?

836
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,600
Federal Reserve.

837
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,040
Treasury puts in the order.

838
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,500
OK.

839
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,020
Police.

840
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,280
I think you guys I think you guys remember where police came about.

841
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,540
Right.

842
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,080
The banks.

843
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,320
The banks.

844
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,800
The banks took control of the city hall and the state governments.

845
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,340
And they're like, wait a second, we own everything in the state or half of half of everything

846
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,280
in this state.

847
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,360
But if there's a riot or something goes, you know, people get crazy.

848
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,180
That's our property.

849
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,200
You know, what I'm seeing is they get degrees no matter what their main degree is.

850
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,760
They always end up with these other degrees in international affairs, they call it.

851
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,800
Look, that's that new school that that, you know, everybody's going through the past 25

852
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,260
years.

853
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,700
Yeah.

854
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,140
Because I was looking up General Milley here, who, again, let's see, Mark Milley, born 1958.

855
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,280
Wow.

856
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,620
OK.

857
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,940
He's a little younger.

858
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,020
So he's yeah, he's in the 60s.

859
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,300
Yeah.

860
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,120
Well, I'm going for these younger guys that I just know are generals, you know, but OK.

861
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:38,800
Yeah.

862
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,120
Good.

863
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm sorry.

864
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:39,960
Anyway.

865
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,240
Yeah.

866
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,880
Look around.

867
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,100
Yeah.

868
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,480
You'll see.

869
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,380
And yeah.

870
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,600
So, yeah, that's pretty much it.

871
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,440
So the wonder of international affairs.

872
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,060
You can get in depth in any of these things.

873
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,620
Well, maybe let these two sonics fly.

874
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,680
Yeah.

875
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:51,780
Yeah.

876
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,280
And I'm wondering, is there a reason to get specific on anything other than things that

877
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
directly affect people?

878
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,040
It's important to know that every time you sign something, that's the gold.

879
00:37:59,420 --> 00:37:59,700
Oh, yeah.

880
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,320
No, absolutely.

881
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm wondering what a degree in international affairs actually is, you know, because I'm

882
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,760
wondering if that's not exactly what you're saying.

883
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,660
You know, international affairs really just boils down to finance, you know.

884
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,860
Well, yeah, that's what it is.

885
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,140
Yeah.

886
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,700
Basically, I wouldn't say that.

887
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:16,840
No.

888
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,180
I've seen research.

889
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,040
These guys in the military, upper colonels, generals, admirals, whatever, they all had

890
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,920
degrees in finance.

891
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,220
Right.

892
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,900
Well, here's the thing.

893
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,020
You know, I haven't done this kind of research in over a decade because I don't care anymore.

894
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,460
I got you.

895
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,240
But here's the interesting part of it is that all these guys with these degrees in international

896
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,940
affairs, they have tons of them.

897
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,980
Anytime they're a general that moved up in the government.

898
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Right.

899
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,780
It's vague.

900
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,600
It's vague.

901
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,480
But here's what it's like.

902
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,680
Liberal.

903
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,640
It's like liberal arts.

904
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,020
Yeah.

905
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,020
But here's what it's supposed to encompass.

906
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,720
All right.

907
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,980
It encompasses politics, economics, communications, art, religion and possibly literature.

908
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,440
So it looks to me like a liberal arts thing.

909
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,520
But look at what the second thing that's mentioned is economics.

910
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,620
So it's politics, economics, communication.

911
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,120
So I think that's the.

912
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,340
That's the World Economic Forum stuff.

913
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,700
Yeah.

914
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,980
You know how they're grooming.

915
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,440
Yeah.

916
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,020
What was the other school like the one that the Clintons went to and Rhodes Rhodes Scholar?

917
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,460
Yeah.

918
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,840
Right.

919
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,140
Right.

920
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,420
Yes.

921
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes.

922
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
They get you through all these.

923
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,920
That's the Cecil Rhodes.

924
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,860
Started that.

925
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,580
Yeah.

926
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,060
Yeah.

927
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,700
Rhodesia.

928
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,200
Right.

929
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,540
Yeah.

930
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,060
Rhodesia.

931
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,300
Yeah.

932
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,300
That's another thing after him.

933
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
But right.

934
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,540
Rhodes Scholar.

935
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Rhodesian Redback.

936
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,400
Redback or Ridgeback.

937
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,820
Beautiful dogs, by the way.

938
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,440
One of the most beautiful dogs ever.

939
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,240
Oh, yeah.

940
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,980
And Mel and Melanoise also, which are Belgian.

941
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,100
But yeah.

942
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,900
So Rhodes Scholarship, Rhodes Trust, University of Oxford, because remember, that's where they

943
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,320
sent them.

944
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,760
You know, that's right.

945
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,140
By the way, all the Ivy League.

946
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,440
Look up the history of all the Ivy.

947
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,280
This is a little tangent.

948
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:53,220
All the Ivy Leagues were either religious schools or families that did it did really

949
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,460
well in the opium trade and wanted to give back, quote unquote, right, and cover their

950
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,420
sins, you know, kind of like Nobel, you know, the Nobel Prize.

951
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,760
He wanted to cover his sins supposedly for coming up with high speed chemistry and by

952
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,980
giving awards, you know, explosions.

953
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,640
Yeah.

954
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:10,740
Yeah.

955
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,740
It's called high speed chemistry.

956
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,300
That's what it is.

957
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,600
It's measured in feet per second.

958
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,660
It's a chemical reaction.

959
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:14,900
Yeah.

960
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,160
But common parlance, explosives.

961
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,160
Right.

962
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:18,820
Yeah.

963
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,060
You don't have to use that word, though.

964
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,380
But yeah.

965
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,700
In other words, if you say high speed chemistry, those that know, know what you're talking

966
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:23,960
about.

967
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,540
Those that don't know, don't need to know.

968
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:25,980
OK.

969
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,760
Fair enough.

970
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,320
Yeah.

971
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,060
But I'm looking at the Rhodes Scholarship thing.

972
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,640
It's pretty interesting.

973
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,100
It was established in 1902.

974
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,620
And, you know, again, it's Cecil Rhodes doing this whole thing.

975
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,160
Yeah.

976
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,160
It's all one big club.

977
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,700
Because they know that if they control the money, they control.

978
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,400
Right.

979
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,000
Especially.

980
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,540
OK.

981
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,340
The more urban you are, the more, quote, unquote, society.

982
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,140
Let's put it this way.

983
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:47,680
OK.

984
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,400
Let's maybe finish off with this.

985
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,280
Was it Karl Marx?

986
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,180
He said that.

987
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm paraphrasing that money is one of mankind's most alienated inventions.

988
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,700
Think about that.

989
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:05,920
Well, yeah.

990
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,060
Because it's disconnected from the thing that it's supposed to represent.

991
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,340
You know, you invented it, but you.

992
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,540
But at the same time, you're trying to get it.

993
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,540
Well, how could.

994
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,160
What do you have to do?

995
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,800
Why are you trying to get it if you invented it?

996
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,520
Why not just print some more?

997
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,420
Here's an interesting thing.

998
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,520
It's not just based on printing out of thin air.

999
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,580
They do keep books and ledgers.

1000
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,080
OK.

1001
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,560
Well, OK.

1002
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,020
Another thing.

1003
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,860
The state does this because they're they're a banking institution.

1004
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,000
Basically, they're bankrupt.

1005
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,120
And you notice how they misprint everything.

1006
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,900
Like if you get a title to something, they it's all capsized.

1007
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,740
And they never finish the word or rarely do.

1008
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,400
Or is it right?

1009
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,700
Because later on, if they if there's a, quote, unquote, gathering of these people for being

1010
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,160
unlawful and some kind of judicial, they'll say, well, you could see it.

1011
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,740
So we didn't.

1012
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,000
You can't be the same thing because it's spelled differently, meaning all caps or right, right.

1013
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,980
But no real thing in the world in English language is spelled with all caps.

1014
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,180
You know, no real thing.

1015
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,960
Yeah, it's a fiction.

1016
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,320
Yeah.

1017
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,080
But it's also Ohio is the only state that has it in there.

1018
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,760
There's it's what it's called.

1019
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,640
It's a title.

1020
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,860
And it talks about fiction has to be in all caps.

1021
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,540
It's the only state, I think, that has it.

1022
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:19,720
Yeah.

1023
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,020
But that's but that's the reality.

1024
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,760
Office.

1025
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,220
Yeah.

1026
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:22,880
Has it also.

1027
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,740
And that's the reality, though, is if you see something in all caps, it automatically

1028
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,480
indicates it's not a real thing.

1029
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,800
It is a thing.

1030
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,940
But look, they're not doing anything to anyone.

1031
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,940
It's this is what everyone prefers.

1032
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,480
And the statistic, everyone, the majority.

1033
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,840
Right.

1034
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,420
So this is the type of society that you live in.

1035
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,780
It's it's unethical, immoral, however.

1036
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,220
And you wonder why.

1037
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:53,200
Well, because it's on that basis, basis of of the money system.

1038
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,320
And of course, anyone might take it.

1039
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,040
Let's just go to a Gaddafi in Libya.

1040
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,960
You know, he basically knew this and he used it for the people.

1041
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,860
Basically, they all got bills and they said, just sign them, send them back.

1042
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,720
Yeah.

1043
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,820
That was the big problem.

1044
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,780
And then he said, well, we'll just make our own money.

1045
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,340
And here it was.

1046
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,960
What I'll do is I'll lend you my money so you can build stuff and you don't need these

1047
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,500
other banks.

1048
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:11,760
Sure.

1049
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,720
He cut them out.

1050
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,740
That's that's why he had to go.

1051
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,000
You know, the little green book he wrote, you know, the green flag of Libya.

1052
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,440
Right.

1053
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,960
And they tried to, you know, say all kinds of oh, he's a cannibal and he's a killer.

1054
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,780
He's a terrorist.

1055
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,400
Yeah, of course.

1056
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,880
What really he did is he pissed off the bank.

1057
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:26,860
Yeah.

1058
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,780
And when they whenever they say something about someone else, it's what they're doing.

1059
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,760
Well, of course.

1060
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,320
But this is how the people want it.

1061
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,200
How do you know?

1062
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Just go out, go outside and take a poll.

1063
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,080
First of all, 90 percent of people have no idea of money.

1064
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,240
They think it's still based on something and at all.

1065
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,440
And 90 percent of that 90 percent doesn't care.

1066
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,120
Well, that's why that's why I object to you and everybody else talking about the fractional

1067
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,580
reserve where it's like, oh, by 10 percent, this and that, because they gave up on that.

1068
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,600
They don't even know.

1069
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,900
They don't even bother with the 10 percent.

1070
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,220
It's the system.

1071
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah.

1072
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,020
But the system doesn't bother with that anymore.

1073
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,480
It's not on 10 percent.

1074
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,420
That's the way it started.

1075
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,560
Now, it's whatever.

1076
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,120
No.

1077
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,160
Well, Paperwork Reduction Act, it could be nine hundred to one.

1078
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,240
It doesn't matter anymore.

1079
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,480
Right.

1080
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,580
That's what I'm saying is that.

1081
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:15,820
Yeah.

1082
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,560
I think it's silver.

1083
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,700
The silver is like nine.

1084
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,600
Eighty six to one.

1085
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,060
Yeah.

1086
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,980
So when you when someone does a commodity silver exchange for a one dollars of silver

1087
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:30,600
becomes one hundred eighty six for the silver market to leverage on the market of silver

1088
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,120
production.

1089
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:31,580
Right.

1090
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:32,720
Great.

1091
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,820
And they don't need the silver, by the way, for this electronic circuitry and all that.

1092
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,920
But it doesn't exist.

1093
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,040
I mean, that's the thing.

1094
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,220
It just doesn't exist.

1095
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,820
It's a measurement.

1096
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,580
It's a metric.

1097
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,640
It's a metric.

1098
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,380
But it's on something that isn't in hand.

1099
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,420
See, here we go again.

1100
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
Just like the money, whatever.

1101
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,260
They don't need the 10 percent like that.

1102
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,440
That used to be a rule.

1103
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,260
But no longer.

1104
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,780
Chuck, before we go, type in 12 U.S.C. 411 and read it.

1105
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,900
The first site that comes up should be Cornell Law and just read it.

1106
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,640
It's really short.

1107
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,020
OK.

1108
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,660
Twelve U.S.C. 411.

1109
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,180
Exactly.

1110
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,120
That verbiage used to be in the Federal Reserve Act.

1111
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,820
They took it off.

1112
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,620
Federal Reserve Act.

1113
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:20,200
If you have a book that has the Federal Reserve Act and Constitution, that's SCAN, it has

1114
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,940
the same verbiage.

1115
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,280
Yeah.

1116
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,480
Cornell dot edu.

1117
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:22,980
OK.

1118
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,880
Go ahead and read the verbiage.

1119
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,240
Has 12 U.S. code and then a symbol there, which I'm not entirely familiar with.

1120
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,120
Well, it's section, a section for the title 12, section 411.

1121
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,640
It's a little squiggly tilde line.

1122
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,220
It's like a weird like it looks like two S's on top of that section.

1123
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,500
Section 411.

1124
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:39,800
OK.

1125
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,480
Issuance to reserve banks.

1126
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,620
Nature of obligation.

1127
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,120
Redemption.

1128
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:43,720
Right.

1129
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,180
OK.

1130
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,560
Is the title of the section.

1131
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,920
That's the title of the section.

1132
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,040
It says Federal Reserve notes to be issued at the discretion of the board of governors

1133
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,180
of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to Federal Reserve banks

1134
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:05,660
through the Federal Reserve agents as here in after set forth and for no other purpose

1135
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,680
are authorized.

1136
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,580
Stop.

1137
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,140
All right.

1138
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,420
So.

1139
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,460
If you just reread that, which you probably don't have to, it gave you the purpose is

1140
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,960
supposed to go to the Federal Reserve agents right through the banks and no other purpose

1141
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,740
is authorized.

1142
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,320
Right.

1143
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,560
No other use is authorized.

1144
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,420
Do you need an attorney to explain that to you?

1145
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,560
No, it's it says for no other no other purpose.

1146
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,300
So that means this is the only purpose period.

1147
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,980
So but everyone's got Federal Reserve notes in their pocket.

1148
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,420
So that can't they're not authorized to use it.

1149
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,860
If you're not authorized to use something, you have possession of it.

1150
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,300
What is that object considered contraband, contraband, contraband, stolen, ill gotten

1151
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,600
this many different things, misdemeanor, misappropriated.

1152
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,300
It's a misdemeanor.

1153
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,100
Misdemeanor.

1154
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,300
Your demeanor is your attitude.

1155
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,540
So I continue reading.

1156
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,800
Oh, you want me to continue?

1157
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,180
I'm sorry.

1158
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,500
Yeah.

1159
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:58,720
Yeah.

1160
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,420
Let's see.

1161
00:46:59,500 --> 00:46:59,660
OK.

1162
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,060
Here.

1163
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,360
OK.

1164
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,400
The said notes shall be obligations of the United States.

1165
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,140
Stop.

1166
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:05,960
Yes.

1167
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,100
If you look at if you get a check, it has the bank on top and then it has your name

1168
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,140
printed right below it.

1169
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,380
Right.

1170
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,980
And then you issue the check.

1171
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,020
When you pull out a Federal Reserve note, it says Federal Reserve on top and then right

1172
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,500
below it says United States of America.

1173
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,240
It's a check.

1174
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:21,760
Yeah.

1175
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,480
The client.

1176
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,200
The client is the United States of America because they're bankrupt.

1177
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,340
So they gave him this checkbook.

1178
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,820
Go ahead.

1179
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:27,500
Right.

1180
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:27,840
OK.

1181
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,200
Let's see.

1182
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,560
Shelby.

1183
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:30,720
Whoa.

1184
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,240
Hold on.

1185
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,000
Let me back up a second.

1186
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,960
Start from the beginning.

1187
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:33,560
OK.

1188
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,640
The said notes shall be obligations of the United States and shall be receivable by all

1189
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:46,580
national and member banks and Federal Reserve banks and for all taxes, customs and other

1190
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,580
public dues.

1191
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,420
All right.

1192
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:48,780
Stop.

1193
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,920
Who's who can use them for customs, taxes and public dues?

1194
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,100
The Federal Reserve agents.

1195
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,380
Right.

1196
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,780
Yeah.

1197
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,600
The only ones that can use it.

1198
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:58,860
Yeah.

1199
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,400
Yeah.

1200
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,560
Yeah.

1201
00:47:59,560 --> 00:47:59,980
That's right.

1202
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,120
And I had an attorney get my face.

1203
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:02,660
Well, you can use it.

1204
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,840
I said, go see.

1205
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,620
See.

1206
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,380
First paragraph.

1207
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:06,760
Right.

1208
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:06,960
OK.

1209
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,560
Go ahead.

1210
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:07,780
Yeah.

1211
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,340
They shall be redeemed in lawful money.

1212
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,680
Now, wait a second.

1213
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,320
Let's back that up real quick.

1214
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,560
They shall be redeemed in lawful money.

1215
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,600
Now, let me stop on my own here.

1216
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,560
Keep going.

1217
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,060
Keep going.

1218
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,680
No, keep going.

1219
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,740
I'd prefer you keep going.

1220
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,100
All right.

1221
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,520
No problem.

1222
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,400
They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United

1223
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,760
States in the city of Washington, District of Columbia or at any Federal Reserve bank.

1224
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,800
Right.

1225
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,860
Now, stop right there.

1226
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,680
On demand, you have to make a demand.

1227
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,740
But it takes when you make a demand, it has to be fulfilled by another person.

1228
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:52,160
So if you're alone, right, and you're making demands and the only person in the room, well,

1229
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,860
this guy's crazy.

1230
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,820
But if you have two people in the room and you're making a demand, that demand goes towards

1231
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,480
the somehow influencing the actions of the other, isn't it?

1232
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,920
The other person has to be the one making the demands.

1233
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,960
So when you show a demand, when you're making endorsements or whatever lawful money on anything,

1234
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,540
you're demanding them.

1235
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,700
In other words, you are relieved of anything that might be attached.

1236
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,400
So if there is a tax liability or some liability after you've shown to make the demand, it's

1237
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,780
not your onus.

1238
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,640
It's on whoever you made the demand to, first of all.

1239
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,220
And second of all, I don't know how this is.

1240
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,080
This is kind of hard to say.

1241
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,960
How do I want to say this?

1242
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,880
Because this opens up a whole other sonic.

1243
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,360
It doesn't really make it lawful money because so few people were really demanding silver

1244
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,960
or for it that they don't do that anymore.

1245
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,260
But it relieves you.

1246
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,680
It should relieve you from all the liabilities that if you did a full endorsement now.

1247
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,360
Well, not now.

1248
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,040
Let me ask my question here, because this is the question I was going to stop at before.

1249
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,820
OK, they shall be redeemed in lawful money.

1250
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,000
I wanted to stop there because here's the problem.

1251
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,700
What you're telling me directly there is that I use these to redeem lawful money.

1252
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,060
So this in and of itself is not lawful money right there.

1253
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:14,860
No, no.

1254
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,300
That's right.

1255
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,220
That's why when I let's say I'm doing a transaction and you do cash, right, that's all I do.

1256
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,900
And I the woman looks, I said, you know, where they get the serial numbers on here and this

1257
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,140
and that.

1258
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,740
This is a check.

1259
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,700
Because, huh?

1260
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,760
I said, take this to the bank.

1261
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,440
You're supposed to take this to the bank and the bank's supposed to give you money for

1262
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,640
it.

1263
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,160
Yeah.

1264
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,820
Well, that's the thing.

1265
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,320
And they look at me like, wait, I thought you said it is money.

1266
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,200
What are you talking about?

1267
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,020
Well, that's the thing.

1268
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,500
You're redeeming this thing for lawful money.

1269
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,340
It says it right there.

1270
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,760
Yeah.

1271
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:50,280
So, OK, let's just this is a very hard thing to wrap up, but a very simple way to do is

1272
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,200
go back and listen to David Merrill, how he explains what the bonding process is about.

1273
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:59,160
Because remember, when you're in a public place and it says thanks for the bonds that

1274
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,820
paid for these roads and never says taxes.

1275
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,100
Right.

1276
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,760
It's the bonding.

1277
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,320
Right.

1278
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,920
The other thing I wanted to bring up with reading this section of the title, every country

1279
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,500
has something like that.

1280
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,220
We found one for Canada and it doesn't talk about lawful money.

1281
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,780
It just says that you can make a restricted endorsement.

1282
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,400
We found one for Australia.

1283
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,600
We found one for the EU.

1284
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,980
It just basically says that you should not be impeded on making.

1285
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:35,720
It says account holder, bearer or something of bonds cannot be restricted from making

1286
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,360
cannot be impeded on making a restriction.

1287
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,840
You know, they use they try to because if you if you have a new something like the EU, which

1288
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,700
is fairly recent, not really, but let's say and you make very clear language, people pick

1289
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,260
up on it.

1290
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,560
Right.

1291
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,520
Right.

1292
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,280
So they kind of make it obscure.

1293
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:01,000
But the whole purpose of this is there is no way out, but there is a better way while

1294
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,740
you're in it.

1295
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:03,780
Right.

1296
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,920
I got you.

1297
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,740
So there's a better way to handle it since it's here and you're here.

1298
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,520
Yeah.

1299
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,080
Ever since you've known me or whatever, I said, do you make a restrictive endorsement?

1300
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,600
Are you just signing these things?

1301
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,780
Right.

1302
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,760
You've heard me say, right.

1303
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,060
Yes, because it does work.

1304
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,980
Now, when you make the demand, it's actually you're actually you're influencing someone

1305
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,480
else to act on your behalf and you are relieving yourself of any liabilities or restrictions

1306
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,660
because you've made the demand, which also means you have to have record keeping good

1307
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,100
records.

1308
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:40,560
So whenever you handle cash, like, for example, when I get cash, a person saying, I say, I

1309
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,740
need all the notes, the serial numbers on the notes written down and did not denominations.

1310
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,020
And if you don't want to write them, you just photograph the bills or whatever, if it's

1311
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,660
a money order.

1312
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,240
Also, you do the same thing and you keep a record book of that, you know, and you send

1313
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,260
it at the end of the year, the Treasury say, look, I've got all these Federal Reserve notes.

1314
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,600
Here's the serial numbers, all these checks.

1315
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,340
I'm sending you the serial numbers and I need money for this.

1316
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,340
What are they going to tell you?

1317
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,000
Ha, ha, ha.

1318
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:10,160
We don't have any more money, but it relieves you from any other liabilities.

1319
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,520
And now this is very important because a very simple thing like someone saying, well, Greek,

1320
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,340
I'm going to 1099.

1321
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:17,960
That's fine.

1322
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,340
Just put the full amount on there.

1323
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,340
And at the total is zero.

1324
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:25,320
So when you do returns and they told you to itemize, you just itemize, go ahead.

1325
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,840
You did one hundred and twenty seven thousand four hundred sixty three dollars and thirty

1326
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,560
six cents on this.

1327
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,340
And don't even, you know, you want to show expenses, whatever.

1328
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,060
And then on the very bottom, the total you put zero and then you have an attachment because

1329
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,720
you redeemed everything for lawful money.

1330
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,560
But you have to be able to show that you did.

1331
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,740
Right.

1332
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,400
OK.

1333
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,160
And it's really hard to do with electronic transfers.

1334
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,900
You need something in between.

1335
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:55,100
Now, I think David Merrill on Lawful Money Trust, it's like eight hundred a year, a thousand

1336
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,360
dollars a year because he has a PayPal.

1337
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,720
I'm like, how the hell do you do a restriction with PayPal?

1338
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,200
Yeah.

1339
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,920
Without paperwork.

1340
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,660
Because he's doing a paper.

1341
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,020
So he must have figured something out.

1342
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,020
It might be worth for someone to join that and figure out how he did it and just tell

1343
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,780
everybody else.

1344
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,100
Yeah.

1345
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,500
Because I'd love to know how that works.

1346
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,340
Yeah.

1347
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:11,720
With PayPal.

1348
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,440
Because I tried to do the PayPal thing and the whatever.

1349
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,120
And if you put in lawfully, it has an A.I. that looks at the address, try to put it in

1350
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,900
the address box as an invalid address.

1351
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:27,120
I put the address in lawful money, only invalid address, invalid address, invalid entry, invalid

1352
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,460
entry.

1353
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,300
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

1354
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,400
How do you get around it?

1355
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,580
I don't get around it.

1356
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,700
You want to show that you're making you're not getting around anything.

1357
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,180
You're making a demand.

1358
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:34,480
Right.

1359
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,660
A lawful demand.

1360
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,180
Listen to that video.

1361
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,980
It was a 1913 Federal Reserve Act.

1362
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,240
Right.

1363
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:40,780
Yeah.

1364
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,840
David Merrill.

1365
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,280
It's got that annoying buzz.

1366
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,880
I think they put that on there deliberately because most people, you know, don't don't

1367
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,820
care about the content.

1368
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,880
They just, you know, care about the fluff.

1369
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,500
Right.

1370
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,600
Like if someone sounds like they have to clear their throat, they can't listen to it.

1371
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,200
But no matter what the information is.

1372
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,460
Right.

1373
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,320
Yeah.

1374
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,840
You know what I mean?

1375
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,040
It depends on the individual.

1376
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,760
So they made it hard to listen to this YouTube video.

1377
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,780
But the information in there is gold.

1378
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,060
And he does smack you around a little bit.

1379
