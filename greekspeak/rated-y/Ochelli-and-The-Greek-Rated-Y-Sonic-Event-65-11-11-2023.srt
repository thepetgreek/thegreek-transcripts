1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,620
Sonic Event 65, Ocelli and the Greek rated Y, and you know, I keep getting hit with lots

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,460
and lots of commercials.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,360
And oh, by the way, I've been going over some old footage of the Kennedy assassination because

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm going to be doing a conference soon and all that.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,300
But going over that stuff and taking a look at the new coverage, you might want to look

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,720
back at some of the Sonics where the Greek was talking about what it is they show you

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,180
versus what's actually happening.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
It's really fascinating when you look at the archival footage from 1963.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,800
But anyway, another day we'll talk about that because a lot of things going on.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,620
So you know, Greek, I'm getting hit with tons of commercials about just for your signature

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:51,300
nowadays, weirdly enough, you can end up with because you're entitled to these subsidies

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,660
and they'll send you a nice plastic card that allows you to pay for groceries and rent and

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,160
all kinds of things because you're just entitled to it.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,860
Weird that that's going on, but maybe not.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,940
No, that's the exemption.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,600
It's called a social security number.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,160
I think it's called social security in almost every country, right?

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,400
Something like it.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,980
If it's not social security, it's a social, you know, a social number or what is the other

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,740
thing they call it?

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,040
In England, it's called something else.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,760
A lot of them in England will call it like council this or that because it's issued by

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,480
the local councils that are supposed to govern an area.

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,980
So it's a council payment or a council tax.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,740
Well, not always.

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,100
Not tax accounts.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,720
Yeah.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,900
Yeah.

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,540
What what they didn't tell you was they went into a bad deal.

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,560
They didn't illegal and unlawful stuff without your consent and notice.

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,680
So since it's already done, they're giving you an exemption.

32
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,940
You're exempt from it, right?

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,320
So just like when there's an accident, they redirect traffic.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,760
You don't really stop you from going down that road.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,380
They do.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,540
It's called a banking holiday when they do stop it.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,060
But they read.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,560
Right.

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,860
So but the Bar Association attorneys are scumbags, by the way.

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,780
And I'm talking about the one percent of the attorneys that actually know what's going

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,000
on.

42
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,580
Ninety nine percent of the attorneys are just incompetent because they think they it's very

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,800
important when they go to school.

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
It's just like the CIA people.

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,000
Right.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,540
Right.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,640
I think I told you when they go through the initial phase of recruitment at CIA, they

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,640
say, OK, we've been here for a couple of weeks for initial whatever indoctrination, let's

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,820
go out in the parking lot.

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,160
Why?

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,040
You'll see.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,740
So they'll go out in the parking lot and they start raising the American flag and they have

53
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,620
a camera about knee height and whoever's knees are shaking the most when the flag is going

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,160
up are the ones that they recruit, right, because they want you to be really patriotic.

55
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,540
Right.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,060
And then they tell you that everything you're doing is to protect the republic, the constitution.

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,080
Then they start switching it to obeying orders and then it's all about obeying orders and

58
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,840
then they switch it to.

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,180
Right.

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,600
OK.

61
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,020
So the same thing with the attorneys.

62
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,700
What happens is people that want to go to law school, the ones that are smart drop out

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,860
because the reason why is they're like, you know, it's so complicated.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,600
They're not talking about any law at all.

65
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm out of here.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,500
Right.

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,560
Same with medical school.

68
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,980
You know, I want to go to become a doctor to help people.

69
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,620
They're not talking about anything about healing or how the body really works.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,100
I'm out of here.

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,460
So they give the impression, the society, that if you dropped out of law school or medical

72
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,380
school, you're done.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
It's actually the opposite.

74
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,840
Right.

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,640
So they want the dummies in there.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,080
And then they do the same thing in law school where it's they start bringing they don't

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,540
teach law.

78
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,780
By the way, you can go to like a little community college like Harvard Law School and look up

79
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,500
their curriculum.

80
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:42,960
Right.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
You know, saying that sarcastically.

82
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,020
You're not going to get any more that.

83
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah.

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,000
So you look at the curriculum.

85
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,080
They don't teach any law.

86
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,040
You'll see stuff like how to start a law clinic later on.

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,140
Well, I know a guy years ago.

88
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,900
Let me ask you this real fast, because I know a guy years ago who dropped out of both medical

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,420
and law school and, you know, he had dropped out of one and then went to the other and

90
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,280
dropped out of that one.

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,640
And he said, you know, the common thing that I found with both of these places is that

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,820
it's not about the law and it's not about the medicine.

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,920
It's actually about signing up for stuff.

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,620
They tell you how to sign up for things so you can become part of this and that.

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,060
And the third thing he said, that's the universal idea between the two things.

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,180
That's the real secret that they teach you.

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,600
That's what you're paying the money for.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,480
So you know how to get in on this and that racket.

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,640
That's literally it is.

100
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:34,840
Right.

101
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,400
Is a racket.

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Well, essentially.

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,100
All right.

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,040
The law, the law is very much tied in.

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,500
OK.

107
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Two years ago, when I had cable more than a few years ago, I turned it on real late

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,680
at night and it was C-SPAN and it was the head of the Bar Association and he's making

109
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,940
a nice initiating speech.

110
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,280
It was his first speech to the Bar Association.

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,160
You know, the first thing he said is everyone knows that in order to have a strong economy,

112
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
a strong legal system.

113
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,020
And what that means is when they charge, when people are charged with crimes, you know what

114
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,960
they call criminal law, you can't charge a human being.

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
And what they're doing is they're charging, right.

116
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,240
The exemption.

117
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,040
Right.

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,840
And they have a there's a it's not public, but there's a code for every crime and misdemeanor.

119
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,300
There's a commercial charge.

120
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,560
Actually, if you look at civil law and federal codes, it tells you that all crimes are commercial

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,020
crimes.

122
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,040
So essentially what they're doing is they're running a serious racket.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,280
It's really horrific what they're doing.

124
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,840
And I've actually met here in town in Tucson, one of the former district attorneys, and she

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
came from a prominent family.

126
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm not going to mention her name.

127
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,640
Just by saying those two things, you could find out who she is.

128
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,300
She says she was in the legal system for a couple of years and she quit because she found

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,340
out what they were doing.

130
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,340
Right.

131
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,160
So she didn't want to discuss it because that's how horrific it is.

132
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,220
But we can discuss horrific things.

133
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,920
They are horrific.

134
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,020
Most attorneys, by the way, don't have a clue, just like most doctors don't have a clue what's

135
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,640
going on there.

136
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,860
They're following along, you know.

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,640
So both things show are a testament to the robustness of the human condition.

138
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,040
In other words, you could live in a society that has no law and no medicine, really, and

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,900
still be OK because you're really tough.

140
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,040
Humans are built tough.

141
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,320
Right.

142
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,020
So, yeah.

143
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,400
So that's basically the thing.

144
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,100
What I wanted to jump to.

145
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,520
You know, that is the primary excuse, by the way, that people use for why it is they don't

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,980
challenge anything, is that, look, you know, what am I supposed to do?

147
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,520
I'm supposed to live in a society that doesn't have this, that doesn't have that.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,940
And you don't have it.

149
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,360
Well, that's the funny part.

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,640
You don't actually have it.

151
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,320
But they you know, but the fact that it's supposed to be there, right.

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,780
There's supposed to be a country.

153
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,940
There's supposed to be an army that is protecting all the people that are in this one place.

154
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,480
There's supposed to be laws that protect, you know, people that are not breaking the

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,760
laws.

156
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,080
Right.

157
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,520
Isn't that the key thing?

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
It's so funny, too.

159
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,300
You bring up everything's a commercial crime.

160
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,640
I don't know how many times I've tried to explain to people that whether you got caught

161
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,040
with, you know, eight tons of cannabis or you got caught with heroin, it's really about

162
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,100
the fact that you violated commercial codes.

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,740
Oh, well, here's the thing.

164
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,580
You can look up the the the drug laws.

165
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,200
I think it's Title 21 have been repealed, by the way.

166
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,840
What they did is they first repealed parole and then they repealed the rest of it.

167
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,820
But they're not telling anyone.

168
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,200
Right.

169
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,900
I was looking at Title 12 the other day to see if I could find anything juicy.

170
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,920
And if you go to the code online, every other section is it says omitted, omitted, omitted.

171
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
It doesn't mean it's not in effect.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,680
It's just that they're not publicly showing you what it is anymore.

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,880
I think more and more people are starting to look at it.

174
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,180
Right.

175
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,100
But what I wanted to bring up is a few things is a heavy philosophical aspect to this, where

176
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,860
the lady, you know, if you've ever heard Greek speak, especially vintage Greek speak or Greek

177
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,360
speak better.

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,660
You've heard me say several times over and over that everything that could have been

179
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,800
known was known by the late eighteen hundreds.

180
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,300
Right. And this 20th century is like the stalled century.

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
It's like it when it's like the heart that put the brakes on the whole body.

182
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,740
And yeah, you could just look at the history of 20th century and the end of the 19th

183
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,140
century. What was going on in the the end of the 19th century was there was a

184
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,100
philosophic aspect that got quashed.

185
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,740
And if you want to know what got quashed is go study Walter Russell's work, because

186
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,539
he's an offshoot of this philosophy that was growing that never really made it to the

187
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,320
20th century in print.

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,320
One of the reasons why is you hear of all these philanthropists at the late eighteen

189
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,220
hundreds, Carnegie, the Carnegie Mellon Foundation's Rockefeller.

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,640
They were building all these libraries supposedly to be philanthropists.

191
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,280
No, they were not. They were getting involved because they were removing the libraries

192
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,460
and putting in new ones.

193
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,260
Right. OK, so let's go.

194
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,680
What happened then was what if you study, let's say, the universal one, I think, Walter

195
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,300
Russell, he he kind of gets into it.

196
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,300
This is the point, like everything.

197
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
And I was a P.D.

198
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,680
Ospinski gets into this in the first few books or the book, Churcham or get them.

199
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,480
If you get into it, basically our perception makes our reality.

200
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,620
So when when you talk about banking, you talk about how it really works is an attorney, a

201
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,640
judge, a bank will stop you.

202
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,740
Yeah, but you got your car.

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,680
You want it, didn't you?

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,380
You went to the store and got milk, didn't you?

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,060
Right. You got your house, didn't you?

206
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,620
It's like a distraction, right?

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,880
Right. Because the whole thing is based on perception, like force is based is defined

208
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,180
as with matter.

209
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,140
So force is defined on something that moves matter and matter is defined as something

210
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,340
that stops a force.

211
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,940
But what if we're thinking and more than in relative terms, but in actual terms, working

212
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,200
with, quote unquote, forces that have no material counterpart, like ether and electricity

213
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
and things like that, then how do you define them?

214
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,680
And you can't the fourth dimension.

215
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,520
You see, you talk about three dimensions.

216
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,540
You've got length, width and height.

217
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,340
Right. It's all projection within our reality outward.

218
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,100
So they're looking for this fourth dimension, right, which is another projection beyond

219
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,380
length, width or height.

220
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,620
But what if the fourth dimension is the other way?

221
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,260
It's it's before length, it's before width and before height, you see, and it's

222
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
projecting that way now.

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,820
Now, right.

224
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,580
That's very spooky when you look at it.

225
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,360
You're giving example. I had a hard time this week because, you know, I build the water

226
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,380
devices. It's aqueous, aqueous borealis.

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,700
And the device is called the Mark One Scalarator.

228
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Right. So the guy who's getting is out in the country in Jersey.

229
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,160
And it was just like turbid well water that stinks.

230
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Turbid, meaning like it's yellowish tan.

231
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,660
Right. Comes out of the tap.

232
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,740
No, there are parts of well water in Jersey that come out and it just smells like rotten

233
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,900
eggs because of the.

234
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,740
Yeah, this one was more like smell like an S.O.S.

235
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,960
pad. Oh, OK.

236
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,920
That's even worse. Oh, yeah.

237
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,060
And the water was not clear.

238
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,760
I was like, this may not be the right thing.

239
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, Plummer puts it in and guess what?

240
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,580
Photograph before photograph after the water is crystal clear and tasted.

241
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,900
Smells good. Holy crap.

242
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
How is that possible?

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,760
Well, I know how it's possible.

244
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,140
I've invested the past six months of my life putting it together.

245
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,500
And I think this is my life's work in terms of making a tool or something like years

246
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,600
ago. I had a discussion, this guy, John, in Phoenix.

247
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,720
He invented he's an inventor.

248
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,480
About 30 years ago, he invented, you know, electricians.

249
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,340
They have this tool that strips the wire and cuts it at the same time.

250
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,720
It's like a pliers. Oh, yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,320
When you squeeze the pliers, it has a gear that pulls a plate that pulls the insulation

252
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,020
off and then cuts it. No, I used to.

253
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,380
It's a perfect trip. It's the perfect stripping tool.

254
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,600
I used to use that in the studio all the time because I had to make wires bare to make

255
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,040
my own. John, so we're talking about all these things.

256
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,020
You know, it's really cool to come up with stuff, you know, like that gizmos, gadgets,

257
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,940
inventions. But this is crazy.

258
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,940
I mean, think about something you bury in the ground or put them hang on the wall and

259
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,660
your plumbing, whoever your plumbing comes in the house.

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,620
And you got dirty water coming in and goes through this loop, the spool and a magnetic

261
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,100
reactor because it's starting to engineer.

262
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,160
Is it so using magnets?

263
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm like, no, yeah, it's a magnet.

264
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,780
We're not using any magnetism.

265
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,900
And he's like, so what? So are you using magnetism or not?

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,160
No, it's a magnetic reactor.

267
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,340
There's a magnet present, but it's not.

268
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,980
But it's not using magnetism.

269
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,080
Well, if you want to stop the device from working, go ahead and apply the magnetism to

270
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
the flow and you'll see everything stops.

271
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,540
It's kind of like you want to get the word reactor.

272
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,040
It's like nuclear reactors.

273
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,360
You only have time to hear it now.

274
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,860
They use nuclear reactors to heat water, to drive turbines.

275
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,480
Now, the purpose of that is just to give to the reactor nuclear reactor to produce heat,

276
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,080
not to put radiation in the water.

277
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,520
Same principle. The magnetic reactor is there to unleash the potential of the water's

278
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,600
ability to clean itself.

279
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,300
And yes, water does clean itself.

280
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,260
The way you can witness that is when you have I don't want to make this a talk about

281
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,480
water, but just if anyone says, how does water clean itself?

282
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,160
Go look at either Google Earth, which is a still photo or live photos.

283
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,580
If you can't find them, video of when the confluence of rivers flowing into the ocean

284
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,900
or sea. What happens is right before the river water falls into the sea or the ocean,

285
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,720
it starts foaming on its banks.

286
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
You can see it on Google Earth.

287
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

288
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,160
The foam is there because the river is like being apologetic.

289
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,300
It's like, you know, I've got all this stuff in here and I don't want to dump it into

290
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,200
you. So let's remove as much as we can right now.

291
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,980
So it starts to foam and it dumps all the dirt off the banks and then it delivers the

292
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,500
cleanest water it can do in that short time to the sea or the tributary or wherever it

293
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,780
goes. Very interesting phenomenon.

294
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,640
So then if you study, for example, I wouldn't say Moto because he did a lot of

295
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,700
exclusions. You know, he's the guy that shows the water positive energy and negative

296
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,300
energy, you know, pretty and ugly.

297
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,400
Right. He did all exclusion.

298
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,760
So his experiments, people can't repeat them because he took 2000 pictures and he only

299
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,380
shows you two. And you think he just took two pictures.

300
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,280
He omitted all the ones that didn't show anything.

301
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Right. And he didn't tell you he took 2000 pictures to get those two either.

302
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,560
So everybody's like, oh, well, I'll try it doesn't work.

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,840
You know, so whatever. So that's exclusions that he does.

304
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,400
The medical industry is like that, too.

305
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,340
But history is like that.

306
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,640
But the whole Veda Austin hydroglyphs, Veda Austin, you could look her up.

307
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,380
I always make a comment. She's so bedroomy.

308
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,760
Every time she shows up in a video, she she's like bedroomy.

309
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,120
She puts on like like she looks like she just got disheveled in the bedroom.

310
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,160
You know, she's very bedroomy, like when a woman's going to go to the bedroom.

311
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,980
OK, gotcha. Yeah, that's her.

312
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,900
That's her. That's how she sees herself.

313
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Kind of like when I was growing up, you notice how women, as they get older,

314
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,640
they always stick with a style that they that resembles

315
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,520
when they thought they were the prettiest.

316
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
But what I mean by that is like when I was growing up in the 60s, 70s and 80s,

317
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
I noticed even in the 80s, like my friend's mom,

318
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,240
who thought she was the prettiest, probably in the 50s, still had the 50s hairdo.

319
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,800
Right. Right. Because that's what she was happiest with.

320
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,160
You know, anyway, that's a that's a whole other discussion.

321
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,780
Anyway, we like you, Veda.

322
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,100
But all right. So, yeah, interesting stuff.

323
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,820
Interesting, very interesting stuff.

324
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,940
So so by the way, on a personal note, because of this water device,

325
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,360
my reality is is like I'm dreaming, you know, it's like wherever this thing goes,

326
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,380
it's you expect one X or two X and it does 10 X.

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
And it's like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, this is pretty incredible stuff.

328
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,420
And by the way, I put out for, you know, stuff on how to build.

329
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
We've gone much further than that.

330
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,140
There's a lot of treatments, you know, to build this thing and slight transmutations.

331
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah. So anyway, well, that's anyone interested in that?

332
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,240
Yeah, that's the key word I was waiting for is transmutation,

333
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
because I was thinking to myself that, you know, indeed, even the quality of your air.

334
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,780
I've seen people change the quality of air by by putting out things

335
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,380
that if somebody looks at it from a pure engineering standpoint,

336
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,820
it makes no sense, but somehow you have less debris in the air

337
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,520
if you place these things around and they're of particular colors

338
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,060
and they're made of particular components.

339
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,460
And it just simply changes the quality of the air in an area. Right.

340
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm thinking it's a similar principle to what's happening with the water.

341
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,800
Yeah. Here's a way to start the way to do that.

342
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,380
Believe it or not, piezoelectrics, you know, when you piezoelectrics

343
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,440
in essence is if you put electricity in a crystal,

344
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,900
it vibrates or if you vibrate a crystal, it gives off electricity. Right.

345
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,440
Yeah. Like I have a cigarette lighter that you when you click, it makes a loud click

346
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,319
because it's a little hammer that hits a crystal that gives off a spark. Right.

347
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,339
So, yeah, that's when you hear some ovens and you hear click, click, click, click.

348
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,359
Right. So all that the pilotless starters and all that piezoelectrics.

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,400
All right. So what you do is you find yourself a big honking crystal,

350
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,720
big meaning like more than three or four inches and get a C clamp.

351
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,080
Like the kind of carpenters use, you get them, seen them at the dollar store. Sure.

352
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,020
And go ahead and start clamping on that crystal.

353
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,860
Make it nice and tight, but don't break it.

354
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,940
Right. Go as tight as you can without breaking it. Right.

355
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,400
So and you'll know how much pressure is on that because, you know,

356
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,140
if you put a C clamp on your finger and you start turning it,

357
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,720
you could really feel it. Right. Yeah.

358
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,560
So so get a sense to do it on your finger first.

359
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,880
So you know how much of a turn does how much of a squeeze, believe it or not,

360
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,960
get get an organic gauge going. Right. Put it on your big toe.

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,540
Don't put it on anything else.

362
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,960
But, yeah, get a feeling when you when you start pinching with that clamp

363
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,940
and part of your body, how fast it gets tight.

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,000
Right. Before you do it on the crystal. Right.

365
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,440
So then do it on the crystal. Keep it tight.

366
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,660
Put the crystal in the corner of the room. Leave the room.

367
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
Come back a half hour later.

368
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,100
Talk about air quality change big time.

369
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,700
Right. Yeah. These are these are small things.

370
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm going to be getting more into this in the future about induction

371
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,720
and a little little tricks and tips like this.

372
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,040
And we're going to put some things together.

373
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,340
And, yeah, listeners of Greek speak will be on a whole other level.

374
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,300
Practical devices that are pretty incredible.

375
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,220
So well, that's why these people were encasing these crystals.

376
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,820
And I don't know if you remember this.

377
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
This was kind of fashionable about 10 years ago.

378
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,160
They were encasing them in this like plastic type substance.

379
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,540
So organize stuff.

380
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,780
This is different because you can't.

381
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,360
Yeah, those things do compress a little bit.

382
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,400
But you have no control over the compression.

383
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,580
Each crystal should get a little different compression.

384
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,840
Well, that's the problem is that you can create a result with this.

385
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
But it does vary. It's not the same.

386
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,560
It's not. Yeah, it's not the same thing.

387
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,780
But I'm just saying, yeah.

388
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,820
And certain crystals don't like being near other materials.

389
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,420
Like, for example, if you have aluminum powder and copper powder

390
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,880
and you put it in that plastic matrix, you know, the aluminum and by the way,

391
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,220
powder, aluminum and copper don't like each other. Right.

392
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,540
But aluminum powder and copper powder hate each other.

393
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,080
I hate you. Get away from me.

394
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,060
But you force them in a in a in a plastic matrix, epoxy or crystals.

395
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,720
And now you got this natural thing.

396
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,260
So and I hate you. I hate you, too.

397
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,720
I hate you. I hate you, too.

398
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,860
All day and all night.

399
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,740
Yeah. And these people think it's good.

400
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,560
You know, I wouldn't do that.

401
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,100
Yeah. So the simplest thing. Right.

402
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,420
Like your basic course that you could find, you know, on the ground

403
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,660
almost anywhere, that stuff gets along with everybody, you know.

404
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,440
Yes. So speaking of getting along in the chat, someone put on about property

405
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,840
ownership when you get a house or something like that.

406
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,520
Well, oh, yes.

407
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,280
The philosophical part of this still holds.

408
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,080
In other words, you're not going to get lawful money.

409
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,860
Silver and gold don't work no more.

410
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,240
It's just like saying cars are polluting.

411
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,160
So let's bring back horse and carriage.

412
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,400
Ain't going to happen. Right.

413
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,880
And here's the thing.

414
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,180
If you try to make it happen, you're going to be like,

415
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,540
yeah, when I had a car, I didn't use it for a week.

416
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,440
It just sat there.

417
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,960
But if I have a horse and I don't use it for a week, you got to feed it.

418
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,040
You got to water it every day.

419
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,720
You got to let it walk around some, too.

420
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,440
You can't leave it sitting there a long time because it doesn't work around.

421
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,580
So you got to check with the Amish on this to see how that works.

422
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,280
You know what I mean?

423
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,360
Yeah. So it's not going to work.

424
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,620
The lawful money, what they did, what they did is basically the twelve

425
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,160
USC for 11 USC.

426
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,420
That would be how would you say that, Uncle Sam?

427
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,100
Cat or Uncle Sam?

428
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,860
Cradle USC, United States Code

429
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,840
12 for 11. Right.

430
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,060
I think Charlie used to be the way they would do the Charlie.

431
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,340
Yeah, there you go.

432
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,980
OK, yeah.

433
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,680
So United States Code Title 12 Section 411 is the remedy.

434
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,980
And it's also in the original Federal Reserve Act.

435
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,580
And and they've right.

436
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,260
So basically all it's like in a form of exemption.

437
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,680
You just make a demand for lawful money.

438
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,860
All you have to do is make a demand for lawful money.

439
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,340
But you have to maintain good records to show that you've made your demand

440
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,900
and dated. Right.

441
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,940
And what that does, it sort of keeps you free from all those shenanigans.

442
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,600
It's kind of like when the mob goes into a club

443
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,360
and tells everyone the low level mob put their wallets on the table

444
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,580
and you don't put your wallet on the table and you say,

445
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,820
well, because I'm a Gambino.

446
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,460
Right. Why did you put your wallet on your table?

447
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
Because I'm a Gambino.

448
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,380
Were they going to say, oh, yeah, OK, that's right.

449
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,040
Next one. Right. Right.

450
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,800
They're going to take it from the Schwartz and they're going to take it

451
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,260
from the Pollyanna guy. Right.

452
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,540
So you kind of exempt.

453
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,940
So it's about record keeping.

454
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
So if you do have a piece of property or something, whoever you got it from,

455
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,600
send them something back saying that the deal was done in lawful money.

456
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,860
And also while you're doing the deal, the payments or whatever,

457
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,320
you make a note in the memo.

458
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,020
Anytime you have a check or whatever, there's a memo line.

459
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,380
Put lawful money, 12 USC, 411.

460
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,920
So you have something to to stand on. Right.

461
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,820
It's all about record keeping.

462
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,580
They switched over.

463
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,160
You see, the Bolsheviks went into Russia and they did what they did.

464
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,300
They did the same thing here, but differently.

465
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,440
In other words, a takeover.

466
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,100
The takeover here was done financially, taking control of the money

467
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,660
because even then, Americans just had too many guns. Right.

468
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,360
And they were too spread out.

469
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,800
So, yeah, sorry to be the bearer of bad news and good news.

470
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,260
See all bad news.

471
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,560
See, if bad news is helpful to know, it's really not all that bad, is it?

472
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,780
This is this has a good aspect to it also. Right. Right.

473
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,520
Well, you can learn from look, it sucks that people had to suffer or whatever.

474
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,340
But now we know what not to do.

475
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,820
You know, right. That's why ever since you've known me in private,

476
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,260
I said, did you do it in a conditional endorsement?

477
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,480
You know, you do conditional endorsement.

478
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,720
It's just got to keep. Oh, the other thing.

479
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,700
So in other words, I don't have much more to say on no one owns anything.

480
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,360
No one owns anything because they can't.

481
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
They don't exist. Right.

482
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,180
They only if their premise of any government or administration

483
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,920
is they exist on the power of the people.

484
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,320
If they're screwing the people, you can't go to them and say,

485
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,200
why are you screwing us?

486
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,660
Because they've stopped existing before they started screwing you

487
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,640
in order to screw you.

488
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,800
OK, OK. So. All right.

489
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,920
Go, go think of that a little bit.

490
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm not going to repeat that. I don't know if I can't.

491
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,160
No, I'm just wrapping my mind around it or trying to hear.

492
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,820
Yeah, it's you got it. You got to first.

493
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,420
Look, if they don't exist, you can't go back on the power of the people

494
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,160
and for the people, by the people.

495
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,700
And you see that they're screwing you.

496
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,480
You can't go to them anymore because it's not the same government.

497
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,560
And it's right because they had to not be the same government

498
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,040
in order to screw you, of course, because if they were the same government,

499
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,740
they were screwing you.

500
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,980
They are their options. They'd have to answer for it.

501
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,960
Right. But now because they don't care,

502
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
it's obviously not the same one.

503
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,760
It's kind of like

504
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,240
men in black.

505
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,100
It starts off with the roach takes over the guy's body.

506
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,520
He's in a suit.

507
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,560
The wife is like sitting there with the lemonade.

508
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,580
I don't know if you remember the first men in black movie.

509
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,060
Yeah, he was in an Edgar suit.

510
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,600
Edgar. Yeah. OK, so the government is like in an Edgar suit.

511
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,740
It's not don't go there.

512
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,940
That's a it's a big bug, right?

513
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,500
They don't exist anymore.

514
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,060
And I keep telling you, they don't exist.

515
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,720
I mean, they tell you they don't exist.

516
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,740
It's around the Civil War.

517
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
They shut down Congress.

518
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,640
They call it close a Latin term for meaning no more day.

519
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,220
And so they just show up as a formality. Right.

520
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,900
Yeah. So it's like having a birthday party for someone who's no longer alive.

521
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,680
That's been done, too. You know what I mean?

522
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,500
Yeah. So it's all it's all just formalities.

523
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,200
That's why these things are on their end are getting worse and worse and worse.

524
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,640
So speaking of formality, somebody did mention in chat this idea

525
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
about possibly being able to use a signature with PayPal or something.

526
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,160
I don't know. Yes, that's what I would.

527
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
George, thank you very much. Yes, I'm going from memory.

528
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,960
He did bring up this is what they did.

529
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,620
I have not looked at it yet for reasons I may have mentioned earlier

530
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,580
what's going on with the water stuff right now.

531
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,260
So I really you know, I'm so excited that sitting down on the Internet

532
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,480
to even look at the chat for three minutes is a big takeaway from what I'm doing.

533
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,720
So, you know, so.

534
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,620
I will look at that, but I did see that.

535
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,000
In other words, I didn't look at the video that he put in.

536
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,860
So I would suggest that that's what Lawful Money Trust is doing.

537
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,940
You can go and, you know, reach out to those guys.

538
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,780
They're very confidential, let's say

539
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,520
they do have a saving to suitors for them.

540
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,080
OK, go look at the successes and all that around there.

541
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,980
And that would be I don't endorse them fully,

542
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,860
but that's the way to go on the 12 USC for 11.

543
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,120
There's a lot of people in jail, by the way.

544
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,360
And there's no one in jail for tax evasion ever.

545
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,400
If you look at the court document that was called the charging instrument,

546
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,600
you know that that has to when they when they put them in jail or prison,

547
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,600
they the prison has to get a charging instrument.

548
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,100
You know, in other words, a formal record of why they should be.

549
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,700
And you look at the charging instrument says false information,

550
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,200
a government official, not tax evasion.

551
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,600
Right. Martha Stewart's the same thing.

552
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,260
Everyone thinks, oh, is insider trading.

553
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,760
Well, no, she gave she did an interview and they said,

554
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,240
oh, you gave false information here.

555
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,040
The lollipop was blue, not green. So here you go.

556
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,360
So if you listen carefully to a lot of news stories,

557
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,940
you'll find that that's exactly what goes on.

558
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,580
It's lying to the FBI. It's lying to a federal agent.

559
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,040
It's just starting to tell you.

560
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,640
And by the way, what they do, these

561
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,500
all the all the any agency in the alphabet agency is not government, by the way.

562
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,020
They're all put in.

563
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,400
They're not government, as you're taught in civil civics

564
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,080
when they used to teach it.

565
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,620
What they are is they're franchises of the Federal Reserve

566
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,220
of the central banking system.

567
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,340
Right. Like the FBI was started by the Jewish mafia, by the way.

568
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,440
You know, before that, it was they had another group.

569
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
It was the oh, some they used to Pinkerton's.

570
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,500
Right. Right.

571
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,160
And the Pinkerton's were like they were they had

572
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,420
those armored, armored trucks and armored wagons. Right.

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
And the FBI came out when they when they were Pinkerton's were too corrupt.

574
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,360
They said, we need something else.

575
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,120
So the the American Jews in New York said, we got an answer for that.

576
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,920
We'll fund that.

577
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,740
And they structured it all.

578
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,280
And that's what the FBI is.

579
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,140
Anybody who was a veteran in the FBI knows what I'm telling you.

580
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,320
By the way, that's where I got it from.

581
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,600
What that went into is two things actually went into the Bureau of Investigation,

582
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,220
which was not yet the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

583
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,560
And then it also went into the Secret Service

584
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,440
because the Secret Service at that time was mainly charged with.

585
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,860
And if you notice, Pinkerton's did security in quotes. Right.

586
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,880
Right. They ended up saying that name exists in security somehow.

587
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,760
I think it still is.

588
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,280
You know, Pinkerton still exists, but it doesn't have the same,

589
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,320
you know, responsibility.

590
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,160
Yeah. Just like the. Yeah.

591
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,660
But so here's what's going on through the years.

592
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,880
It's like, why are they busting all the guineas, the Italians, the lops?

593
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,800
We got to bust the Jew here and there to make it seem OK.

594
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,860
So so what's going on with people of every every

595
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,280
decade or two?

596
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,060
They have to bust someone in the public eye for tax evasion to scare all the people

597
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,780
like the first one was Max Schliemann, who was a boxer

598
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,460
in the 50s. And then they did.

599
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,480
Who's the. Oh, Schmeling.

600
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,080
Schmeling, you mean, right?

601
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
Schmeling. Yeah, yeah. Schleiman or Schmeling.

602
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,740
Schmeling. Schmeling was Schleiman.

603
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,080
But OK, either way, Schmeling.

604
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
Schmeling was a heavyweight champion.

605
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,040
And that's right. And he got they made him fight again to pay the bill.

606
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
And he got beat up by a young guy.

607
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,080
So it goes on and on.

608
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,460
And then it was the woman, the real tacky woman that owned Park Avenue

609
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,440
South, Leona, Park Avenue, Leona.

610
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,580
Yeah. And then it was Willie Nelson.

611
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,400
And then the black guy. What's his name?

612
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,000
The actor, Wesley Snipes.

613
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,360
See, I know all these guys.

614
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

615
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,940
So they so they put these famous people.

616
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,700
So I was like, oh, my gosh, I better.

617
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,280
Right. So that's how much power they have.

618
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,860
Why? Because you endorse it.

619
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,320
You endorse it. Everybody's endorsing it.

620
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,380
And, you know, you want to go along with it.

621
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,820
You know, and that's that's the whole thing.

622
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,380
You cannot change this because the majority of the people want it that way.

623
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,040
So what you do is you have your own reality within the reality

624
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,740
and your reality within the reality is how do you make your reality

625
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,200
better within this reality?

626
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,920
That's the DNA of Greek speak.

627
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,240
The DNA of Greek speak is figure out what's going on,

628
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,380
what's really going on, demand definitions.

629
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,500
Right. Right. Demand histories, what things really are.

630
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
So you can make a better decision.

631
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm not telling you to do anything ever.

632
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,400
The DNA of Greek speak is definition.

633
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,020
Define, define, define.

634
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,160
And when you're done with that, define some more

635
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,720
and try to be objective as possible, because you really can't be objective

636
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,920
because your senses are always lying to you anyway. So.

637
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,580
You know, like recently, I was teaching someone how to do watch flicker rate.

638
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,220
You know, these LED lights, you know, they have flicker rate of 60 cycle per second.

639
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,960
If you look away from the light, have the light behind you

640
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,480
and try to look at your peripheral vision, you'll see the flicker.

641
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,080
But if you turn around, look at it straight ahead.

642
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,840
You don't see the flicker only from your peripheral vision.

643
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,220
Right. And I'm not talking about where they show a video of a brand new car.

644
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,460
And it looks like the headlights are blinking

645
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,060
because that's the flicker rate conflicting with the camera.

646
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,040
Yeah, that's because of the frame rate. Right.

647
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,800
That's the frame rate versus flicker rate of the pulsing of the P

648
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,880
pulse with modulation in the amplifier, the driver of the light.

649
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,500
So. Right.

650
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,320
So what happens when you look at the wheels of a car with your peripheral?

651
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,420
Yeah, I was just saying, same thing happens if you look at the wheels of a car

652
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,560
and you notice a lot of times they look like they're going backwards.

653
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,140
It's because the film rate is conflicting with the flicker rate of the light on it.

654
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,780
Is it really conflicting?

655
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,700
No, because it really looks like it's really going backwards.

656
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,100
You can you could swear that those wheels look like they're going backwards

657
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,720
and you wouldn't be wrong.

658
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
You wouldn't be right.

659
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,640
But you won't be wrong either, because anyone visually see,

660
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,540
that's exactly where the perception lies.

661
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,760
You see, we are only as good as our perception.

662
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,800
But if you get speed, though, you can actually see him roll forward

663
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,020
if you adjust the speed properly.

664
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,540
Sure, sure. But but it's the whole thing like they lie and you swear to it.

665
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,900
Right. Like 500 people cut a woman in half.

666
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,920
500 people in the audience watching a magician

667
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,160
cut a woman in half and put her back together.

668
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
If you don't know how that trick is done.

669
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,120
Five hundred people.

670
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
Can you sign right here that you swear that you saw a woman cut in half?

671
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes, I will sign that. I will swear.

672
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,160
So basically they lie and you swear to their lies.

673
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,720
And it ain't going to change going back to that.

674
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
It ain't going to change.

675
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,700
Well, after all, you did see the guy pull a pigeon out of the lady's ear

676
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,760
who was sitting in the front row.

677
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,280
I mean, you saw it, didn't you?

678
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,620
By the way, do you know how the sawing in half trick works?

679
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,200
Well, I mean, there's a bunch of different ways that it can work,

680
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,180
but I know what that's like.

681
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,380
Well, the way the way to do it and pull it off.

682
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,280
It's difficult because you need to magicians when they always around a big city,

683
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,020
international city, because they need people with special skills. Right.

684
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,060
This is how it's done.

685
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,740
The box is never just big enough to hold one person.

686
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,000
It has to be big enough to hold two people. Right.

687
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,980
So what happens is where the woman standing before she gets in the box

688
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,400
is already another woman in the box who's all contorted is in the bottom half.

689
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,120
Yeah. And as the woman is getting in the box,

690
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,820
they have to time it just right that she's ready to slide her legs through the box.

691
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,440
It's the other woman that slides the legs through the box.

692
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,500
Yeah. But you got to make sure her legs go down away from the saw.

693
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,420
Yeah. You got to make sure they're wearing the same shoes.

694
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,440
Otherwise it looks crazy.

695
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,200
You know, you can't go in there like the hard part is the timing.

696
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,180
You make it look like the legs look the same.

697
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,840
Well, you got to make sure the shoes are the same.

698
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,300
You can't have a woman walk on stage.

699
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,180
That's right. That would be out the bottom.

700
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,200
That would suck. I mean, you know, just saying.

701
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,120
Good. Yeah, that would be worse than finding a passport

702
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,320
on the roof of a building from a burning airplane.

703
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Right. Yeah. Something that melted a building, but couldn't get a passport.

704
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,140
It's really weird. Right.

705
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,620
So, you know, don't don't stick sneakers out when the woman walked on stage with pumps.

706
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,460
That's all I'm saying. Yeah.

707
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,420
And they do get let's say you do have a magician doing the ledger domain or press

708
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,460
the digitization.

709
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,020
But most people have heard of press the digitization.

710
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,540
But just about everyone ever brought up ledger domain has never heard of it.

711
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,620
Ledger domain, L.A.G.R. domain anyway, is a magic tricks.

712
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,060
Food, tomfoolery or whatever that.

713
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,240
So if you go to a place where banks are doing their business and you start saying,

714
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,480
you know, do a forensic audit where he's got money to give you, he's got no money.

715
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,520
He's monetizing your signature.

716
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,540
They get very nervous, just like a magician when he's ready to perform the act.

717
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,540
And you're sitting in the back yelling out.

718
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,580
He's already got another woman in the box.

719
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,260
You know, they have people that throw you out.

720
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,220
Right. There's a lot of money there. Right.

721
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,820
Yeah. Same thing.

722
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,640
So I've spoken to bankers about fractionalization.

723
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,980
One guy's brains. Yeah. Ten to one. We do ten to one.

724
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,300
Yeah. We do. We take your signature.

725
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,179
We get ten to one out of that. Yeah.

726
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,480
What? You got a problem with that? They don't.

727
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,500
They got everything they want that way.

728
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,219
So do we. So fuck off.

729
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,480
Right. Oh, my God.

730
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
You came in to get the hundred dollars.

731
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,480
You got your hundred dollars and we made a thousand out of it.

732
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,040
What do you care?

733
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,080
Yeah. Well, nine hundred. Yeah.

734
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,659
Well, actually, eight hundred because they turned it into nine hundred.

735
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,000
Gave you the hundred. Right.

736
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,780
They have the eight hundred left over.

737
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,560
They do have to pay taxes on that, by the way, unless they're a member

738
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,780
bank of the Federal Reserve.

739
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,520
Most banks are not member.

740
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,840
By the way, banks are not corporations and they're not their national associations.

741
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,020
That's why we look at Wells Fargo and a right national national associations

742
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,780
like the Sierra Club, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts.

743
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,580
It's a vague Smithsonian Institute's National Association.

744
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,480
It's like these in between things. Right.

745
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,320
So anyway. Yeah.

746
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,000
Those are the two things I wanted to cover that were in the chat was

747
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,660
there's no ownership.

748
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,980
Just you just want to get them out of your hair.

749
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,700
Just show keep records that you've made demand for lawful money

750
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,800
every step of the way.

751
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,540
And the property tax, I kind of got into a little bit.

752
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,960
There's a guy that I would endorse is Steve property tax.

753
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,380
Steve, Steve of Florida.

754
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,260
I don't know if he maybe got rid of his stuff,

755
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,780
but basically his whole thing is you just stick with one thing.

756
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,060
People are not mentioned under tax laws.

757
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,540
It says persons.

758
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,300
It says corporations, trusts, organizations, this and that.

759
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,900
People are not in there. So you're out.

760
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,940
The other thing is property taxes, which says nonprofits don't do property tax.

761
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,880
Doesn't say 501 C three.

762
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,580
It can't. They can't use any.

763
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,800
They say, do you obey the codes of the IRS?

764
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,880
There's 60 million, 60,000 pages.

765
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,720
Which one don't you know has nothing to do with the IRS?

766
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,280
So again, where you live, if you don't have a profit

767
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,940
doing anything for profit where you live, and by the way,

768
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,520
you cannot profit in a credit based economy here.

769
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I'll throw another thing at you.

770
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,460
One of the things that they omitted in Title 12

771
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,140
when I was looking at was it says that banks, member banks

772
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,340
and bank associations cannot lend credit and they cannot lend

773
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,260
credit credit that's on deposit or deposits of accounts.

774
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,540
So what are they lending you?

775
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,500
Right. They're not allowed to be lending at all.

776
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,880
It's really wild.

777
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,660
And this was one of this.

778
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,320
I think it was under 95 or 95 B.

779
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,760
And it says omitted.

780
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,060
So they're starting to move, you know, on this.

781
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,340
It's kind of like, you know,

782
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,580
it was quite well known in the engineering community before 9-11

783
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,360
that there were nukes underneath the U.N.

784
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,340
building, underneath the Dag Hammarskjöld building,

785
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,480
underneath the World Trade Center.

786
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,500
The janitor knew it, right?

787
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,140
It was spoken.

788
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,820
It was it was even an article in The New York Times

789
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,120
where the janitor was interviewed.

790
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,040
Yeah, this nuclear

791
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,600
device under the building for an emergency, you know.

792
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,640
But after 9-11, oh, no, no, we got to omit all that.

793
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,440
Right. So, yeah, same thing with the banking.

794
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,360
I think what's happening is because it's going critical on what they're doing.

795
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,080
And by the way, when they do the subsidy thing, if you sign and get money,

796
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
you know, they produce not ten to one.

797
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,880
And now you're going to you know, I was telling people,

798
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,640
if you're going to sign that stimulus check that you're getting in the mail,

799
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,580
whatever is a thousand, three thousand, whatever,

800
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,100
you're going to pay for it ten times through inflation over the next few years.

801
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,820
And what I said is actually pretty accurate.

802
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,560
The average cost has gone up 80 percent on average on many things.

803
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,180
Right. 80 percent.

804
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,180
Right. Almost double. So, yeah.

805
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,460
Right. Just take a look at a used car.

806
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,980
You could have got one for a thousand dollars not too long ago.

807
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,940
Guess what? They're about five thousand now,

808
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,300
you know, for the same thing that you could have bought.

809
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Basically, you know, comparably same amount of years old.

810
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,420
You know, it's like five to one, four to one.

811
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,320
It's still not as bad as the late 70s, by the way.

812
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
No, the inflation in the late 70s was worse.

813
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,980
But it's it's it's going in the in other words, the state to the state.

814
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,640
Yeah. Well, this thing is almost the same.

815
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,040
It's you know, right.

816
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,180
It's like if you get shot with four bullets or six bullets.

817
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,560
Yeah. You know, you still a lot of bullets to get hit with.

818
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,640
Right. No, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah.

819
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,260
I don't know if there's anything else we can get into a bit.

820
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,580
I just want to maybe keep this kind of short and then finally

821
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,960
to put a cap on the financial thing that I talked about.

822
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,520
But basically anything

823
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,500
anything you do, you have to show that you made a demand.

824
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,360
So electronic stuff is out unless you could show it electronically.

825
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,540
So if you get this direct deposit. Right. Right.

826
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,520
Get rid of a demand to check. Right.

827
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,700
And if they say we don't do that, we do is if the direct deposit

828
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,880
into an account, we do is just close the account.

829
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,220
And then when they send the direct deposit, it's going to bounce back

830
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,960
and they're going to know.

831
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,140
And then you go to the office a week, I say, yeah, I didn't get anything.

832
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,300
Yeah, because it bounced back.

833
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,860
Well, you write me a check.

834
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,500
And when you get the check on the back of the check, you do the demand

835
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,620
for lawful money per 12 per 12 USC for 11.

836
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,500
At the end of the year, you make a copy of that for you,

837
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,760
deposit it or cash it and you keep all that.

838
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,380
And when you give an IRS paperwork, you just fill it out like you're supposed to.

839
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,900
But at the bottom, your total is zero.

840
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,240
And you say, why?

841
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,260
Because I redeemed it all for lawful money.

842
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,120
And they're like, OK, well, have you got any checks that you didn't sign that way?

843
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,360
We could tax those, you know.

844
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,300
So, you know, they're very they're very cordial about it.

845
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,660
But the problem is with the IRS or the police or whatever, they don't know anything.

846
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,980
So you're going to have to go to a higher, you know, higher up the ladder.

847
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,780
Yeah. So.
