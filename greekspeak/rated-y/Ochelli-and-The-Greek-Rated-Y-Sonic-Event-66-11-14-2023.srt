1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,600
Sonic Event 66, and you know what, I think it's time to go around the world because we

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,680
got two of the numbers that represent man, I guess, standing next to each other if we're

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,940
going according to the numerology.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,900
But then again, maybe not.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,000
Greek, how are you doing tonight?

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,560
Hey, I'm doing it, yeah.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,080
We've been looking at palindromes, by the way, so when we did, let's say, 62, we looked

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,660
at 26.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,500
I think we started further on.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,080
So we do episode 64, we looked at 46 and see if there's any kind of a rhythm there.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,720
And it's interesting how you could know and want to use that as a tool, which I don't

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,540
think we really did.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,880
But yeah, 66, we went around the world on episode 6.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,640
You're making that noise again, by the way.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,480
Oh, OK.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,020
Really?

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,900
Oh, OK.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,220
Because this is a new headset and it's getting used to me.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,620
You shouldn't be making that noise now, though.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,680
No, I just was.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,080
All right, let's just try it.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,500
It's just like one of those, it's an Apple headset with a built-in mic on the stupid

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,840
rectangle, which is an Apple or a pair, right?

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,320
And yeah, I've gotten away from the laptop for some reason, I just like it.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
I could see the convenience, even though the phones are way too big.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,260
You know, I'm used to a flip phone, so you probably hear a lot of resolution on it.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,360
Yeah, I am.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,900
But I was hearing that noise a bit.

29
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,800
What would you do with a pair of apples, though, right?

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,100
Yeah, right.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,400
Right.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,700
Right.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,000
A pair of something else, too.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,560
That too.

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,700
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,440
If you got them.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Do you got a pair?

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,560
Do you not got a pair?

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
What kind of pair does she have?

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Anyway.

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,280
All right.

42
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,820
Now we've got.

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,120
Yeah.

44
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,360
Yeah.

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,520
Well, it takes a pounding.

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,280
I heard, though.

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,680
Yeah.

48
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,980
We keep taking and licking and all that.

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,560
All right.

50
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,900
So away from it and away from what's going on.

51
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,020
The world is a crazy place, man.

52
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,360
It really is.

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,320
You know, we're all being pranked.

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,460
We keep going over that.

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,160
We've done that.

56
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:07,940
Oh, I don't know.

57
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,240
Since we started talking, you know, it has.

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,020
It's not.

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,860
It's not that crazy.

60
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,540
It's not that bad.

61
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,500
You know, it's getting better.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,340
It's actually much better than it was.

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,220
All right.

64
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,220
In short.

65
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,780
In short.

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,980
What do I mean by that?

67
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,960
In short, there's YouTube videos or videos on replicating life in the eighteen hundreds

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,840
or seventeen hundreds.

69
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,840
Go watch it.

70
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,560
All right.

71
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,960
Now, I'm presuming you might see the one that I saw a decade ago.

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,880
So, you know, people get up in the morning.

73
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,240
Right.

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
And it's really cold because no one was tending the fire at night.

75
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,180
Let's say if it's in the cold season and someone's got to go get wood.

76
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,800
Other people got to get ready to make something to eat or drink.

77
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,040
You got laundry to do by hand.

78
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,380
Right.

79
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,300
Good.

80
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,800
You see.

81
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,160
Right.

82
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
No machines to help.

83
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,800
No grid.

84
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,200
And by the way, what I mean by no grid in back in the 19th century, in most places in

85
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,420
the world, even in a big city, you didn't have running water, running water.

86
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,620
There was one spigot in a building or two.

87
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,200
And you had bowls that you moved around if you had access pictures of water, you know,

88
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,820
if you had access to, you know, to for washing, bathing was a big deal.

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,020
Laundry was a big deal.

90
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,340
Usually people didn't do laundry on their own.

91
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,980
Very often they were laundering was very popular, you know, going to a launderer.

92
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,000
But again, economically and all that.

93
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,560
So we're way better off.

94
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,500
The part that's not better off is there's an aspect to get away with what we should be

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,860
doing.

96
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,980
And one thing that I would say maybe the past three Sonics we've covered is how banking and

97
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,180
money works and covered how the attorneys are scumbags and this and that and the other

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,360
and the doctors and all that.

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,620
Right.

100
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,040
Right.

101
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,000
They're not actually all those systems work really well.

102
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,360
See, the system is not.

103
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,480
But there's a set of rules that have been hammered out literally for these professions

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,000
to follow based on keeping standards, you know, and no one is following them and no one cares.

105
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,399
No one's holding their feet to the fire, so to speak.

106
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,680
And it's just chugging along and it's still doing OK.

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,460
Pretty much.

108
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,640
Pretty much.

109
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,220
The only thing I wanted to include in this that that people that were doing OK is this

110
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,400
concept of war.

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,280
That is a sport.

112
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,240
So if you like watching like contact sports especially and you complain about war, you

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,820
got no business because it's the same exact thing.

114
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,900
As a matter of fact, where wars take place, the battlefields are called theaters, aren't

115
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,140
they?

116
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,760
Yes, they are.

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,820
Yeah.

118
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,000
So this is just sport, blood sport, however you want to call it.

119
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,020
It has nothing to do with morality, of course.

120
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,540
And very simply, you could see the reasons why going to war is given.

121
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,040
And there's always a war, you know, when these things pop up like what's going on right now

122
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,640
in the Middle East, you know, it's going on.

123
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,540
Always is just whether you hear about it or not.

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,080
Right.

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,700
I had a conversation with someone recently and the word terrorism came up.

126
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,380
I said, there is no such thing as terrorism, as you're being told.

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,520
It's all state sponsored, not by the elected officials, those that are not elected.

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:40,620
And the money people to create a motivation for that will allow the public to accept things

129
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,200
that they normally would not accept, sort of like the Hegelian dialectic.

130
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,380
Right.

131
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,080
That's all it is.

132
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,420
There is real terrorism, but you never hear about it.

133
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,520
Right.

134
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
Only everything that is that you hear about on a large scale of that that's printed or

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,120
put through the airwaves, even in alternative media is all scripted.

136
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,700
Right.

137
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,880
So we've got a lot of busy little piggies behind the scenes.

138
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,540
And that's what people focus on.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
Is it not being such a good world?

140
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,820
Is the people that are busy dividing everyone and because people get along no matter what.

141
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,680
Right.

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:13,820
Right.

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,300
It doesn't matter your race, color, religion, social status and all that.

144
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,700
These things are set up by a very small group that wants to keep mankind divided.

145
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,760
And they've been around since time immemorial.

146
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,500
Right.

147
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,000
And there's not enough people talking about that system.

148
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,380
But even if you talk about it, right, it's not going to change anything because it seems

149
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,740
like the majority wants it this way.

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,620
Look, look, I'll just shine my own shoes.

151
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,300
Right.

152
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,120
So wait a second.

153
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,660
You know, what do you mean by that?

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,540
Well, let's not use that analogy because that requires a story behind it.

155
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,260
But if you how would you put this?

156
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,080
This is a very complex thing to put in a thought and say it.

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,580
I know.

158
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,780
OK.

159
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,260
Hmm.

160
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,500
So complex, I can't even speak it.

161
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,220
Yeah.

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,780
All right.

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,260
Well, you can't look, look, look, take a moment, take a moment, because what you're trying

164
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,740
to get to here is, OK, we have the divide and conquer.

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
That is very useful.

166
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,640
That is something that is kept constant.

167
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,660
And so are the games one way or another.

168
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,020
Right.

169
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,620
Whether it's at the Circus Maximus or it's on the, you know, the maximum.

170
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,280
Yeah, I see where you go.

171
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,840
But we could hear there is something in the system, you know, like a while back, you know,

172
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,920
archaic brochures.

173
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,080
I don't endorse him, but he puts out some good stuff sometimes.

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,480
Right.

175
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,200
If not more than half the time, I should say.

176
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,960
He's big into the simulation, simulacrum, simulacra, whatever.

177
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,100
I've been bringing this up slowly for the past few years because there's no way that

178
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,480
things happen naturally as we're taught, right, because of the repeating on the cycle.

179
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,440
But there is a resistance within the construct, let's just call it, or the setting that we're

180
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,560
in, setting meaning physical and nonphysical.

181
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,280
Because when you do settings in theater or making film, it's the place and the time.

182
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,740
Right.

183
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,100
Right.

184
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,800
That's the setting.

185
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,900
So that's what I mean by the setting.

186
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,620
And if, for example, let's just say we did, I would consider past few Sonics on the banking

187
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,640
system to be a major expose.

188
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,700
Major.

189
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,120
Right.

190
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,600
So.

191
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,020
So when there is a secret.

192
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,920
And by the way, anyone can look up anything I said on that and you'll find it.

193
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,940
When there's a secret, how many people does it take to reveal it?

194
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Just one.

195
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,340
And then it should spread like wildfire, right?

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,679
And some people should do something about it.

197
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,240
These things, if someone that is not familiar with Greek speak, which I've given a papyri

198
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,460
little smatterings of that past few Sonics over the years, I think I got more intense

199
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,920
in the past couple of Sonics.

200
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,400
Yeah.

201
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,300
If someone that is not familiar with it at all and hears it, they should be really considering

202
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,840
what they're doing when it comes to quote unquote finance or finance or their money, quote unquote,

203
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,300
credit system, whatever.

204
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,920
But no one cares.

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,720
So is that care genuinely inherent in the human?

206
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,400
Like there are a bunch of clods that don't care and they're blunt.

207
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,660
Yeah, most of them are.

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,200
We said that.

209
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,560
But I mean, another example is like 9-11, right?

210
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,040
Dmitri Kaluzov did a benchmark expose.

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,080
This is nuclear.

212
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,560
Aha.

213
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,780
You don't believe it here.

214
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,720
I'll prove it to you.

215
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,980
And his proofs are way beyond what anyone would need to prove it legally and scientifically.

216
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,360
Where is the where's the public outcry?

217
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,000
How many people does it take?

218
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Right.

219
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,920
Well, here's the thing about that.

220
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,120
Right.

221
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,840
Look, I'm not trying to defend anybody.

222
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't get mad at me here.

223
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,820
OK, but here's the deal.

224
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,880
They hear this.

225
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,180
It concerns them.

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,740
They get upset.

227
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
They go, wait a minute.

228
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
This isn't the way it should be.

229
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
I don't want it this way.

230
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
They say that to themselves.

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Now they are in that mode.

232
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,440
They then go to deal with others who are.

233
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes.

234
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,460
But who are those others?

235
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,520
You see, why does it you see there's in other words, resistance is built into the setting.

236
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,580
Right.

237
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
But you built in.

238
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,760
It's like it's a wall of resistance.

239
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,520
It's like hitting a wall.

240
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,580
No, because look, I sit there and I go, look, this isn't the way it's supposed to work.

241
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,220
Now, I try and explain this to others.

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,960
I could try and do business with somebody else.

243
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,760
I try and make an exchange with somebody else and I try and explain, you know, this is the

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,580
way this ought to work.

245
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,560
I try and, you know, exchange a piece of information.

246
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,080
You realize this is actually what happened when you were concerned about this situation.

247
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,860
You hit enough resistance after a while.

248
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,060
It just kind of knocks the wind out of you.

249
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,680
Yeah, but it's it's specific to each person.

250
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,220
But if you average out this, how specific it is to everyone, there is a general resistance

251
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,180
across the board.

252
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,660
Right now.

253
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,640
Now, here's OK.

254
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,740
So let's say to who are going to end this subject.

255
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,620
So what happens is you realize, you know how they say, you know, be able to change the

256
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,140
things you can and accept or be able to do things you can't change, except the things

257
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,940
you cannot change.

258
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,700
The courage to change the things you can and the wisdom to know the difference.

259
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,940
Yeah.

260
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,380
OK, good.

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,620
Yeah.

262
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:08,800
So.

263
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,200
So now.

264
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,640
Yeah, right.

265
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,020
Exactly.

266
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,680
Know the difference.

267
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,020
So in this case, you take it.

268
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,380
So these things cannot change.

269
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,160
And then you must take it with stride, because if you see that it cannot change and you go

270
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,700
back and it's upsetting, well, then you're going to live a very upset life.

271
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:21,980
Right.

272
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,940
And I know what that's like, by the way, personally.

273
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,420
And but at the same time, you have to take it in stride.

274
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,720
Like Diogenes, he was an interesting philosopher, sage in ancient Greece.

275
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,720
Give you an example of how he took it in stride.

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,740
And this goes on the up and down.

277
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,700
He did many things.

278
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,020
But Alexander the Great came to him where he lived out in the forest.

279
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,260
And at the time, Diogenes was like sunning himself under a tree, you know, kind of off

280
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,900
to the side, you know, sunning himself and get some warmth.

281
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,560
And Alexander the Great comes to him and says, I hear you're one of the greatest sages.

282
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,060
That word of mouth has it.

283
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,600
You know, I've been to the academies and they all say that you're the one to talk to.

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
And since you are the way you are, I'm Alexander.

285
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,040
I can give you anything you want.

286
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
What is that?

287
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,360
You said, Alexander.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,300
Oh, if you give me anything I want, can you just move over a little to the left?

289
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,340
You're blocking the sun.

290
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,700
You see, just take it in stride like that, right?

291
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,980
I've seen a lot of stuff, not as much as some people, but more than most, let's say, from

292
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,040
basically the stuff that I've been around and been able to give an opportunity to see.

293
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,660
And I've been I've learned on my own to take it that way.

294
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,900
Been around very wealthy people, powerful people in the oil and gas and other things.

295
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,900
And I watched how they operate and I said, this is kind of like a TV show.

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
This isn't real.

297
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,760
Right.

298
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,400
Right.

299
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,100
So if it's not real, why would you throw your hat in the ring or your nuts in the grinder,

300
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,860
so to speak?

301
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,900
Right.

302
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,840
If it's not real.

303
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,960
Right.

304
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,060
So it's kind of funny.

305
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,640
But taking it in stride now, it's it's obviously the nervous reaction of being in a building

306
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,380
where a bomb is dropped on it and having your arm or your head blown off is very different

307
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,720
than what we're doing here, talking wherever we are.

308
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,640
Hopefully we're comfortable.

309
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,560
I know I'm fairly comfortable.

310
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,140
I hope you are.

311
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,020
I'm all right at the moment.

312
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,320
But there's people all any time and, you know, right, that are having a very hard time.

313
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,820
So that's just part of part of this existence.

314
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,440
But I would suggest taking it in stride is the way to go always.

315
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,420
And I know it's been said before, but the thing is, how do you do that?

316
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,600
And I would suggest that when you're not having a quote unquote good time physically or mentally,

317
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,080
pay attention and see how many voices are trying to catch up in your head.

318
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,620
And that would suggest a lot.

319
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,720
Right.

320
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,960
Very rarely does it get you to have that quiet inner peace when that happens.

321
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Right.

322
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,440
In other words, like your average NPC mainstreamer that watches Fox News, when he turns off the

323
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,320
TV, he still has it running in his head.

324
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,560
Right.

325
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,580
Those voices are still running in his head.

326
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:07,880
Sure.

327
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,160
Yeah.

328
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,580
Yeah.

329
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:09,860
So.

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,980
So one thing is to get that silence, which is, by the way, the easiest way to do it is

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,800
anticipate it.

332
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,640
So if you understand what we're saying here, which you've covered in previous sonics, is

333
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,280
that voice in your head is not you.

334
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,360
It sounds like you.

335
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,980
It's been going on for so long.

336
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,680
You're used to it.

337
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,300
Kind of like a pebble in your shoe that you don't take out.

338
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,420
And by the end of the day, you don't even know it's there anymore.

339
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,740
Right.

340
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,940
After a while, your foot gets numb, basically.

341
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah.

342
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,360
You become.

343
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
And also it's familiar.

344
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,880
So if you are aware that, wow, man, Greek talk about the voice, my head is not beat.

345
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,560
What is talking about?

346
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,240
It's always been there.

347
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,900
Yeah.

348
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,100
So here's proof that it's not you anticipate it.

349
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,080
Go ahead and let it fall.

350
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,040
Let it create a thought.

351
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,860
I've said this many, many times in these sonics.

352
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,620
When you hear it chattering away, whether it's slow chatter, good chatter, bad chatter,

353
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,160
go ahead, let it come to a pause or not.

354
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,920
And just in your mind, say, OK, what else do you have to say?

355
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,320
And watch what happens.

356
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,820
It goes totally silent because at that point, the gig is up.

357
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,720
It's like, oh, he actually he or she knows that it's not them and it's me, meaning another

358
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,740
entity doing it.

359
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,840
And now they're anticipating me.

360
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,560
I better stop.

361
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,080
Right, because I can't continue that way.

362
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,820
The only way these entities continue or this other whatever you want to call it continues

363
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,940
in your head is if you think that it's you.

364
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,960
It's kind of like someone shadowing you, you know, following your every move, which is a

365
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,340
typical thing in the military.

366
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,420
Right. Or when you're following someone, you just follow at a distance.

367
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,760
When they slow down, you slow down.

368
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,020
When they speed up, you speed up.

369
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,840
Right. I don't know what that's called.

370
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,380
I think it's a shadow kind of thing.

371
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,220
But that's how it works.

372
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,000
So if you can, yeah, if you can get it quiet and relaxed, then you'll get better.

373
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,900
At least you'll be in a situation where you can assess what's going on.

374
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,040
And by the way, if your arm gets blown off, you still have to wrap it tight, by the way.

375
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,960
What's left of it? You know, I'm not making fun of it, but that's really what it's called a

376
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,620
tourniquet. Right.

377
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,600
So absolutely true.

378
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,060
OK, well, and the funny thing is, if somebody's shadowing you and you turn in the same

379
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,540
direction that they are coming from and you go toward them, that's when the gig is up.

380
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,060
So, yeah, unless they're fast enough to turn and face away from you at the same time.

381
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,660
Right. Unless they are, which if they didn't anticipate your move, they won't be.

382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,300
So there you go.

383
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,520
That's how you disrupt that.

384
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,440
And because it's sonic, you know, your survival audio, your survival depends on audio.

385
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,480
A lot of people want to argue this point, but it's very simple.

386
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,620
When you're you rely on your vision, it's straight ahead and about 30 degrees to the

387
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,720
left, 30 degrees to the right from viable peripheral vision.

388
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,680
Some people more, some people a little less.

389
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,460
If you're in a dark place like in a forest, even see this memorialized in film or a dark

390
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
room or what do people say?

391
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh, did you hear that? We might be in trouble.

392
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,740
What is that? Right. It's your your sound basically is what is basically 360.

393
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,660
It's more direct.

394
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,359
Higher frequencies are more directional.

395
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,140
Lower frequencies are not directional.

396
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,260
So you do really rely on survival for audio and sound.

397
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,160
And by the way, poor sound quality reproduction will damage you as much as chemicals and

398
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,599
food do, by the way.

399
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,500
This is there's been studies on that.

400
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,120
They're not published, you know, so.

401
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,920
OK, well, fair enough.

402
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,940
But I find this interesting because, like I said, if you were to turn to somebody who's

403
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,000
shadowing you like that, though, and you turn exactly in their direction against the

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,560
direction that they were shadowing you, that's what it sounds like you're saying to do.

405
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,920
But would you just anticipate that?

406
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,660
Well, yeah. But should someone do that out loud with the whole OK, what else do you have

407
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,220
to say? You could, but it's not necessary.

408
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,300
I think it would be in a thought, see, because when you anticipate them, by the way, pay

409
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
attention to what's going on.

410
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,760
You don't hear your voice.

411
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,700
You don't hear any voices when you anticipate them.

412
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,540
You just tag that along at the end of the voices that you do hear.

413
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,240
No, you know, your own voice is totally emo.

414
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,240
It's totally silent.

415
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,020
Well, that's why you're reading emotion.

416
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,760
But that's why you end up speaking out loud when you're actually speaking, because you

417
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
don't have that sound in your head.

418
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,560
You actually have to make it right.

419
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,160
One of the some of the personal writings of Walter Russell, he would do it out loud when

420
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,660
he had thoughts that he didn't want to entertain or was in a tizzy or whatever.

421
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,480
He would go up to the get up from where he was sitting or in the room, go to the doorway

422
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,320
and say, get out and slam the door as a purely in gesture.

423
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,760
And he said that would change the feeling in him, in the room, whatever the environment.

424
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah. But but the emo, you're the interpersonal is silent and it's it's still a

425
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,600
language, just like, for example, Braille is by touch.

426
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:08,620
Right. Versus by sight, the inner voice that sound that sounds like you is foreign.

427
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,900
The inner voice that is you is completely silent.

428
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,380
There's no language attached to it.

429
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,860
Just Braille does not have a font.

430
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,400
Right. There's no font for Braille.

431
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
It's either a bump or it's not.

432
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,820
Right. Right.

433
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,780
So, yeah, so it's very much a simple way to deduce it.

434
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,600
It is an interesting way to think about it once you start reading the email, because

435
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,020
there's very small emotion, just like a flavor, a taste can take something that you

436
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,800
can taste just for a few seconds can can almost not even be described.

437
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,620
Like you could write a book, someone who's got a good sense of smell and taste on what

438
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,780
an apple tastes like.

439
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,040
Just one apple, not all the apples you can try.

440
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,660
Right. Because emo is the same way.

441
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,780
So a feeling cannot be right.

442
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,660
So it conveyed as easily as words and words are just condensed versions of emos and

443
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,020
thoughts and whatever you could put in a word.

444
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,860
Right. But the email part, once you start learning how to work that, then you start

445
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,680
seeing how the environment around you is more fluid than you normally would think it

446
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:23,260
is. Well, that that is definitely different, you know, than what I was thinking.

447
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,120
I want to go back to something, though, because you jumped off it a little quick for

448
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,880
me. You know, we were on the divide and conquer thing and the way that works and, you

449
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,940
know, how that's a useful tool for others.

450
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,400
You sort of suggested a solution, but I didn't quite get it.

451
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,660
Yeah, I don't.

452
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,480
Well, OK, there what is the solution is very simple.

453
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,800
It's just take it in stride because there's a built in resistance in the system.

454
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,660
In other words, if if what you know how they're dividing, right, what they're doing is

455
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,740
they're providing problems for the solutions.

456
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,500
Of course. Right. Right.

457
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,780
They create it's all problems, problems, problems.

458
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,160
And I wait a second. We were all just fine.

459
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,400
And here are all these problems and we already have the solutions.

460
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,300
But then it's like, no, that's not a solution.

461
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,480
Just look at the problem.

462
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,480
So, yeah, it's very simple.

463
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,960
Just take it in stride. People are the interesting thing about people is that make up the

464
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,520
collective. They're still individuals.

465
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,320
But are they really, if they all act very similarly within a general framework of

466
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,740
resisting what they're concerned about or what solution is not being presented, you

467
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,540
present the solution. No, it can't be that.

468
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,840
Right. I've brought up many things that you hear in Greek speak over the years, even two

469
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
decades ago to people that were actually fairly educated or whatever as well.

470
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
They say, oh, no, Greek.

471
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,680
I don't believe that's true because they would they would be public outrage.

472
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh, my gosh. You know, so they're right away.

473
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,480
They already have the plausibility because they're taking it in stride.

474
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,560
They're fine with it. Right.

475
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,380
You see, but that's the net you slam into is that a whole lot of people who don't even

476
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,860
question it. So they're taking it just fine in stride.

477
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,000
Whatever is put in place.

478
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,860
Exactly. So the most mainstream guy, even if he said a family sends all their children to

479
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,080
die in a war, that's OK.

480
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,200
We fought for our country.

481
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,460
They're still taking it in stride.

482
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,240
You'll have a few sad days or whatever, but they're so happy to get, you know, the flag

483
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
and the medal. Oh, we fought.

484
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, we're so proud. But I'm proud.

485
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,440
Yeah, that's it. I'm like, that's your OK.

486
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,500
That's your replacement for your flesh and blood.

487
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,180
It's gone that you spent years raising.

488
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,580
I don't. Yeah.

489
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,460
But here's the thing. I just view everyone as backdrop.

490
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Once you have an idea and you focus on it, everyone around you and everything, even the

491
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,280
thoughts are backdrop.

492
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,200
Right. That's how people focus on goals and get them done.

493
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,460
But on the other hand, I tell people don't set any goals because if you don't meet them,

494
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,660
there's no failure. Right.

495
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,680
If you don't have a goal, you're not going to be concerned about meeting it or failing to

496
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,960
meet it. Right. So keep the goal out of the way.

497
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,560
Keep the give and should factor really low, but keep the focus high.

498
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,860
You see, there's a difference like when you have a goal and you see yourself moving

499
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,040
towards it, whatever it is, whether it's physical or whatever, it could be anything.

500
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,020
The goal is to get something achieved.

501
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,140
Right. You have a paramount point in that goal.

502
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,100
You see yourself moving and then it doesn't work.

503
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,860
You get upset. If you're moving, you get really happy.

504
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,880
Why are you so happy? Because I'm moving towards my goal.

505
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh, why are you so upset? Because it's not going towards.

506
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,620
Forget about that. Right.

507
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,300
If you stay focused and leave the emotional part out completely, in other words, whether

508
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,120
you're achieving the goal or going away from it, there's no ups and downs emotionally.

509
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,780
You're just learning from it because actually, you know, you'll learn more from not

510
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,100
achieving your goal than achieving your goal.

511
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,800
Right. This has been shown as a hell scenario in Twilight Zones, where the bank

512
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,640
robber, you know, he thinks he's in heaven and he says, I want to go rob a bank.

513
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,620
And they say, OK, well, tell us how you want it to end.

514
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,160
Do you want to get away? Do you want to get caught?

515
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
He says, I don't want to.

516
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,480
I don't want to know that.

517
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,060
He says, just that's why I rob banks.

518
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,200
It's just, you know, the thrill is, no, you have to tell us.

519
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,440
Do you want to get caught? Or is this noise?

520
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,160
If this is heaven, I don't want to be here.

521
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,660
And he's like, what makes you think you're in heaven?

522
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,500
Yes. So that's the funny thing.

523
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,040
I remember that. That was the guy was gambling, too.

524
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,480
And he was and he couldn't move or something.

525
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,000
You know, he couldn't. He couldn't lose.

526
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,140
Yeah. And because he couldn't lose.

527
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,480
This sucks. What do you mean?

528
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,820
Well, how is this happening? This is no fun.

529
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,620
Right. And now is it really about winning or losing?

530
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,540
Is it about what you learn from losing?

531
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,580
There you go. The thrill is a different.

532
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,680
There's a thrill for winning and there's a thrill from not a thrill up, maybe a

533
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,700
thrill down, which is still look like drugs.

534
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,020
There's uppers and downers.

535
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,460
Right. They're both. Some people look at it as risk taking.

536
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,400
Right. Risk taking is the thing.

537
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,320
Right. If there is no failure, if there's no pain, if there's no possibility of

538
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,320
getting harmed, if there's no possibility of falling off of the beam, if there's

539
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,780
no possibility of hitting the floor off of the off of the high wire, then it's

540
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,100
not that interesting. Right.

541
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,680
Because there is there's no consequence.

542
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,360
So who cares? Right.

543
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,580
Well, here's the way like my what am I doing?

544
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,020
Like, what am I doing here? I said, OK, when it comes to other people.

545
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Yeah. Consider me like a pet.

546
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,740
I need some water and some food and some shelter.

547
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,720
I can do a lot of different things.

548
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,140
OK. But that's all I require.

549
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,300
Right. Right.

550
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,420
OK. Yeah.

551
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,180
If you if anyone wants a pet Greek, I'm available.

552
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,660
Pet Greek. OK.

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Well, I just need food and some water.

554
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,800
I could cook. I could do a lot.

555
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,580
I could fix pretty much anything mechanical and non-mechanical,

556
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,340
creative, inventive.

557
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,620
Yeah. And think about it.

558
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,960
Instead of saying, hey, I want to bank millions and billions like Jeff Bozo and

559
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,560
I want a fancy car and I want to own an island and I want my own lab and I want

560
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,260
to. Yeah, I'd like I'd like a lab with 150 feet of workspace, a counter space

561
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,960
and 200 feet of whiteboard.

562
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,600
That's usually blackboard, you know, right.

563
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,080
You know, and all this other stuff and all the machines and toys to make things

564
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,620
and a couple of associates that could, you know, you have someone in the

565
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,120
grinding department, actually the grinding department.

566
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,160
She better look. Anyway, the the other department, the machining department,

567
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,320
you know, all these other things, you need something made.

568
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Right. By the way, there's a big a lot of hoopla about all these automation

569
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,560
stuff, 3D printing that is so slow and sucky.

570
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Yeah, I could most of the time I could make stuff way faster and better than a

571
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,260
3D printer. But anyway, yeah, keep it simple.

572
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,400
So if your lot in life was to be a pet.

573
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,280
There was a song back in the days that we make great pets.

574
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,340
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,120
So you're not going to be upset.

576
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,840
Yeah. And by the way, I'm serious.

577
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,920
So if anyone's looking for a pet Greek, I'm pretty much available.

578
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,900
That is the strangest thing.

579
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,140
I would have never expected that to come out of your mouth.

580
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,220
No, it just did.

581
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Yeah, it did, though. It actually did.

582
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,600
So, all right.

583
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,280
All of this aside, I mean, we've been through the banking thing, but I see it

584
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,260
this way and still have this question, OK, which is, you know, if you learn this

585
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,260
and you say, OK, this is the way it actually runs and then you try and implement

586
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,860
that stuff. Yeah, it works well.

587
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,400
But here's the thing, does it?

588
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,760
Because. Yeah, yeah, it does.

589
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
Hold on. Hold on. They had to give you the remedy.

590
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,200
Doesn't mean you have to. They have to flaunt it before they went ahead and did

591
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,560
the system because they knew they were going to crash everything and make you

592
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,500
this is like make you part of the system, meaning literally you are the collateral.

593
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,060
Right. But you cannot really get out of that.

594
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,180
But you can get out of a lot of the stuff like when you do a conditional endorsement,

595
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,800
like a demand for lawful money, if you just sign something that requires signature.

596
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,340
Technically, they can't fractionalize that ten to one.

597
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,200
They just have to run it through as that amount.

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,480
There's someone that did a payroll check, received a payroll check

599
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,620
and the boss says, don't deposit the checks.

600
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,860
So whatever, because the money's not in there.

601
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,180
So he ran back to the bank after he deposited

602
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,000
and he asked for the check back because it was bouncing.

603
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,740
They did give it back to him and they had already cut off his endorsement.

604
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,740
So it wouldn't show.

605
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,320
So when they gave him back the check, they taped it back on.

606
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,940
So the thing is, it's out of your hands.

607
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,780
Right. At that point, you it also takes two for the endorsement to work.

608
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,640
Right. And here's the thing.

609
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,180
It all goes back to the who is running the information.

610
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,660
It's the Bar Association, which are which is a private association,

611
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,000
just like the banks that have been tasked.

612
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,220
Go look up history of the Department of Justice.

613
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,640
U.S. Even there'll be a whole bunch of articles.

614
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,940
It'll say, oh, it's around 18 something.

615
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,420
But, you know, it's a historical anomaly.

616
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,400
Grant signed it in like no one knows where it came from.

617
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,300
Duh. Right.

618
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,080
So, yeah, they are the problem for the gatekeeping aspect.

619
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,260
You know, there is codes, by the way.

620
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm not going on a tangent here. This is direct.

621
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,220
There are codes that tell you that there's nothing you can write.

622
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,100
Like if you have an exemption, right.

623
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,300
So there's nothing you can write that could be held against you

624
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,220
when it comes to banking.

625
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,480
So that means that you could take a napkin to write a hundred dollars,

626
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,160
sign it, and it's good as a check.

627
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,960
Just like that. No count. Nothing. Right.

628
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,820
But yet you go to a stove and it says the attorney general says

629
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,960
that check writers will be prosecuted.

630
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,040
Bullshit.

631
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,220
Because he says so. Yeah.

632
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,260
Because you actually give them the power to do that.

633
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,180
They don't know any law at all, by the way, at all.

634
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,900
They sound like they know.

635
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,400
There's like people all over the you know, I'm not going to mention names

636
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,820
like Cliff High or anyone like that.

637
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
But oh, OK.

638
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,180
But there's a lot of people that have followings

639
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,660
and they think they're learning from someone who sounds smart.

640
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,060
Big difference. Yes.

641
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,640
From someone who actually is smart.

642
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,620
Now, here's the thing.

643
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,720
That's one thing about a New York accent.

644
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
I always tell you, if you have a New York accent, take elocution,

645
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,300
because in most circles, English speaking,

646
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,800
if you show up with a New York accent, you talk like 30, 30, 30 like this.

647
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,600
You sound stupid.

648
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,760
It doesn't matter how smart you are.

649
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,100
Certain things are impedances.

650
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,660
Yes. Yes. Right.

651
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,780
Like very bad stuttering.

652
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,380
Right. Would be an impedance to communication.

653
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,560
A New York accent. Right.

654
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,780
A very heavy New York accent is an impedance to communication.

655
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,040
But then you have other impedances to communication,

656
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,040
like people who sound smart that draw in a certain attention.

657
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,820
But actually what they're saying is pretty much worthless.

658
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,900
Yeah. Right.

659
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,800
So you have to is all this stuff to be considered back to the banking system.

660
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,600
You can only do your part when a remedy is offered.

661
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,320
You do what you you do your part.

662
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,860
But usually these remedies require them to do their part also.

663
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,720
Right. It's a pairing.

664
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,820
Right. You show that's why the whole thing works.

665
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,260
If you have good record keeping.

666
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,200
So, you know, it takes a little extra work.

667
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,940
But the problem is they set up everyone with programming and conditioning.

668
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,220
I hope anyone who's interested in the subject goes and listens

669
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,520
to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act by David Merrill YouTube.

670
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,000
Right. Yeah. You got to listen to that.

671
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,300
And it's very dry.

672
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,260
But he's correct on everything there, which I endorse that video, by the way.

673
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,980
In other words, everything he's he says on that video is rock solid.

674
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,580
And every every way.

675
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,260
OK, that's why it's it's a really good 30 minute or whatever

676
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,500
is 20, whatever minute education.

677
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,060
And this works in every country, except for certain countries

678
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,900
where they don't consider that they have a citizenship, that they have subjects.

679
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,880
Right. OK. Yeah. Right.

680
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,880
But it's still different.

681
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,260
But it still works because you will find

682
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,940
even in the UK and I know any of the UK or Great Britain,

683
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,860
Canada, Australia, all that, you know, they say they're independent, whatever.

684
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,940
They do have a statute saying that you cannot restrict someone

685
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,860
from doing a restricted endorsement.

686
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,840
Right. So. Oh, fair enough.
