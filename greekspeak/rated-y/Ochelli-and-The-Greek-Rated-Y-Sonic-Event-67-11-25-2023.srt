1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,860
Rated Y 67.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,980
Here we go.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,820
And there's a lot to there's a lot happening in the world.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,180
I always I think, but you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, I know you're not keeping track

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,200
of the news or anything.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,460
What are they, what are they on to hostage exchanges now, stuff like this?

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,020
Yeah.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,720
Yeah.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,380
You know, and it's becoming more and more divisive.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,840
I note that as we go into the next phase, because I know we're about, I don't see that

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,220
at all.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,100
Let me interrupt for a moment, because as long as people, okay, you've got firemen that

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,040
drive around in big red fire trucks, right?

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm not trying to make any ensuing anything here other than, you know, there's fire departments

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,640
that have heavy equipment to extinguish fires on structures, buildings and cities and towns

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,020
and whatever.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,740
Okay.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,260
And then you have toys that children want to acquire, whether, you know, whatever desire

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,100
they have, they don't put out fires and do anything like that.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,360
Right.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,740
Right.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,300
But they want the same stuff.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,580
Right.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,680
So if you see people in a society that takes sports seriously, they buy the paraphernalia,

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,460
they take time off, they watch, you know, they make a big deal, right?

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,080
They pay two, three, four hundred dollars, three thousand dollars for special seats in

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,700
stadiums.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,920
Right.

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,660
All that.

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:29,940
Okay.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,840
That's the toy.

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,180
Right.

34
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,880
So the toy doesn't really put out fires.

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,220
Right.

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,220
So now it's false.

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,460
Tribalism is all it is.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,500
I mean, because, yeah, we think it's real sports in action, but you ever listen to these

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,720
guys.

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,020
We we won today.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,100
You didn't win.

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
You watched a game on TV.

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,160
You know.

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah.

46
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,560
That's people.

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,380
There's something wrong with me because people ask me to watch sports and all I can see is

48
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,360
people in uniforms chasing a ball.

49
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,200
I don't see any.

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:01:59,620
Right.

51
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,020
Okay.

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,020
So in essence, you have the people that desire the sports, which is the child with the toy

53
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,580
fire truck.

54
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,900
And then you actually have a fire department with a big fire truck that puts out fires.

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,320
Right.

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
That's all war is.

57
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,580
So the problem is this.

58
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,580
When people get away from the competitive sports, they will view the wars for what they are.

59
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,760
And they, too, will go away.

60
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,100
It's a it's it's just a parallel.

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,000
These wars are not really wars.

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,520
They're not.

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,820
It's a sport.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,380
That's why the terminology, the technical terminology is put this way.

65
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,620
The legitimately accepted technical terminology is war is what a theater.

66
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,540
Right.

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,040
Yeah.

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,380
So the same thing.

69
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,920
So as long as people are the way they are and the culture is the way that it is, you

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,300
have it.

71
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,900
I have no problem with it.

72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,160
I just don't want to be a part of it.

73
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,800
It does affect everyone, of course, but so do sports and so do holidays.

74
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:53,800
Right.

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Like, for example, why I want to go downtown on December 25th and file a document down

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,000
in the county.

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,320
Right.

78
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,060
Oh, yeah.

79
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,640
And I go down there to file a document, important document on December 25th.

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,000
Then what?

81
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,580
They're what?

82
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,080
Closed.

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,620
Why?

84
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Your religious attributes, your religious observances are disturbing my ability to do

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
commercial my commercial affairs.

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,540
Yes.

87
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,680
Right.

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,140
Right.

89
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,580
But they say that they don't have any religious observances.

90
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,860
So what's going on?

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,240
It's well, it's a commercial.

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,000
See, to me, it's a commercial arrangement.

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,940
It's not about, you know, it was allegedly created out of the religion, but it's about

94
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,200
commercial arrangements anyway.

95
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,320
So, of course, it's going to disrupt other commercial arrangements, is it not?

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,580
Yeah.

97
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,120
But they tell you on one side that it's not.

98
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,180
See, so the whole thing is just set up the way that it's set up to confuse and whatever.

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,120
But it's all very simple when you when you see through the confusion.

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,500
Right.

101
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,560
Yeah.

102
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,900
So it's all the same.

103
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,240
It's all the same stuff.

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,480
Well, you know, they give you Santa Claus, right, which I used to love our discussions

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,440
on Santa Claus, which are absolutely horrendous.

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,920
It's a symbol.

107
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,460
Yeah.

108
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,040
It's a symbol.

109
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,300
It could go either way.

110
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,560
Right.

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,960
Well, it's a symbol, but it has a basis.

112
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,360
There's a reason why a glowing red thing has screaming children put on its lap.

113
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,779
I mean, that's right.

114
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,000
Wish of prosperity.

115
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
Same with the birthday cake.

116
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:18,980
Right.

117
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,880
You make a wish of prosperity that that's what they call Bronze Age stuff.

118
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,280
You know, the human sacrifice.

119
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,560
So it's a holdover, right, from that society and from other worlds also.

120
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:31,940
Right.

121
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,080
You can see there's a time when it goes away because, for example, in the U.S., let's say

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,560
we're talking about what they call Christmas.

123
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,480
It was illegal and it was made legal, illegal, meaning in the sense that it was not accepted

124
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
and viewed to be unlawful.

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,760
And New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, right.

126
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,700
They brought it back.

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,940
Right.

128
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,080
In the 1800s.

129
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,440
Right.

130
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,460
So Dickens.

131
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,980
By the way, all these popular writers that they tell you to read, Twain, Dickens or whatever.

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
They suck.

133
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,040
Have you read Dickens or Twain?

134
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,660
They can't write for shit.

135
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,420
Well, Dickens bores me to death.

136
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,820
I kind of like Twain a little bit, you know, because you can get into the story, kind of

137
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,500
draws pictures.

138
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
But it's poorly written.

139
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,960
I can't stay with it.

140
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,100
Even Melville.

141
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,420
Right.

142
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,120
And Emerson.

143
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,400
There's not very good.

144
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,440
Emerson's better.

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,760
But but here's the thing.

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,900
Just like now they put out trash.

147
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,140
Right.

148
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,420
This was the trash that was put out then before the, quote, unquote, reset.

149
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:31,960
Right.

150
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,020
Well, Steinbeck put me to sleep, too.

151
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,640
I could not get Steinbeck in, you know, in those.

152
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
It's not very good.

153
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,220
The class, what they call it now.

154
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,000
I was having a conversation with someone engineering type recently, and I said, look, if I were

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,560
to be in a deserted, if you were to be on a deserted island, what would you bring?

156
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,120
One book?

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,680
What would it be?

158
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,360
Or one author?

159
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,060
And he didn't have an answer.

160
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,100
My answer was Shakespeare.

161
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Easy, easy.

162
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,720
Try to read Shakespeare.

163
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,060
It is so dense.

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Yeah, it is.

165
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,280
And and is refined at the same time.

166
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,740
Yeah.

167
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,200
Right.

168
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,440
I'll make you think.

169
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,940
Most people say, wait a second.

170
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,740
I know what they I know what the Greeks are going to say.

171
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,180
The Bible.

172
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,500
Right.

173
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,140
No, no.

174
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,780
Sorry, guys.

175
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,140
Wouldn't bring that.

176
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,040
I would bring Shakespeare for sure.

177
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,700
You being that English is my primary language.

178
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,060
Right.

179
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,440
Right.

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,840
OK, well, it makes some sense.

181
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,100
Yeah.

182
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,880
You know, the Bible is something that you should be.

183
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,420
You should acquire the knowledge therein.

184
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,560
You should acquire the history therein.

185
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,600
And then you also have to understand where you are in time and what they've done to it

186
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,900
or what they want you to see.

187
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,300
Why are they allowing you to see that?

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,620
And how has it been changed?

189
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,680
Right.

190
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,400
So.

191
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,160
Well, there was a point in time where the majority of the population really didn't seem

192
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,320
to know how to read anyway.

193
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,500
And it used to get read to them.

194
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Right.

195
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,340
I mean, that practice is still kind of in play because you go to these churches, right?

196
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,880
These circuses, these theaters, all of them, all those words apply.

197
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,700
And a guy gets up there and usually picks a passage.

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,100
Right.

199
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,580
You know something.

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,160
And that's always driven me crazy, too, about people that that like will insist upon reading

201
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,780
from the Bible on a daily.

202
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,820
And they get nothing out of it.

203
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,920
They get nothing out of it.

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,060
It's the weirdest thing.

205
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,580
It's like I've never seen dedication to a book where you get zero out of it.

206
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,940
Yeah.

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,140
That literary method.

208
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,560
Try it with any book.

209
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,380
It won't work.

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,860
You won't get anything out of it.

211
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,840
It's not it's not it wasn't set up to be written that way.

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,140
And it wasn't set up to be written by chapter and verse, you know, no matter what is said

213
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,620
about it.

214
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,880
Because here's one interesting thing in the latter days that there will be people scoffing

215
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,220
at it.

216
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Right.

217
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,300
There's a lot more scoffing at the Bible.

218
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,880
If you go on YouTube, maybe it's because of conversations and things that I have, you know,

219
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,380
they select what they should show you.

220
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,820
If I open a YouTube homepage, half of it is Bible commentary on how, you know, the Bible

221
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,800
is fake or this, you know, this, that and the other, you know, negative, you know, or

222
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,280
contrary.

223
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,660
Right.

224
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,600
And then there's a whole portion that is pro these Christian stuff because they don't know

225
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,180
what to show.

226
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,260
We'll just throw this stuff at the Greek because they I've had conversations on the on the

227
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,940
phone and I've cleaned everything off the computer.

228
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,600
Right.

229
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
By the way, clean MGR.

230
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,320
If you have Windows, go down to your taskbar and type in run.

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,640
And when it comes up, you in the run box, I'll run as an RUN.

232
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,120
Type in clean MGR, just C-L-E-A-N-M-G-R, enter.

233
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,140
Select all the boxes on the left, hit OK, and it's going to ask you, do you want to

234
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,400
delete everything you selected?

235
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,080
Yes.

236
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,520
That does the same thing as all those other virus things that they want you antivirus

237
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,960
clean up hardware stuff, programs to install.

238
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,540
Right.

239
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,420
That's that's how you do it without downloading, you know, a program that's going to want to

240
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,860
take as much information from you as possible and stick a whole bunch of secret programs

241
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,920
on you to write.

242
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,820
The weird thing about that, though, is for me, I got to tell you, no matter what I do,

243
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Google gets my conversations.

244
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,760
Yes.

245
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,040
So anyway, I did this and then freshed up the computer and I go back to like a YouTube

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,680
or whatever news homepage and it actually starts referring things that I had in conversations

247
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,780
an hour or two, three, four or a day before.

248
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Right.

249
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,740
Interesting.

250
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,320
Right.

251
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,800
Right.

252
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,780
And I've done experiments with this.

253
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,140
And I said, look, I'd call someone and say, listen, this has nothing to do what we're

254
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,660
talking about.

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,520
Do you have you ever restored an old teddy bear?

256
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,260
Do you collect teddy bears?

257
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,220
You know, teddy bears.

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
Have you ever fixed a teddy bear?

259
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,820
And where do you get high quality teddy bears?

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,100
Right.

261
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,520
Yeah.

262
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,280
OK, that's it.

263
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,160
And then I clean up the computer where I open up, let's say, YouTube homepage and guess

264
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,220
what videos are there?

265
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,300
Teddy bears.

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Antique teddy bear.

267
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,740
Yeah.

268
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,460
No.

269
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,100
Look, the weirdest thing is I've sat in my room, you know, because I have a little office.

270
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,760
But even when I rented a room from somebody, the same thing happened.

271
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,080
And I'm staying in different places.

272
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,420
We would have conversations, just two guys or three guys having a conversation.

273
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,320
And whatever we were talking about would be the thing that they would show up to me on

274
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Google, on YouTube.

275
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,260
You go to a Web site where it picks up the ads.

276
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,760
The ads are for this stuff.

277
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,380
It was hilarious.

278
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,620
It was like, you know, I like two or three guys get to talk and they start talking about

279
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:26,900
women.

280
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,180
Right.

281
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,940
This kind of thing would happen.

282
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,460
So we have one of these kind of, you know, salacious conversations, whatever is guy

283
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:32,800
talk.

284
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,540
OK.

285
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,840
Normal stuff, I think.

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,180
Anyway, I go to my computer and what am I getting?

287
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,060
I got, you know, would you like to meet Russian women?

288
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Would you like to meet these kind of women?

289
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,580
Do you want a porno site?

290
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,620
Do you want to? I mean, all kinds of crazy stuff.

291
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,900
I go on YouTube and it's like the pickup artist book.

292
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,620
Audiobook is, you know, by the way, I would interject if I was there instead of talking

293
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,380
about women. I said, you guys know how to talk to women or with women.

294
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,300
Big difference. Right.

295
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,440
Of course. But we were objectifying them, you know, typical lowbrow stuff.

296
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,020
All right. So, yeah, well, it's not typical for me.

297
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,640
I cut that stuff short real quick.

298
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,720
But go ahead. OK.

299
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,940
Again, I'm a different I'm just accommodating who was around me.

300
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,700
But I mean, the weirdest thing was that Google wants to sell me, you know, Russian

301
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,760
brides and important to the Russian brides want to be sold.

302
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,500
Is it voluntary? Is it by consent?

303
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,580
It looks like it. I mean, it looks like it may not be, though.

304
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,300
That's true. By the way, there's a bunch of people.

305
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,640
The alternative is 2013.

306
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,460
I forgot her name. Came out with a bunch of stuff about bafflement and all that.

307
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,640
And she uncovered and showed how YouTube videos are have codes for finding children

308
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,540
for sale, human trafficking.

309
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,880
And then she said she's not suicidal.

310
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,060
And a week later, they found her hung in her garage.

311
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,460
And then her boyfriend died a couple of weeks after that.

312
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,380
Oh, you're talking about the D.C.

313
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
Madam. No, I think it's Tracy Twyman.

314
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Oh, yeah. Tracy, did she die?

315
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,100
Yeah, they found her hanging.

316
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,100
By the way, there's that sound again, people.

317
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,920
It sounds like a dog with a, you know, dog is a collar with the plates on it.

318
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,420
The name tags. That's what it sounds like.

319
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,080
Moving around or a dog tag.

320
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,020
That's what it sounds like. You have interference.

321
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,200
So, by the way, guys, we before we started recording.

322
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,240
Yeah, we're trying to find this noise.

323
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
And Chuck always called it scratching.

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
I was wondering how am I so much, you know, wondering.

325
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
So then we started.

326
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,600
Neither of us knew that this dog tag sound started coming on.

327
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,040
So if you hear that, it's a technical thing we'll work out.

328
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,200
But I think it's not so anomalous to mention it.

329
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,900
But Tracy Twyman, she brought out some stuff.

330
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,320
And when the moment she got involved with a group that was showing how

331
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,120
YouTube codes videos for human trafficking.

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,940
She's hanging in her in the garage.

333
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,800
Right. Right.

334
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,760
So, well, that's serious.

335
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,380
That is what happens when you touch on the serious thing.

336
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,340
And you actually get it, something that's workable.

337
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,820
I mean, whether you're Gary Webb or whoever.

338
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,280
The DC madam is an example of that, though, by the way.

339
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they have.

340
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,140
Yeah, she was very adamant about says, I'm afraid for my life.

341
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm not suicidal.

342
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,960
So in case I write, you find me, you know, right.

343
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,020
And what happens is they say she commits suicide.

344
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,120
What is what does the public do? Where's the outrage?

345
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,900
No. Did it like, you know, a thousand people, 10,000, a half hundred thousand,

346
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,580
half a million people must have heard her say she's not suicidal.

347
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,820
Right. Right.

348
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,040
And she feels her life might be threatened.

349
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,140
And then they say they find her hanging in a shed or something. Right.

350
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah. I'm taking a look at this.

351
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,500
She died in 2019. I didn't even know. Yeah.

352
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,100
Yeah. I was aware. Where's the same with this one?

353
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,220
Where's the outrage?

354
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,060
Yeah. Nobody cares.

355
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,740
Well, you know. Yeah.

356
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,420
No, there was no outrage about a matter of fact,

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,460
she was real popular in the alternative media.

358
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,700
I remember she was on like everybody's show.

359
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,300
I mean, the big ones, the small ones, everything

360
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,780
about the Merovingian stuff about.

361
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,380
Now you sound like women talk, the big ones and the small.

362
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,220
Anyway, here we go again.

363
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,400
Anyway, I'm just saying I remember there was just a bunch of stuff there

364
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,100
and I see some Reddit threads about her and things like that.

365
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,340
But I mean, I just did.

366
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,680
I didn't even realize she died.

367
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,380
I just thought she was one of these people that disappeared because she disappeared.

368
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,880
All right. Well, but see, but that happens

369
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,200
to where they disappear for a while and then they come back.

370
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,480
But what's very strange to me is that she was pretty young.

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,980
Looks like I believe I might have.

372
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,800
I believe that might relate to what to the Greeks, too.

373
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,120
Slightly. But yeah.

374
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,420
So anyway, where we're on people, you know, I say,

375
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,460
are these guys entertaining a tangent or is this conversation going somewhere else?

376
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,780
The idea here, Chuck, is very simple, is that again, where's the outrage?

377
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,740
Right. Where's the outrage? Where's the outrage?

378
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,320
And every time I say, where's the outrage is for a completely different topic.

379
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
Right. Where is he?

380
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,960
Look, you go into a store and they sell this is organic food and this isn't.

381
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,160
Where's the outrage? Why?

382
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,500
So what's the difference?

383
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,460
Well, one has poisons and toxins and pesticides.

384
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,000
The other one does. Where's the outrage?

385
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,580
Well, why don't we stop?

386
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,240
Why don't we go get the people who are putting poison, right, and stop it?

387
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,040
So it's all organic.

388
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,040
We don't have to have a separate organic category.

389
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,100
You see how screwed up that is.

390
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,960
I ask this question all the time and people get pissed off at me.

391
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,280
I go, look, you see, you go into a food store and you see there's this little tiny

392
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,820
section they call health food, right?

393
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,920
So if that's the healthy food, what is the rest of this crap?

394
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,260
And they're telling you that there's only this little section of health food.

395
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,380
Right. And I'm not even saying that that's really health food.

396
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,180
But isn't that weird? Nobody says anything.

397
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,620
People who are not committing outrage

398
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,300
for showing outrage for sports and war, organic and non-organic food.

399
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,820
People saying they're not suicidal and then being suicided

400
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,240
don't deserve any more than what they have.

401
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,280
I think they have more than they deserve right now.

402
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,160
What I'm trying to say is very simple, is there's no there.

403
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,440
What am I trying to say? That's very simple.

404
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,840
I don't know. We deserve to be pranked by Santa Claus.

405
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,540
Those of us that are, you know, it's not it's not very good.

406
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,220
It's in other words, it's an example for a very few that are passing through here

407
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,360
to see. Don't try to change it.

408
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,900
You can't change it. But if there's outrage or whatever, again, those right.

409
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,920
It'll be shown very quickly that the ones that are outraged are crazy.

410
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Right. So you're never going to get a majority,

411
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,720
at least in the ever that we have to change things more in the right way.

412
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,100
This is not the type of place that it is.

413
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Right. Well, people do get outraged, but it's always about dumb things.

414
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,260
It's fake outrage. Yeah, it's like misdirected.

415
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,380
They're they're not really angry at the stuff that's really stepping on them,

416
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,040
but they pick a new savior.

417
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,920
See, I was going to ask you about that.

418
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,420
And hold on. They don't.

419
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,100
Nobody picks. Nobody does anything.

420
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,360
Like, for example, whenever there is a movement, even the 60s, that's artificial.

421
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,280
All of those protests and stuff is artificial.

422
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,800
One hundred percent. All of them.

423
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,640
Well, let's say ninety nine percent artificial.

424
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,100
In other words, they're funded by the same people that have created the problem.

425
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,200
That's why I could George Carlin say, if you think you have a solution,

426
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,599
you're part of the problem because this place doesn't need a solution.

427
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,200
This is the way it was made to be.

428
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,119
What I mean to say is, though, is I've been inundated lately again

429
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,900
with, you know, people saying that, you know, Trump is going to be the guy

430
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,300
is going to come back and set everything right, you know, again.

431
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,599
And I say to myself, well, what what is this investment?

432
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,000
This is where they're focusing.

433
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,160
Their outrage is.

434
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,940
Yeah, but hold on. Very simple.

435
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,140
Anything political?

436
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,420
Are they coming out and telling you, sorry, guys, we did some bad dealings

437
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,260
in the 1930s and we had to put up your country as collateral

438
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,880
to a private, non-surface banking cartel?

439
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,180
Gangsters, everybody.

440
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,740
OK, no receivership.

441
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,200
You kidding?

442
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,100
Well, then you're part of then they're part of the problem.

443
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,940
Right. But it's not a problem.

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
You see. Right.

445
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
So because this is the way the place is made.

446
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,900
This is the way it's supposed to be. OK.

447
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,360
Yeah. Until. OK.

448
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,700
You've got an amusement park.

449
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,480
It's got all the different rides, the fun house, the scary house, the roller

450
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,640
coast. You can't go.

451
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,680
You can go in there and modify them slightly and put new ones.

452
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,520
Take out. Right.

453
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
But the theme has to stay the same.

454
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,140
But if you come in and tear the whole place down.

455
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
Right. So the whole thing has to be torn down.

456
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,860
OK. With health, you're saying this.

457
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,080
It's not possible.

458
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,400
Here's the thing. The liver in the body loves coffee.

459
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,540
You could soak the liver in coffee.

460
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,060
It's it's in heaven.

461
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,860
It actually gets high off of it.

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,040
But it hurts the kidneys.

463
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,140
It can't hurt the kidneys. Right.

464
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,260
On and on and on. Things that help the skin hurt the liver.

465
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,040
Sure. Right. Things that help the lungs.

466
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,120
Right. Hurt the muscle tissue.

467
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,900
Right. So there's nothing that's healthy or is there a more healthy, quote

468
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,480
unquote, regimens? And we've gone over those, by the way, eating seasonally,

469
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,000
eating minimally and understanding based on energies, stuff that builds

470
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,360
muscles and weakens bones.

471
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,500
You know, it's just one way or another. Right.

472
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,940
I mean, there is no health food.

473
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,680
There is nothing healthy. You must understand.

474
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,560
Like, for example, when I put out, by the way, I want to thank the people for

475
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,120
is still frequently get for the one one recipe that I went to

476
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,660
and O.N.G. with you in depth.

477
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,360
So we've never gone into cooking in depth.

478
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,820
But that one episode we did on how to do brown rice, number seven or brown rice,

479
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,300
number eight, depending if you use an umeboshi plum or not.

480
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,780
I'm still getting feedback on it.

481
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,900
And it's always like beyond what.

482
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,320
And it's never it tastes good.

483
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,460
It's not about taste.

484
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,160
And one of the comments that I got, someone wanted to add garlic or something

485
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,980
to it. No, it's not about flavor.

486
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,940
It's about matching these things purely based on energy.

487
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,600
And when you put together a meal based on energy,

488
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,580
not what you flavor, you desire,

489
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,340
you will have this outcome and learn how to do that. Right.

490
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,880
By the way, most traditional cultural food was based on energy combination.

491
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,380
Right. Unless you get really crazy like like like pomfret,

492
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,540
pomfret, which is French fries.

493
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,460
Yes. And steaks, you know, steak for it.

494
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,220
You know, the best steak sauce when you have the French fries

495
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,580
and steak is like it's like a liquid pate.

496
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,600
It's butter, wine, garlic and pureed chicken liver

497
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,200
as in the sauce for your steak.

498
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,300
I mean, oh, my gosh.

499
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,880
You know, it's huge, right?

500
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
Amount of stuff.

501
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,940
Yeah, that has an energetic counterpart to it as well.

502
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,440
That's what I wanted to ask you about that, actually, because, look,

503
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,580
flavor in and of itself, can't that create an energetic result?

504
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,900
If you secondary, it's secondary.

505
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,440
But I mean, there's like a heavenly flavor in your mouth.

506
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,820
Even they tell you when you eat chocolate and stuff like that,

507
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,060
it does this or that to your brain when you eat certain foods.

508
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,020
If they're pleasurable to you.

509
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah. Well, OK, so sweet would be for the spleen and the pancreas.

510
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,600
Stimulation. Right. Taste.

511
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,000
The bitter would be stimulation for the liver.

512
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,840
Right. On and on and on.

513
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,880
Right. Then you have tastes in between.

514
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,300
Well, what's really good for the brain, you know, because this is the thing

515
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,160
no food at all, actually, is best for the brain.

516
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,940
Because I was, you know, I was told, you know, like fatty stuff

517
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,740
because the brain is kind of like of a fatty material.

518
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,720
Well, that's another thing. The lipids and all that. Yes.

519
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,820
But but to a certain degree, water.

520
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,980
Look, OK, you know, this is, again, several conversations.

521
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,220
You know how there's side effects for drugs, right?

522
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,920
And there's also they all have psychological effects also.

523
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,280
But they don't state that, right?

524
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,980
Especially with young people.

525
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,640
I used to do this.

526
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,580
So when a child gets whatever, you know, unruly or whatever, OK, fine.

527
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,200
So call me over.

528
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,000
I want to come over and speak to the child before mealtime,

529
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,520
like a half hour before. OK.

530
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
So I come and speak to the child a half hour before

531
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
and I have them write their name and five or six years old.

532
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,560
You know, they they start to, you know, how they write, right?

533
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,920
Basically, you can do this with an adult.

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,160
Sign your name, write your name.

535
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,920
Then go ahead and have your favorite food.

536
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,900
What's your favorite food? What would you desire?

537
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,480
Child was chocolate milk, chocolate milk and something else.

538
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,620
I don't recall. It wasn't savory.

539
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,900
But anyway, after they had that, waited 10 minutes, write your name.

540
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,600
And oh, my gosh, the T didn't look like a T.

541
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,100
It looked like an A without the center part. OK, right.

542
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,860
And it was like, oh, my gosh, so distorted.

543
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,440
The same with adults. Write your name, sign your name.

544
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,940
However, have your favorite food or what you're even just a normal meal

545
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,980
that you normally eat without being, you know, conscientious about it.

546
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,500
Remember your name after the meal.

547
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,360
I had one adult once say, I can't even write.

548
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,760
I can't write.

549
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,140
It's like, what do you mean you can't write?

550
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,560
Of course you can write. Just drag the pen.

551
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,580
Just if you can't write, just drag the pen.

552
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,900
I mean, it's the best you can do.

553
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,420
And that's all they could do is just drew basically a crooked line.

554
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,180
They couldn't even sign their name and adult. Right.

555
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,060
So, OK, so everything has an effect on the brain.

556
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,980
What will happen is if let's say you have, quote unquote, healthy food

557
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,060
after you write your name, after you write your name,

558
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
when you're comparing before and after.

559
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,400
Yeah. Even with the healthy food, you will notice a drastic change.

560
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,280
There will be a change if it's a sweet food or a savory food in one direction.

561
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,560
Right. And it also the way you write your name, the distortion

562
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,300
in it conforms to what you've eaten as well.

563
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,820
So, OK, there is no no.

564
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,920
Look, if we were meant to be healthy, we wouldn't have to eat.

565
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,260
And yes, does he mean does the Greeks say we should be breatharians?

566
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,560
Yeah. But not the way breatharianism is discussed.

567
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
We would not eat need to eat.

568
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,340
We gather most of our energy from the environment anyway.

569
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,980
That's why when you go out in the summer, you don't have you notice in the hot

570
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,500
summer days, you don't you don't eat much.

571
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,080
And yet you have the same amount of energy.

572
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
We're in the winter. You need to eat more.

573
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,720
By the way, speaking of energies, I've also been getting messages

574
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,020
about health things and a few concerns like, are you sick?

575
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,380
No, no, I'm not. I'm just dealing with a couple of things.

576
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,820
You know, I mean, my I'm going to be 60 pretty soon.

577
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,760
So which amazes most people because they say I don't sound that old.

578
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,540
But either way, so we don't.

579
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,540
Yeah, I'm just going through some stuff, nothing too serious.

580
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,380
But here's some concerned emails.

581
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
And when I get more than two or so, I'll bring it up.

582
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,760
And what I've noticed is the environment is being stressed.

583
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,120
Before we started recording, I said I want to talk about how we're being stressed.

584
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,000
What I mean about that is I live in the southwest, Tucson, Arizona.

585
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,280
And after monsoon season, which is late summer rains, usually you've got to go out

586
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,700
and get the weed whacker if you live on a property and got to cut the grass

587
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,720
because it grows really seriously fast and tall.

588
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,900
And yeah, it looks pretty wild.

589
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,660
The place looks wild.

590
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,620
Well, this year after the monsoons, I keep saying, you know, there's no

591
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,040
we don't have to cut any grass, nothing's growing, nothing's growing. Right.

592
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,540
What happened?

593
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,280
This is the first year that I've noticed this.

594
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,840
I've been here since 1990, what they call 1998.

595
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,220
And I've never seen this before.

596
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,540
Right.

597
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,620
Well, see, now you don't have to cut the grass.

598
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,460
Now, I see that in the southeast all the time since I've moved here.

599
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,020
I see it all the time.

600
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,860
There's a certain time.

601
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,980
No, no. I'm talking about this year.

602
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,120
There's a stress level.

603
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,980
OK, that's happening in nature.

604
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,140
If you don't cut the grass after monsoon season, it grows up to about knee

605
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,440
or waist height and it turns brown and falls over and it makes a mess. Right.

606
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,160
Right. So in some some neighborhoods, they write you a fine and all that.

607
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,680
And I'm prepared here to cut the grass after monsoon season.

608
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,160
Actually, even before monsoon season is over, you cut it for every week.

609
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,960
Otherwise it gets out of control. Right.

610
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,820
Right. Nothing, nothing at all this year has grown.

611
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,720
The garden has done well because I have the scale rate or the water treatment.

612
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,240
Right. It's garden has grown stupendously.

613
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,320
And anything that you run through this device grows really well.

614
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,800
You know, we've had like a

615
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,480
sweet potato plant produce over eight pounds of delicious sweet potatoes,

616
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,440
which is unusual. It's way above average, almost double the average.

617
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,500
And so one plant, one plant produced eight pounds of sweet potatoes.

618
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,860
Yes. A basketball. I want one plant. Yeah.

619
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,840
So so imagine you had a farm like with a thousand plants.

620
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,440
You'd have quite a, you know. Yeah, that's quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah.

621
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,500
So it would probably do even better.

622
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,920
But here's the point.

623
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,200
Why isn't the grass growing?

624
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,520
Let's just say let's set a timer.

625
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,200
This is the end of November 2023.

626
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,660
And I'm still waiting.

627
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,540
It's like the weed whacker is ready to go.

628
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,960
It's the trim line is wound up.

629
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,380
I've got a cordless one.

630
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,280
I've got a corded one.

631
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,500
No weed whacking. Oh, I'm so happy.

632
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,940
I hate because it's a pain in the butt, right?

633
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,980
To cut all this grass everywhere on the property.

634
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,260
But there's nothing growing.

635
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,420
Well, what kind of a stress?

636
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,500
I've had a mesquite tree die, started dying last year, which is unusual

637
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,840
because this is a desert, a very hardy tree.

638
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,720
It's a hardwood tree.

639
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,400
Mesquite, right?

640
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,180
You people have heard of mesquite.

641
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,960
Yeah, very hardy.

642
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,560
And it's it was about a 15 year old tree, almost 20,

643
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,320
actually about more than 20 year old tree.

644
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,120
But still, it died, just died.

645
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,120
Right. And I have a pizza oven.

646
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,700
I don't mind going up to the tree and pulling off dry branches for the pizza oven.

647
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,180
But outside. But here's the thing.

648
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,400
There's the environment is being extremely stressed, at least here in the southwest.

649
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,880
And here's one thing.

650
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,720
Will him right came to the Tucson in 1952, 53 time to break a drought

651
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,400
that was ongoing for a few years.

652
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,280
And he did. Right.

653
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,680
And they asked him, why?

654
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,240
Why did you pick here?

655
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,740
And he says, because all of the ether, you know, the weather,

656
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,020
the weather causing ethereal elements enter

657
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,260
the southwest at this area for for that effect,

658
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,400
the entire North America and Europe.

659
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,660
Right. This is the entry point of the cosmic ether where I am.

660
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,140
OK. And this is this is according to Wilhelm.

661
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,780
Right. And I've been playing with it.

662
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,280
And I could see it is pretty valid.

663
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,620
So if I'm not getting any kind of simulation or growth here,

664
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,240
in terms of vegetation, naturally, what's going on everywhere else?

665
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,620
Right. This is the entry point. Right.

666
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,240
Very interesting, as this is.

667
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,220
It's kind of disturbing to to ponder this over the past few weeks.

668
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,660
And I just figured I wanted to inject it into the conversation.

669
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,860
What do you think is is the cause for that effect?

670
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,740
Stress, stress, obviously.

671
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,040
Like, for example, it's a fertility issue.

672
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,780
But what is causing that stress?

673
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,520
What is what is the cosmic?

674
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,000
It's cosmic, totally cosmic, because the air quality hasn't changed noticeably.

675
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
Materially, I don't OK.

676
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,320
I don't see a material cause for it.

677
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
OK, that's what I was right.

678
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,660
A material, it's a non-material cause.

679
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,600
So that's open. Well, that's what I remember.

680
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,600
No matter how much we.

681
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,280
Some people in Arizona reported to me that there were,

682
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,640
you know, increased chemtrails and this and that.

683
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,600
And I said, OK, you know, I never know what to make of that.

684
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,540
You know, the worst chemtrails was more than 10 years ago.

685
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,960
It was really bad. Right.

686
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,140
All year round. Not anymore.

687
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,600
Well, yeah, this year it was reported to me, though, that it increased again.

688
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,400
And I wasn't and I said, well, I don't know what is that actually.

689
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,780
It's it's always a little bit.

690
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,520
Not much. I remember 10 years ago, it was really bad.

691
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,940
I mean, they were doing literally like half of a tic-tac-toe in the sky.

692
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,220
OK, literally the grid with the zero and the X's, you know,

693
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,300
but not completing the game. Right. Yeah. OK. OK.

694
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,640
No, I look, I'm asking because I I'm not able to observe it.

695
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,640
I'm, you know, on the other the other.

696
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,340
Yeah, no, it's not it's not material.

697
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,740
And so it's not chemtrails. It's not harp. It's not.

698
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,500
Right. So it's nonmaterial.

699
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,160
It's a natural. It's a cosmic nonmaterial.

700
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,740
Now, no matter how much people,

701
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,360
whether it's the Greek or other people talking about ether and actually

702
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,220
putting out information, how to make practical devices and all this,

703
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,280
we've all been raised in a culture where we have to break away from

704
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,720
to see and acknowledge the nonmaterial. Right.

705
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,220
Because we're told everything is material.

706
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,880
Atoms and electrons and things like that. Ridiculous stuff.

707
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,900
Anything else is a figment of your imagination. Right. Right.

708
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,520
So, you know, you have to break away.

709
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,000
So this is like the breakaway group, you know, that thinks about these things.

710
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,840
So when you say nonmaterial, we don't know.

711
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,080
But acknowledging it is is is enough to start, you know, pondering it.

712
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,760
Yes, it can be effective.

713
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,060
I know that if I dedicated

714
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,360
anywhere between 10 to 30 days, I can change the environment drastically.

715
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,200
You know, using the ethereal devices, basically basic water guns

716
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,060
and other things from Trevor James Constable and things that I've developed

717
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,240
along those lines, it could drastically change

718
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,540
the environment.

719
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,760
But without doing that, just seeing what's going on is very unusual.

720
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,840
Is this a reduction of water in the environment?

721
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,400
I mean, is that part of the stress?

722
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,620
Like it's been dried out?

723
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,700
Water is material.

724
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,800
Because I would think without the grass growing.

725
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
But water is.

726
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,620
You know, we had a lot of season.

727
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,440
We had a lot of monsoon material.

728
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,560
Yeah. OK. OK.

729
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,540
That's something that is stressing.

730
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,220
OK, here's another way to put it.

731
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,360
During times of war or women in prison or women,

732
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,200
they stop menstruating during times of stress when women is very stressed.

733
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,440
Let's say a woman that is in the age or time of her life

734
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,480
where she menstruates, meaning that she's ovulating.

735
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,780
Yeah, that ovulation cycle stops.

736
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,860
It's during times of high stress, turns around and skips.

737
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,140
And it does all kinds of weird.

738
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,460
So it stops. It just stops.

739
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,200
It'll be this.

740
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,860
You could read about during the wars in Europe and all that,

741
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,660
that women did not menstruate for years.

742
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,820
And then when the wars were over, they started again.

743
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,120
So not all, but most most, believe it or not, more than half.

744
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,180
So so this is just, you know, some simple example that you see

745
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,100
animals in zoos, right?

746
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,900
They write, why are they having a baby?

747
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,240
You know, why isn't the lion right?

748
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,480
Why isn't the pandas right?

749
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,820
The pandas was the big one, right?

750
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,420
Yeah, they're stressed out from captivity.

751
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,180
I mean, that's not material.

752
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,960
It's not because they have all the food.

753
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,820
They have all the water.

754
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,480
They have all the comfort, right? Right.

755
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,580
But they it's an immature, immaterial, immaterial.

756
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,980
Sounds like a more it's not a material factor

757
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,520
that is not considered by the mindset of the people that are on the surface.

758
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,780
Now, I always have to qualify on the surface.

759
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,780
Sincerely, Greek speak surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

760
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,600
If you if you remember Greek speak from way back in the days,

761
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,480
I've always said surface dwelling earth inhabitants to imply

762
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,720
what that there are earth inhabitants that are not surface dwelling.

763
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,100
Right. Could be above the surface.

764
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,280
Could be below the surface.

765
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,580
Mostly. Yeah, mostly.

766
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,460
And both above and below.

767
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,980
If you have to mention that they're on the surface, then that means there is other.

768
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,400
Yes. But yeah, try to be specific when you want to guide them.

769
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,860
You know, the thinking process. That's exactly right.

770
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,700
Right. I understand all this.

771
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,740
Well, OK, but the stress on the environment, it's it's an odd thing.

772
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,620
Because the material.

773
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,300
So then, yeah, go ahead and point at it.

774
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,900
You can't. It's immaterial. Right.

775
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,440
So but you have to understand the reactions.

776
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,180
You can still ask why, though, right?

777
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah, that's that's pretty important.

778
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,440
That's what this is rated. Why isn't it?

779
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,320
Of course. Of course.

780
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,180
But that's that's my that's my question, though.

781
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,740
It's like, why now?

782
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,920
I mean, are we because you're saying that?

783
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,640
OK, I've got an answer for that.

784
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,280
You want to hear the smarty pants answer?

785
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,520
Because when you things are thrown at you that are, quote unquote, problems

786
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,600
and you have a solution, go ahead.

787
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,740
Then if you think you can do it, implement the solution.

788
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,900
So if it's strictly just the grass not growing.

789
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,820
Yeah, we can make the grass grow a simple water gun.

790
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,400
Wilhelm Rake water gun not fully charged and grounded with no water

791
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,340
will make create green greenery.

792
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,880
By the way, the there was a big drought,

793
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,560
touted drought in California in 2013.

794
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,360
Twenty fourteen was big in the news.

795
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,500
Headlines is to stress people out, quote unquote.

796
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,700
And I was like, oh, I'll try to make rain in California.

797
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
And while I was trying to make rain in California, it greened up.

798
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,380
It greened up all of California without any rain.

799
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,660
And NASA, actually, you could still look it up.

800
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,320
Twenty thirteen NASA photographs of high altitude

801
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,120
photographs of California vegetation.

802
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,200
It's still up online.

803
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,320
It'll show you the year before the drought.

804
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,980
Most of the state is pretty brown with some green spots.

805
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,660
But the year of the drought, the entire state's greened up.

806
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,800
How is that possible?

807
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,880
Yeah, that makes no sense in the material, in the material sense.

808
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,680
It makes sense.

809
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,780
But if you if I just if you understand that a Wilhelm Rake type device

810
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,820
that is well grounded with no water running and it will do that.

811
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,220
Right. Well, it makes complete sense then because you could scientifically,

812
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,640
you know, you can go to a place

813
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,880
that doesn't have green and make it green.

814
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,880
You don't want to redeem the deserts because the dust storms

815
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,620
the deserts produce are vital to the fish crops, by the way,

816
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,679
because the dust storms go into high, not low level dust storms,

817
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,980
but high altitude dust storms that form in deserts are carried

818
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,900
throughout the high altitude and are deposited in the ocean.

819
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,340
And guess who likes to eat that silica dust?

820
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
Plankton. Plankton.

821
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,120
And the plankton are really, really small,

822
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,120
but they're eaten by things that are a little bigger.

823
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,120
And those things are eaten by things that are slightly larger.

824
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,000
And those things are eaten by things that are right.

825
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,020
So they're at the beginning of the food chain.

826
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,900
Yeah, I mean, they showed us that in cartoons years ago, right?

827
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,940
Where you would see the little fish gets eaten by the bigger fish

828
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,100
is eaten by the bigger fish.

829
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,719
This is starting to sound like a cartoon. I get it.

830
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
But here's the thing.

831
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,620
If you cut off the head of the top of the food chain,

832
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,960
which is the smallest thing by cutting off the silica by

833
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,140
because you redeem the desert, right, you will lose the fish crop.

834
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,740
And the big that we're talking about, the big fish crops,

835
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
you know, the ones that the commercial fisheries,

836
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,440
you know, like the sardines, the tuna, the right, everything that depends on.

837
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,540
Right. The mass, the massive crops. I get it.

838
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,580
Yeah. So the deserts are a function.

839
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,020
If you would like the type of fish that you're harvesting,

840
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,440
if the deserts were all redeemed and we went into, again,

841
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,720
a pre Noah vapor type canopy

842
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,780
ice field around the earth,

843
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,720
you would have a different type of fish crop.

844
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,360
But in that situation, you wouldn't need to do agriculture things.

845
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,680
There'd be so much vegetation and animal life.

846
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,340
You would just have to go outside your door and your food would be there.

847
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,620
Well, being that this is a cosmic implementation, right?

848
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,580
Can we determine the reasoning for that?

849
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,000
Or is this an indicator of cyclical reasoning?

850
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,120
Always. OK, you always apply cyclical reasoning to any process.

851
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,560
Right. So, you know, baby crawls on his newborn baby,

852
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,820
crawls on, you know, on his all fours when you're really, really old.

853
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,180
You crawl on all fours. Right.

854
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,900
So it's a cycle. Yeah. Right.

855
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
OK, well, so it's just a cycle.

856
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,060
So you got crazies.

857
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,120
You got crazies going in both ways, crazies that want to fix it.

858
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,840
And you got crazies that want to fix it and can fix it.

859
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,780
By the way, most crazies that want to fix it can't fix anything, by the way.

860
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,400
And then you've got the crazies that want to blame something else

861
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,580
and will never fix it.

862
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,360
But they're the ones that are most suited for this environment.

863
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,500
The ones that don't you know, the ones just make a lot of noise.
