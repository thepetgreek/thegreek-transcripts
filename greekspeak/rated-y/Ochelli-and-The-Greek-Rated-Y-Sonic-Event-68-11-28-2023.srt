1
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,320
So, Sonic Event 68, I believe it is, and here we are, Greek, you know, they brought up in

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,180
the chat room a couple of things, so let's start with the most practical, right, which,

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,720
what is the number one tool I would say that anyone needs at any time for any purpose,

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,680
whether it's to cook or to survive or... Oh, yeah, yeah, right. A blade. A blade. Yeah,

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,660
a blade, yeah. And they asked about sharpening. A jig. It depends on where you are. It could

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,800
be called a jig in other places. Oh, okay. But anyway, that's if you're a gnome. Fair enough,

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,500
fair enough. But it is, look, it's easily, you know, you need to be able to cut things,

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,920
to shape things, I mean, absolutely, right, to be able to eat, to be able to clean your food,

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,460
especially meat, to be able to properly prepare vegetables. I mean, a sharp blade,

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,360
and you brought up how important it is to have a quality blade and to make sure that these things

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,640
are sharp, obviously, because... At least one quality blade, yeah. Okay. Start off with that.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,440
Why? Why do I say at least one? Right. You said blade, not blades, because they're expensive,

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,020
and they always were. To put it in context, a good used car was about where you, the equivalent

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,680
of a good used car today was what you were expected to pay for, let's say, as something

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,340
that appeared to be like a sword back in the days. Yeah, yeah, that's not right. Yeah, it was

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,600
in the thousands, and compared to, you know, if you look comparative, you know, what money buys,

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,560
let's say. Right. And it's still, so they're much, when you look at a $200 kitchen knife, that's

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,680
cheap. Oh, very much so. I mean, comparatively. Like we talked about the pots, right? And you

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,660
said, look, you can go get a set of pots for $100 for sure, and you know, you'll be able to cook with

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,920
them for a little bit, and they'll eventually look good. For a lot of people, that's all they have

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,960
their whole life. Right. That's okay. It's not being snobbish. It's a decent pot. If you were

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,020
to just get one pot, let's say, it would be over $100 minimum. Right. For one pot, for at least

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,620
something that you can actually control the heat with. But anyway, go back to the knife. Somebody

24
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,780
posted a knife sharpener, which is the one with the strut support to hold the angle.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
Anybody that's worked in tooling and machine shops or whatever, any kind of precision tool,

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
you don't sharpen it freehand, you know? Right. You don't hold it up to the grinder or the stone

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,180
freehand, unless you are a knife smith kind of person. Right. And then you understand the angles,

28
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,680
you understand. Right. It's kind of like, you know, when you see baseball being played by the

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,940
pitcher and the hitter, who's at base, they don't have any jigs or struts holding them in place,

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,660
but they have full muscle, muscular and agility control. Right. By the way, that's why I say

31
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,240
sports are all fixed. Do you know that? And I learned this from hanging around some B team.

32
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,580
A team is, you know, the big, you know, they have a B team, right? Like there's Yankees, Mets.

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,560
That's the ones you see on TV is the A team, but they also have a B team, right? Which is ready.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,620
We hear about a rookie coming up, right? They already have another team. You know, the guys,

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,960
right. Okay. Anyone on the A team or B team, I found this from a B team person 20 years ago. He

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,240
says, anyone talked about sports being fixed. So yeah, it's all fixed, but we don't talk about it

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,100
because it's been known for, you know, almost a hundred years or, or, you know, since the big

38
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,980
games became quote unquote professional, because before they became professional, they were,

39
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,640
they were social gatherings more, you know? Right. Baseball. Indeed. You bring up baseball.

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,960
I like that one because that was a social gathering, right? I mean, towns,

41
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,640
but here's my point. What I got. And I got asked since then for more than one,

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,920
anyone that goes up to bat can hit the ball every time and put it exactly where you want it

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,880
every time. That's some of the time every time. So what you're actually watching when you watch a

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,940
baseball game is something like WWF world federation, right? You know, the, what's that,

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,480
what's that called? Theatrical wrestling, right? Well, that's the difference between Greco and

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,900
theatrical wrestling, right? These guys, if they really were punching each other, I mean,

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,000
they do say they can kill each other. They do serious damage. I mean, a 300, 400 pound guy,

48
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,260
you know, it's theatrical. Yeah. Yeah. So, so what do I mean by this is if you can be like,

49
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,360
not like what you see, which is, you know, a game of random happenstance based on certain

50
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,180
select talents that happen to do better than others on baseball. No, they can all hit the

51
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,940
ball every time anywhere you want it within a pretty good tolerance. Right. Okay. So that means

52
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,020
that that kind of, they have that much control, but they don't show it at all. Right. Just otherwise

53
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,020
there wouldn't be much of a game. Uh, so when you're sharpening knife, if you have that control,

54
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,440
in other words, if you can hold a knife freehand over a stone or a owning, uh, or whatever,

55
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,220
whatever system you're going to use to form an edge, if you have that kind of control,

56
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,860
right. Uh, and you can rationalize what angle you want and measure it and see that you get it. Also,

57
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:31,020
you need, uh, you need, what's called a sight glass or a magnifier. And I loop will do like a

58
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,880
five X I loop or an eight X I loop. Right. Um, most people, if an eye loop is just like a

59
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,120
magnifying glass, you've seen people hold them up to their eyes, to look at jewelry and other

60
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,240
things like that. If you work in mining or whatever, you carry one in your pocket.

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,220
So, uh, use an eye loop to look at what you're doing. And by the way, the ancients had this,

62
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,360
they were called, um, looking glass. So wherever you can James Bible,

63
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,540
when they were building the tabernacle, they wove the tapestry and the, the young

64
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,880
women and they used a looking glass. Right. What's a looking way. Right. So,

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,940
and they also had looking glass to look at the stars. So microscopes and telescopes have always

66
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,400
been around. Right. A lot of people think of looking glass as a mirror though. And it's

67
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,080
sometimes it is also, yeah. Well, you wouldn't use a mirror to weave a fine tapestry. You would be

68
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,220
using a magnifier. Right. Yeah. So you have to look at the context. Yeah. It's like one thing

69
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,060
that's used all around a word that could be kicked around, which we'll get into some other things

70
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,180
that words have been kicked around soon. But so my point here is this, if you can get a good blade

71
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,120
now here, here, I'm going to confess most of the knives that I have that I still take pride in. I

72
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:46,140
buy it at, at, um, surplus stores like Ross or TJ max or Marshall home goods. Um, uh, and it doesn't

73
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,340
matter what brand they are. I could look at the steel and know if it's good steel or not. Right.

74
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,060
And then I have a good Japanese blade, but, um, that's one of the things that mass production,

75
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,280
uh, things get better, but they may not work better because of the last few finishing items

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,920
that are necessary, uh, to make them work better or not. They're like back in the days of VCRs,

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,540
when they got really cheap, they only lasted a few weeks and they broke down. Why? Because they

78
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,620
just didn't use a good enough bearing on the capstan. One little tiny part, instead of spending

79
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,520
a 25 cents on it, they spent 2 cents. If they just spent 20 cents more,

80
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,720
the VCRs would have lasted almost indefinitely. You see how foolish manufacture, how it's gotten.

81
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,500
So yeah, that was crazy. Cause that would be the one thing that would tangle up your tape.

82
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,120
You would get mangled tapes really quickly because of this one little tiny part.

83
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,540
Yeah. It's 20, 20 cents difference over a hundred dollar item. They still didn't do it. So,

84
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,960
okay. So what do I mean by this is if you have very good control,

85
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,880
I would recommend, go ahead, get it, you know, go ahead and keep your knife sharp.

86
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,560
There was a, uh, a strut based, uh, a knife sharpener that someone posted. Those are good.

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,160
I've used those before too, but I don't need them. I can do just as well without it. But that's me,

88
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,540
right? That's like, if you go up in a professional team and they tell you, Chuck or Greek, get on the,

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,280
get on, get on the plate and go ahead and hit, I won't be able to hit any of them,

90
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,520
you know, that are pitched at me. Right. Right. But if I was one of them, I could hit every one

91
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,580
anywhere. Right. So when you get to a certain level and by the way, it's taken me almost 20

92
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,640
years to figure out knife sharpening, because I wasn't happy with a lot of the, you know,

93
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,260
quote unquote, freehand instructions that were given out there. It's like, Oh my gosh. That's

94
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,840
why one of the things I've always been discussing recently is the biggest, one of the biggest

95
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,120
problems people have is communication. Yes. When, when someone can do something or see something or

96
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,800
right. They can't communicate it to someone else in a way. It just doesn't make any sense. It's

97
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,080
a, what do you call it? It's like all crosstalk or information's left out. So yeah, very interesting.

98
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,840
So, and I've mentioned this over and over and over, you must be able to communicate.

99
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,960
So I found out that the best way to do it for me to learn was I was watching Japanese knife and

100
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,220
sword makers and it was all hardcore Japanese stuff, you know, no talking and all that. And

101
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,960
I was just watching how he held his hand when he was honing the blade and sharpening the blade

102
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,300
and putting an edge on the blade. I just said it all in reverse. What you do first is you put an

103
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,260
edge on the blade, then you sharpen that edge and then you hone that edge. That's the order.

104
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,320
What's also important of a good blade is what do you call, well, what do you in war,

105
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,420
when you run out of bullets, what do you have sticking out at the end of your gun?

106
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,900
A bayonet, right? So you're out of bullets, but you could still defend yourself, right?

107
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,900
And if you put it on a stick that's really long, it's a spear. And if you make it really small and

108
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:53,180
light and put it on a quill and shoot it from a high tension, whatever, it's an arrow. So it's

109
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:00,540
not just a blade. It's not just a knife. It's a weapon in many forms. You can make micro darts

110
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,020
that you can shoot out of a straw basically, or a pipe, and that's called a blow gun, an air gun.

111
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:18,500
By the way, there are 50 caliber air guns now, 50 cal pellet guns. So some of these ex-felons

112
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:25,340
who are not allowed to own a firearm, they could pack a 50 caliber air gun, which at five feet

113
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,960
will kill you, by the way. Well, because technically speaking, it's not a firearm, is it?

114
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,780
Right. No, it's not. Actually, technically speaking, in legal terms, firearms,

115
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,600
the federal law is definition of a firearm is a machine gun, chemical weapons, grenades,

116
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,460
or shotgun modified to a length of less than 20 inches. So a 45 pistol is not a firearm,

117
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:55,500
but they still call it that, right? I've seen this used in legal terms. It's like federal

118
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,500
charges for bringing a gun into Washington, D.C. They kept saying firearms. It's not a firearm.

119
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,140
I had a nine millimeter Glock and a 45. It's not a firearm. Look at the law,

120
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,220
and they're all like standing there. Oh, but you have a contract. You signed and you said you would,

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,520
so now it goes to contract law, which is another thing I wanted to maybe start a small series on

122
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,160
because someone in the chat posted, why don't we talk about legislation and jurisdiction of

123
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,260
courts and things like that? Well, how do you finagle that when no one there knows what's

124
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,940
going on at all, at all? Well, and two of the most famous cases of firearms, once again, in quotes,

125
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,020
being the cause for people being gone after, you know, you think about Waco, you think about Randy

126
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,480
Weaver. What were two of the biggest problems? Modification of a shotgun, like you just brought

127
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,060
up. Yeah, it's a modified shotgun, machine gun, chemical weapons or grenades. If so,

128
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:58,480
a 38, a 45, a Glock is not a firearm. A 30 rifle, 35 rifle is not a firearm. It's interesting, but

129
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,140
you see how they overuse the term? Of course, of course. I have seen Homeland Security come

130
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,760
after someone for something that happened in the airport and they're charging all this stuff. And I

131
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,280
looked at this. So where did the hell did they get the definitions? Because none of the supplies

132
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,120
and they wrote back and they said they got the definitions and the charging instrument,

133
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:25,640
you know, the letter from Webster's Dictionary. This is how idiotic. Yeah. So that's why when I

134
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,240
saw the comment about talk about jurisdiction, legislation, well, how do you deal with people

135
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,180
that no one there knows what's going on? Yeah, they're using a book that's supposed to show you

136
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,060
diction to give definition, even though the definition is incidental.

137
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,740
Oh, that's that's that's something you want to avoid. But you just basically look up the

138
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,840
my favorite. What I like to just stick with is two things. One thing is none of their laws at all,

139
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,860
except for the Declaration of Independence, which is not codified as law. It's actually

140
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,300
archived by the way. Legally, when something is archived means it's no longer in use. So when you

141
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,600
go to the National Archives, guess what they have their Declaration of Independence, the U.S.

142
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:17,920
Constitution. Should I go on? Yeah, look it up. So the other thing is, OK, the thing that I use,

143
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,760
I would use for them is first of all, people is never in any of their codes, rules, regulations

144
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,440
or laws. Never. It's persons. Right. And a person is defined as a corporation, a trust, fictional

145
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,780
entity. Right. Yep. Whatever. But if you're endorsing private credit, like I've talked about,

146
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,160
you start. So here's the thing. You go in there talking like this. The judge has the clerk sitting

147
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,900
next to him. There's different clerks. His clerk of the court is the clerk of the of the judge.

148
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,460
Right. They have a little laptop or computer that's next to them. And while they call your

149
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,140
name and up there, that person pulls up from the attorney general's office all of your information,

150
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,620
everything you've ever done since third grade. So if you have a passport, a bank account,

151
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,640
a credit card, whatever, whatever, you start talking this way, he's going to say,

152
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,720
I know, Jack, I see you got a passport and you're a member of one of those nasty veterans associations

153
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,260
and blah, blah, blah. Right. Tell him how long he gets, Joe. Joe, tell him how long,

154
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,860
how many years he's going to get. Right. So you got. Yeah. So that's the other thing.

155
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,720
But when I say the people is never in any of the laws and the way they tell you you're not a people.

156
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,660
The other thing is all of their codes that are in sections, you know,

157
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,260
or articles, you know, one through 50 or one through 20, whatever. Yeah. Usually you go

158
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:47,640
up to 50. Most states only go up to the 30s or 20s. Anyway, if just the first and second

159
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,960
articles or chapters of their codes, first two up to five in the US code is definitions.

160
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,880
So you just stick with that. There's no people in there either. And it defines very clearly what

161
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,380
things are. So it doesn't matter which code or title they charge you with. By definition, none

162
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,860
of it applies to you. And then the prosecutor will say, well, you think that the law doesn't

163
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,460
apply to, you know, absolutely does. That's why I'm bringing this up to catch 22 for them. So

164
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,940
that's the way you handle with these idiots, because they're all idiots. And the same with

165
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,220
a medical, whatever, you know, if people go to a medical, this is all tied into because the legal

166
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,160
and the whatever runs the medical, if you don't believe it, go have an offhand discussion with

167
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,940
any medical person that's state certified or whatever state license, they bring up like

168
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,860
some natural remedy. And they'll say, well, legally, I can't say what. So the whole time

169
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,660
you were diagnosing me like that was all legal function. We were making legal determinations

170
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,560
when you told me I have diabetes. That's a legal determination. Yes, it is. He won't answer that.

171
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,020
Also, when they say you should have a certain procedure done because of this condition,

172
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:06,440
say I want you to sign it, write me an affidavit and sign it. Right, right. And he can never do it.

173
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Never. The most you're going to do is send you a lab report and say that, well, you've been

174
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
diagnosed, diagnosed. Remember, 70% of diagnoses are misdiagnoses.

175
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,500
Will assume a potential not that you haven't don't have, you know, you were diagnosed with

176
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,220
what is potentially a serious illness. So presumptive and people take it as if they're

177
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,280
saying that they have this. It's just like when the World Trade Center in the first 10 minutes,

178
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,220
they put a picture of Osama bin Laden. One of the suspects of this might be Osama bin Laden.

179
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,720
And the people on the street is Osama bin Laden did it. No one ever said Osama bin Laden did

180
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,740
anything. Right. But the people take the city. Right. So so it's all presumptive. So anyway,

181
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,920
there's your own flavor, because with the jurisdiction and the courts and the legislation,

182
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,820
legislation is totally hands off, by the way. So there's just nobody there. Look, if you

183
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,300
sure there are people there that know what it is or whatever, pretty evil.

184
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,380
But if you show outwardly that, you know, the law, they will get rid of you right away. The

185
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,400
same with the medical issue. They will show you the door and tell you to leave the organization.

186
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,940
So is the Greek saying that the entire medical judiciary and all that is completely corrupt and

187
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,020
inept? Yes, absolutely. But there are exceptions and the exceptions, like I've always said,

188
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,620
there are two types. One is the person who just woke up to what's going on and is looking for

189
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,380
an exit strategy. What do I mean by an exit strategy? I just got hired on for 150 grand

190
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,220
working as a whatever assistant D.A. and they found out what's going on. It's totally wrong

191
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,300
based on any ethics or morality they might involve in their personal quest on this planet. Right.

192
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,700
And they're like, my gosh, I've got a quarter of a million in school loans. How am I going to pay

193
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,460
that? I mean, how am I going to pay the money? How am I going to survive? What's my wife and

194
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,580
kids going to say if I leave? So they take anywhere between two weeks and two years to

195
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,800
find an exit strategy, like get out of there. Right. Right. The other option is that you got

196
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,040
some real evil people that know that it's bad and they just keep doing it because that's just

197
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,140
what they are. These are like the kind of people that would burn bugs with a magnifying glass

198
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,660
or and when they got older and they could have some loose change or an ounce,

199
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,400
they're going by poisons and poison the family dog. Right. Then or break. You know what I mean?

200
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,540
Like that old psychopaths. Look, bitch, you knew I was a scorpion when you brought me in here.

201
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah. So you have some of those in there, too. And everybody else is just NPC all the way across.

202
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,920
It's kind of interesting. It's funny how now when eight years ago or 10, 15 years ago,

203
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,700
speaking to people, I'm saying, you know, 95 percent of the population is zombie. You know,

204
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,440
I didn't use the word NPC. They have no value whatsoever. Oh, no, it's only 30 percent. Now

205
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
people are saying it's more like 90 percent. Finally, they're catching and nothing much has

206
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,380
changed. It's just that their perception has changed because of certain events that have

207
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,620
come across. Right. Like with the vaccine, people are all up in arms with the vaccine. I'm like,

208
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,760
what do you mean? No humans took that vaccine. Yeah. But there was one hundred fifty million

209
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,520
Americans that took that vaccine. I'm like, let me repeat myself. There are no humans that

210
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,260
took that vaccine. I don't care if three hundred and fifty million Americans, no humans have ever

211
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,580
taken that vaccine. Sorry. They're like, what do you mean? I'm like, oh, boy, you don't see it.

212
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,140
You don't see it. Right. Right. So. All right. So anyway, back to the question,

213
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,140
we went a long way from knives. You got to have sharp blades, because by the way,

214
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,680
if society collapsed, people like I've got my guns to protect myself. You'll run out of bullets

215
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,740
really fast, especially when people figure out you have a gun. Why? Because they're going to

216
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,980
try to get it from you. And most right. If you have it because they think it's worth something

217
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,860
to they're just as dumb as you are. So what will happen is they'll make their effort. You have to

218
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,680
sleep. Right. They'll try to take it when you're not shooting. He's asleep. Let's go take gun.

219
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,480
You'll shoot off some more bullets to keep them even further away. Right. Right. So you'll be

220
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,460
shooting up. So once people figure out you have a gun of any kind, they want it. And I assure you,

221
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,440
if you think you have a three month supply of bullets, you'll be gone in three days. Why?

222
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,060
Because the people, again, want it and they will make a concerted effort to take it from you. And

223
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:20,160
that concerted effort will make you use more bullets. Yeah. Yeah. So it's OK. So if you do

224
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,060
have a gun for when the society collapses or whatnot, do not use it unless it is absolutely

225
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,020
necessary. And you are on the run, on the go. In other words, you are not using it out of where

226
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:37,020
you plan on staying put. You're already on the road and you're moving and you're using it as

227
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,160
a defense or offense in a mobile situation, never stationary home base situation. It's the opposite

228
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,960
of what they tell you. There's even ads. But you want to protect your home base and your family

229
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,160
with a gun or whatever, you know, those gun ads, commercial, whatever. Fewer and fewer of them.

230
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,800
This is a while back is when Obama took office. Remember, everybody, all the patriots were like,

231
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,940
oh, we got to get our guns now. Right. Yeah, of course. Country's going down.

232
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:09,580
So, like, no, you never let if you're keeping a castle or a home base, you'd never want anyone

233
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,120
to know you have that stuff because that's what they want. And you're going to end up right. So,

234
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,720
OK, you get the point, right? Right. That's like the only purpose to have those kinds of weapons

235
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:25,580
for the trajectory of a firearm type stuff. I'm saying is when you're mobile. Basically,

236
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,080
you drive by or when you're driving down the road, they try to take you over.

237
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,940
Mad Max style. You open up on them. Right. Only then do you use it. Yeah. All right.

238
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,660
Right. Left side about that. Exactly. By the way, I've never heard anyone say that, by the way,

239
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,620
online that you shouldn't have a gun. Well, I mean, if you do have a gun, don't ever let anyone

240
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,720
know you have it and don't fire it if you're in a stationary situation like your home or your

241
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,820
castle or wherever, only when you're on the move. But good. Well, it's just like those people who

242
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,700
store up all kinds of stuff. I mean, and everybody knows they have it. And I'm like, well, you're a

243
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,540
target. Yeah, you're a target. Yeah. The people that just ran out that they're going to come.

244
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,380
You know. Yeah. You're going to have to do. Yeah. If it's a society cop situation,

245
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,860
you have to act as if you have no food and water, no matter how much food and water you have.

246
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,040
Right. So you have to be told in deception mode. I'm talking about to the public image that you

247
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,900
put out. Yeah. I mean, it seems like the best thing to invest in really is camouflage to make

248
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,900
it disappear. You know, whatever it is, you disappear when you're right. Right. So, yeah.

249
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,860
Anything that you have that's desirable, you could others might know that you have it. It's

250
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:42,240
if you're on if you're out of there, if you are all in and all FT running off. Right.

251
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,700
If you're running off, then it's OK because you're running. And but so if you whatever

252
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,300
neighborhood you live in, if everything starts going down, do you have any food or water? No,

253
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,760
I don't. Do you have any food or you don't have any food and water either? It doesn't matter

254
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,680
how much food and water you have always. Right. Because you're right. So the first thing they're

255
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,800
going to do is let's see if we can find somebody with some so we can go take it.

256
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,880
It's not only on a personal level. Let's say you've got a community of 50 households that

257
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,880
do have food and water and you're all cool with it within a matter of time. You pick at the time,

258
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,240
whether a few hours, hours, days or weeks. Others that another community will find out

259
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,700
that this community has. And then you'll all be in danger. So no one should ever show.

260
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:34,020
Right. Ever. Right. Right. Yeah. Unless, again, you're on the run or you're so isolated.

261
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,060
Right. You put up a facade. Yeah, this is by the way, everything that I'm saying is known by anyone

262
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,080
who's just visited this planet. But it seems like the people who were born here have no clue.

263
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Anyway. So the blade idea is very, very smart. And the worst time to figure out how to get a

264
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,620
sharp knife or make a sharp knife is when you need it. That's the worst time. Right. Right.

265
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:09,000
So it's very important. Now, it's a matter of preference, of course. But you can't say what

266
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,320
I'm saying is a matter of opinion when having a sharp blade has been important all the way back.

267
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,000
And how far back do you want to go in history? Right. Probably. How far? It's it's prized

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,720
possession. Always. Yeah. All known history. Yeah. So forget. Yeah. The other thing that you

269
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,640
would skip the gunpowder and go right to energy weapons, which is another thing. Right. We'll

270
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,040
discuss maybe in the future. You want to go from blades to energy weapons. Forget about projectile

271
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,420
gunpowder, chemical stuff in the middle. So energy weapons are cool, too, where you push a button in

272
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,860
every one of them, a 50 foot radius. If you have any shillings in their mouth, they go up to 350

273
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,560
degrees. That will get their attention very quickly. Right. Right. So, OK.

274
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,880
So titles you brought up. Yeah. Well, the last thing I flip. Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry.

275
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,700
Well, that's I believe the word is Teflon. Somebody I'm going to get in front of the

276
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,860
computer and look. But that term was brought up the house gods or house idols. That was brought

277
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,040
up in the book of Kings when King David was on the run from on the land from Saul and he came to his

278
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,040
house and his wife said he's in his bed and they went and he wasn't in his bed. He put an idol in

279
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,680
the bed and they thought it was him. Right. Just a delay. Just to. Right. You know, the typical

280
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,920
thing where you even when you were young, you know, you you're out all night. You put something

281
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,020
in the bed, make it look you're sleeping in bed. You see this on television. Somebody puts a

282
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,840
basketball under the blanket to make it look like a head and then put some things underneath. So it's

283
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,800
kind of like maybe it could be the length of a body or so. And people think you're still in your

284
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,440
bed and you're actually out the window. Yeah. OK. Exactly. That's what King David did. And he

285
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,780
used the house idol, the Teflon. Why would they have it? Because that's what they have. I mean,

286
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,200
here's the thing where people don't understand. I had someone that was very messianic, messy,

287
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,480
messianic, you know, to Christians out there, mixed Judaism and Judaism that makes Christianity

288
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,780
thinks it makes it better. Right. He stood over the house. This is 12, 15 years ago.

289
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,580
I actually gave him a car and all that. He was trying to go out and be more real about

290
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,040
scripture. That's fine. I felt sorry for him. He goes to this lady that I recommended in New Mexico

291
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,160
and she was pretty wealthy and she was also a messianic. And they had many properties and

292
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,960
with their husband before he died, dedicated a lot of money to art museums and things.

293
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,180
And they had all these art statues in the house. And he gets there and he goes, oh,

294
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,420
I don't know if I could stay here, Greek. She's got the house is full of idols. She says she wants

295
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,460
to study scripture and be faithful. But she has idols. I said, well, what makes them idols? Is she

296
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,020
bowing down and praying to them or are they just works of art? What's the difference between an

297
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:59,020
idol and a statue? Absolutely nothing in material form. What makes them different is that you bow

298
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,060
down to one and pray to one and the other one is just decorative value. I mean, you see like a bust

299
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,100
of George Washington, right? Those are not an idol. It's not an idol. It's just a piece of art

300
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,180
representative of a historical thing. Exactly. So don't be so sensitive. It's all programming,

301
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,060
right? You know how many times people say, you know, they hear like, if you're not feeling

302
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,540
you got to go to a doctor or the doctor, like there's the doctor, right? Or you got to go to

303
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,600
the hospital, the hospital, like there's one hospital, right? That's programming. That's

304
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,520
all programming, you know, automatic reaction. So they see a statue. It's an idol. No, it's not.

305
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,960
Well, it's like somebody has a crossbar in their backyard. You look at it and go,

306
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,600
you have a giant cross erected in your backyard. And they're like, no, that's just the best design

307
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,180
to hang the laundry off of, you know, it looks kind of cool, like with rappers and rock and roll

308
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,400
people, they wear them. It's just the cross is literally about the crossing. It's a celestial

309
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,900
event. There's also the Southern Cross that we don't see here, but our friends in the upside down

310
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,040
Australia and that part of the world, let's say South America do see it. By the way,

311
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,300
the most interesting part of the sky that we can see is down there. That's where everything's

312
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,300
really happening. In other words, when you do get sky phenomenon, that is based on the ecliptic,

313
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,680
you know, east to west. It's most of the best sky phenomenon are viewed down like down by

314
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,100
down under or, you know, the near southern half of the continent of Africa or South America,

315
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,300
not up here. I just want to throw that in there. So anyway, the cross is just a symbol. It's a

316
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,060
decorative symbol, whatever. Of course, if you've been listening to Greek speak for more than

317
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,900
maybe a few hours, you know that there is no crucifixion in the Bible, no matter how many

318
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,400
times they put that word in there. Right. So, yeah. Yeah. But it's interesting to me. It's

319
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,580
like it's just I've heard this conversation a couple of times where it's like, why do you have

320
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,000
a giant cross in your backyard? Well, that's just really where we string the clothesline from.

321
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,680
And we get separate. It's a good structure. It's a strong structure. So it can be. It can be. Yeah.

322
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,260
So, yeah. So we covered house idols. There's not much more to talk about the house gods or

323
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,740
house idols, because many people would see things in many different ways. Also, you know, a lot of

324
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,120
history that we've got now about things that happened in the past is just simply not true.

325
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,380
You know what the funny thing is, is a long time ago, and I can't remember if it was through you

326
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,360
or with somebody else. But quite honestly, they said, you know, you can find those crosses around

327
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:29,160
people's necks represented in art long before. Oh, yeah. Eight hundred B.C. You could put in

328
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,820
Assyrian study as T.E.L.E., which is just a stone carving column. Right. I forgot the king.

329
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:42,300
He's wearing what they call a Maltese cross because it was an astronomical. Jason Brashears

330
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:48,000
talks about the Phoenix event that reoccurs. That's in other literature. That's called the

331
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,280
crossing the Great Crossing, because all of our celestial events tend to be from east to west.

332
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,600
Right. The what's called the ecliptic. And every hundred and thirty eight years, according to

333
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,180
Brashears, which seems pretty valid, it's you could back it up. There is an event that happens

334
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,860
where the object goes from north to south and it actually goes between the moon and the earth. So

335
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,280
it's pretty close and it's pretty big. So it wreaks a lot of havoc. So that was called the crossing.

336
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,940
I found out about that in the 80s when I was reading stuff about the flat earth. I had a

337
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,340
roommate and we rented a lot of the space that we were renting out of it actually to people that

338
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,300
were just traveling through New York City and just needed to stay for a few days here and there.

339
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,080
And we ended up making more. We're like, how are we going to afford this? So we'll just rent out

340
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,440
some of these rooms. We actually made more than we were paying for rent by rent. Right.

341
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,700
Right. Yeah. A lot of interesting people passing through and upstairs and below us and above us

342
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,540
are some interesting people. And they were really big into flat earth. We're talking about

343
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,520
nineteen eighty four and eighty five and eighty six. All I heard was flat earth, this concave

344
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,920
earth and this and that. And this that's this phenomenon here. Right. Reincarnation, this and

345
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:06,400
that. And make sure you die. Make sure you die. Conan Buddhism. Right. All this other stuff. So

346
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,740
all the stuff that you hear coming back again. Right. Because there was a big boom in that in

347
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,360
the eighteen hundreds, in the 1920s, 1880s, New Age movement again, boomed. And then again now.

348
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,220
Right. Yeah. They talk about that in the hollow earth as well.

349
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,660
The hollow earth also that we live inside of a hollow earth and we're actually concave,

350
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,420
not convex. And so I studied all that stuff. And the flat earth made a lot of sense when I

351
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,360
we live in a simulation made a lot of sense because someone saw an admin. I was getting

352
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,560
architectural magazines at the time and there was an ad in there for a while. There was a

353
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,580
big, big building boom in the 1980s and especially in Manhattan. And they were short on anyone and

354
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:55,220
anything in building trades. And they needed surveyors. And they say, you take this 10 day

355
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,740
course and you get twenty five bucks an hour. Now, twenty five bucks an hour in the eighties

356
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:06,300
is like seventy five bucks an hour now. Right. Maybe more. Right. So, yeah, I mean, you know,

357
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,840
anyway, yeah, like gasoline was barely a dollar and, you know, whatever, you know,

358
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,420
anybody who was alive then can vouch for him saying, I don't know the exact exchange,

359
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,000
but it's at least three to one. It could be as much as five to one now.

360
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,220
So anyway, I was like, oh, this sounds like fun. And I took the surveying course and we could not

361
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,260
plot a triangle on the earth if we got more than a quarter of a mile or a half a mile,

362
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,500
especially a mile apart. You could not make the three points close and have one hundred and eighty

363
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,100
degrees. Never. Which and we couldn't figure out why. Just because the earth is, you know,

364
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:49,660
got curvature. Right. But again, with the flat earth, I have seen that out on Blythe, which is

365
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,180
near the border of California and Arizona. I've personally witnessed someone who was a feed

366
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:03,560
feedstock farmer. He grew the stuff they feed animals with, right. All kinds of fine greens

367
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:09,340
and things like that. And he had quite a few acres and they have these ditches that irrigate

368
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,660
right in California. They're like part government and own part private owned rights. And these

369
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,160
ditches were they were so flat, but they had such a slight decline that you couldn't see the water

370
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,920
really moving. It was they looked completely flat. They only had like a one eighth of an inch every

371
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,460
20 feet. That's all they had to pitch. They had. And that went on for miles. So

372
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,540
only like several miles, even some of them were 10 miles long. It looked completely flat,

373
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,900
but the water flowed in one direction. Now, I'm wondering, is that flowing up the curvature or

374
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,720
down the curvature or are they taking account for the curvature? Because I remember surveying.

375
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,200
I couldn't we couldn't close the triangle because of it. Right. And he's like, oh,

376
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,200
doesn't matter. We do it like the earth is flat. And I'm like, oh, interesting. Now,

377
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,600
when you go to architecture and you're building and you're, let's say, floating a cement road,

378
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,160
concrete road, you float that thing only for water drainage. But otherwise you float it

379
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,800
dead level. You don't account for the curvature of the earth no matter how far you go.

380
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,980
And also you have something called a plumb bob, you know, vertical plumb when you're building a

381
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,179
skyscraper or whatever. And it's totally perpendicular to the level and there's

382
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,719
no accounting for the curvature of the earth either. So I was like, wait a second. With

383
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,719
certain things we can prove the earth is got curvature and other things we can prove the

384
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,100
earth is flat. So what's going on? Not until I started Greeks because like, wait a second,

385
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,739
you know, they have like the law of attraction, which is not true and all that stuff. But your

386
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,159
intent, you know, you can actually create your own reality, right? We do create our own reality. So

387
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,440
if you're working in the in your farmer, so an astronomer can prove to you that the earth is going

388
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,320
around the sun and the moon, right? And all this stuff go around the sun, all the plants go around

389
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,820
the sun. Yes. But if you're a farmer, you can prove that the sun goes around the earth. If

390
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,860
you're farming, right? Because you're on your land with all your crops and up comes the sun in the

391
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,560
east and it goes across the ecliptic more towards the north in the summer and more towards the south

392
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,540
in the winter. And the moon does the opposite. And that's it. And if you start if you're a farmer

393
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,560
and you start trying to make adjustments for the earth going around the sun, you're not going to do

394
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,360
very well. Right? So in some cases, you have some trades or activities that you're involved in,

395
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,980
you have to take an account for the earth being quote, unquote, a globe. And other things that

396
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,840
you want to get involved in, you must take account and rely that the earth is dead flat.

397
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,780
So which is it? Neither. It's what you intend to do. You take account for all the surrounding

398
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,400
energies and forces. That's why I guess it was good to start off with a sharp blade, wasn't it?

399
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,300
Yeah, it was. I mean, look, even a long range sniper has explained to me that he has to account

400
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,820
for the curvature of the earth, which is probably like a like a surveyor, because

401
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,200
surveyor, you're looking through what's called a theodolite. And, you know, that ray of light or

402
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,520
that amount of light is not point source, but it's enough to travel straight and discernance. Yeah.

403
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,080
Right. Depending on the sniper. Also, I think even more because snipers have callers. Also,

404
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,300
they have people with them that do wind speed and distance. Right. Yeah. Spotter. Now they're

405
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,080
a spotter. Yeah. And there are scopes that are that are complex enough to do that. But I don't

406
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,480
know a spotter. So they will give all those adjustments. They have a chart just like

407
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,920
a heavy artillery. Exactly. Exactly.
