1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,740
69, just because I want to say that up front, okay, there you go.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,040
I got to be childish for a moment.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,700
Why not?

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,420
I feel childish because I'm on a planet, I think, full of children, in a way, anyway,

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,700
Greek, how are you tonight?

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,180
How's your time going?

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,159
From a lascivious point of view, we used to say Muff Divers Union Local 69.

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:31,960
That's it.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,280
But anyway.

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:32,980
That's it.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,600
But then again, what is it, the mid-90s or so, I guess I noticed that Muff Diving became

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,000
an endangered sport because, you know, things change.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:41,980
Whatever.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,120
Actually, they don't.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,300
There's many things that, what is it, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, right?

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,060
There isn't.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,100
No, it doesn't exist.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,620
It's a way to take advantage of the continuing genocide program.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,020
What happened with it, by the way, we're not going to talk about this tonight, but I'll

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,160
just bring this up again as a refresher, that there have been genocide programs, you know,

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,740
the Native Americans in the U.S., and at the same time, you know, every 50 years all over

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,620
the world, there's a genocide program, you know, the Armenian-Greek genocide, the genocides

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,420
during World War II, and then after that in Cambodia, right, with Bopat.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,200
And, yeah, so what's happened with genocide, this is a sonic on its own, really, and I

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,700
could bring up more on it because I've been watching it since the 80s when it was really

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,680
hitting on the retrospective perspective.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,680
Oh, yeah, and it knows no boundaries because, I mean, you had the Tutsis and the Hutsis

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,500
or whatever over there in, you know, Rwanda, you had that, you had...

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,400
Sort of, yeah, they just go to villages, cut people's arms off.

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,620
But what happened in the 80s, they retrospected all these genocidal things that were going

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,520
on, but what they took it, they took the nationality, ethnicity, and culture nationality out of

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,920
it, and they just made it now it's across the board, all humans are subject to genocide

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,100
through medical assassination, I call it.

34
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,780
So in short, what they did was they came up with a variation of something called a test,

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,800
which is totally random, an AIDS test.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,820
It's also been used on the COVID stuff, the same test, right, but with a variation.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,140
And supposedly it counts certain, basically, pus in the blood, right, which you can increase

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,560
by eating raw meat or certain food preservatives.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,660
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of their alleged tests that, quite honestly, you can throw

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,900
them off by eating too rare a piece of meat and you'll come up positive for a whole bunch

41
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,160
of them.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,780
Yeah, I told anyone that if you want to test positive on an AIDS test, just eat a rare

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,340
hamburger, especially, and you'll test positive on it.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,820
But they don't, this is what I found out even later, they don't even run these tests.

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,700
I mean, they batch them and it's just random, you know, it's random, like the lottery.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,540
But a bloody rare steak, I mean, you could literally turn up with anything from colon

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,480
cancer to AIDS on the various trips if they run them.

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,560
If they run them, but they didn't, actually, because there were so many people doing it

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,240
and so many few that were equipped to do the test, which they knew didn't work anyway.

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,500
Just like most DNA testing doesn't show much.

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,100
But what happened was the propaganda machine was already set up.

52
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,200
So anyone who tested positive or not, but usually positive, they got bombarded.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,320
See, they in order in order to get the test, they want your contact information.

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,820
So now that they have your contact information, they barrage people with propaganda that,

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,360
you know, you have been potentially all presumptive language that people take as a fact

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,440
that the language went like you potentially have something that might be a very serious

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,400
disease. You have potentially tested positive.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Never, you know, they never say you tested for anything, but the presumptive language.

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,640
But when people take it as fact, so they keep barraging you should consider treatment.

60
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,620
But I don't have any symptoms.

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,980
Well, that's it'll be too late if you have symptoms.

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,100
You should try the treatment before you have symptoms.

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,720
Right. Well, guess what happened?

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,620
The drugs that are being used, I can I remember I did have all the technical breakdown on

65
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,380
this, by the way, they do. It's easy to find.

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,320
Well, I don't know about now. You're talking about the AZT and all that, which is a

67
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,820
hormone. There was a guy that you might have interviewed also that supposedly died of

68
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,300
tooth abscess. He was he wrote a book called Official Stories for Officials Only or

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,340
something. In fact, yes, he was a good friend of mine, Liam Sheff, Liam Sheff.

70
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,600
Yeah, I think they he died of a toothache.

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,820
Basically, I think he was getting a little too close to being popular on what he was

72
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,740
saying, which was very unpopular, which was that AIDS didn't exist at all.

73
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,980
No, it doesn't. It's the drugs that cause it.

74
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,260
People went out and the mechanism.

75
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,100
Yeah, people went after him very badly.

76
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,360
He didn't die of a toothache, actually.

77
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,060
But but what happened is he went to the dentist and then suddenly you I did not know you

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,520
knew that story. Yeah, he had an infection and it got worse and his ears exploded

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,740
internally or something.

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,080
Did you know? Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,860
I had spoken to him a couple of times.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah, I was introduced to him on the by Vinny Eastwood and I broke it down and he was

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
just amazed that I knew about the inner workings of it.

84
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,360
He says, you're from New York, right?

85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,600
This is. Yeah, I could basically says I could tell a slight accent.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,980
I'm like, oh, that sucks, man.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't tell me you could tell a slight accent from New York.

88
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,400
That's not good. It's very anyway.

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,920
It's very, very subtle with you.

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,180
Very, very subtle. But the thing I mean, you know, with me, it's like you can tell him

91
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,240
from Jersey, Jersey.

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,520
Yeah, of course. If you watch any Pesci or you watch any Jack Nicholson or you watch

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,980
any of this, you watch The Sopranos.

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,060
You know what it is. It's exactly like one of those guys.

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,180
No, I'm totally not aware that you were because I was actually the last person to

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,020
speak to him publicly.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,520
And I knew he technically speaking, he took his own life.

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,300
Great. Oh, OK.

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,740
Well, I could see that from pain, right?

100
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,400
Or discomfort. Or, yes, all of the above.

101
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,360
And what happened is after he went to the wow, I've never talked to a dentist.

102
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,240
He went to a dentist and he yeah, there was such a horrible ringing in his ears

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,400
afterwards that it started driving him crazy.

104
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,620
He could not stop it.

105
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,400
And then there were too many problems in his head.

106
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
And he said, you know what, I don't want to be here anymore.

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
Yeah, that's the typical microwave weapon, by the way.

108
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,060
It just cooks a little bit of the brain, cooks a little bit of the body.

109
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,860
And the ringing that is very typical of radioactive radioactivity, by the way.

110
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,400
Well, that's what if you used to be I did look at a study back in the library back

111
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,460
in the 80s and 90s of what if you die of radioactive poisoning, there's several

112
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,420
we're talking about just the melanomas and the skin manifestations getting irradiated

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,440
from the inside. There's like major things.

114
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,760
But the typical ones was, you know, like severe pneumonia, severe diarrhea

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,360
and ringing in the ears, tinnitus.

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,560
But it was beyond tinnitus, you know.

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,860
Right. Well, Liam, really bizarre.

118
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,380
I did not know that that story was publicly or it was known by very many people

119
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,540
outside of myself and his partner at the time.

120
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,280
No, I kept looking him up because he was the only other person drawing attention to

121
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,820
this that I knew of in public.

122
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,620
Well, that's when they actually started to go after him.

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,760
You know, he touched on every other, you know, conspiracy, whatever, conspiracy in

124
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
the culture of medicine.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,020
It was fine. Yeah. Food, medicine, all that was fine, fine, fine.

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,300
And when he really wrote extensively about the the charade of AIDS, that's.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,100
Yeah. Well, he got impressed that I knew this because he he never got into it.

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,940
He thought that people would just lose it.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,940
I said it was very simple.

130
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,520
It's called epithelial apoptosis.

131
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
It's a thing in the body that, you know, your cells, you know, they say you're in

132
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,940
all the cells replacing your body every seven years.

133
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Well, there are cells, especially like in the cheek and the nose and in the colon

134
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,020
that replace every day.

135
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,680
And that's epithelial cells.

136
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,740
And when they replace they and they grow back, they they release a small hormone to

137
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,140
let the body know that, hey, we've grown back.

138
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,860
So what all he was was a synthetic form of that hormone.

139
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,040
And all you got to do is give it to someone.

140
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,440
And when they have the natural epithelial apoptosis cells falling off, that hormone

141
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,940
says that the cells have grown back, but they haven't.

142
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,020
So that natural process of cells falling off don't get most of them don't grow back

143
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,780
because you're bathing and your blood is full of this hormone that says that they've

144
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,559
grown back. Right.

145
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,179
So then you get these fat tumors and or some people get these big lumps and fat

146
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,480
tumors and die of toxicity.

147
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,520
Others look like they're the concentration camp, you know, on the food when you fast

148
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,980
for, you know, whatever, you know, yeah, not eating starvation diet like one of the

149
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,840
starvation. Yep.

150
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,360
And sores all over and pneumonia because the lungs are very sensitive to this.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
So and that's what it was.

152
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,100
There's a person died of AIDS because test of AIDS.

153
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,140
Everybody applauds and goes and thanks the doctors for all their help.

154
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,100
And no one, I assure you this, no one positively, absolutely no one has died of

155
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,540
AIDS that put it this way.

156
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,600
No one positively, without a doubt, anyone who has tested positive for AIDS, doesn't

157
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,100
matter how many times that did not receive treatment, died from AIDS.

158
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,080
No one. Only the people that receive treatment that, of course, didn't have symptoms

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,200
because there is no symptoms.

160
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,700
Right. See, so there is a level of where is.

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,060
So it's a big distraction.

162
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,500
So, you know, how many doctors and scientists and politicians and regulatory people know

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,860
what I just said? Thousands.

164
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Where is the outrage?

165
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,460
Why aren't these people being pulled out of their homes in the middle of the night?

166
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,700
Right. And arrested and taken.

167
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,840
Right. Why isn't this made public?

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,880
Well, because that's just the way it's supposed to be.

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,480
You're almost you're almost saying verbatim what Liam said.

170
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,980
OK, you the both of you are you're you're actually like seriously, like this is exactly

171
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,120
the speech that he would give to me off air on air didn't matter.

172
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,420
And he absolutely he talked to me and said, you know what, it's liver dysfunction.

173
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,440
And it all that stuff you just described with the epithelial cells and the the problem

174
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,620
with the toxin. It's all liver.

175
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,900
It's all liver. Yeah.

176
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,420
Yeah. By the way, by the way, the liver loves coffee.

177
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,140
I've been trying to kill myself with drinking a gallon of coffee for the past 15 years.

178
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,880
It's not working. And I have a hard liver whenever I go to typically when I was bike

179
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,920
racing and get massage.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,900
Your liver's real hard. I said, oh, yeah, I'll just finish myself off by drinking coffee

181
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,820
because I'm a speed. I'm an upper kind of guy.

182
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,680
Right. Right. So I'm drinking.

183
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,720
I still drink coffee.

184
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,080
My liver is doing great. Thank you.

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,740
I'm doing great. You know, you don't have such a great you got a bum liver, but, you

186
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,020
know, I'm doing great for the coffee, but it taxes other parts.

187
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,480
So anyway, what I'm trying to say is that anything you take, especially if you look

188
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,860
at the big diabetes epidemic, is no such thing.

189
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,020
Go look up anyone.

190
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,400
Do a search on why my blood sugar tests are not accurate.

191
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
They'll tell you it's because you're either dehydrated or you just drank a bunch of

192
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,960
water because there is no such thing as blood sugar.

193
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,800
There is a blood glucose derivative that appears can be measured directly.

194
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,180
If you had sugar in your blood, you'd be dead, by the way.

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,920
Right. Just like these other things.

196
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,620
Right. So it's a derivative, you know, like, for example, when you work in the oil and

197
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,500
gas, there's something sulfur hydroxide.

198
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,020
It's a rotten, rotten egg smell.

199
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,800
Right. Yeah.

200
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
And it's it's in comes up.

201
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,780
But when it gets to a toxic level, it becomes odorless.

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:50,020
Imagine because really, logically, you'd say, well, the stronger the the rotten egg

203
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,420
smell from the natural crude means it's getting worse.

204
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,500
We should get out of here. No.

205
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,500
What happens is smells like rotten eggs.

206
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,080
And when it gets to a lethal dose level, it goes completely odorless.

207
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,040
So you don't even know. Right.

208
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,580
You see, it's very lethal that way.

209
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,740
Right. So and there's no they have no way of measuring this gas directly, but they

210
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,020
know it reacts with other gases.

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,660
So when they see this reaction happening with other gases, they say there's a lethal

212
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,220
presence. That's what the meters, how the meters work.

213
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,700
There's no way to measure it directly, just like there's no way to measure blood

214
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,920
glucose levels directly.

215
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,340
You see, it's an indirect measurement and it's based on liver function.

216
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,740
That's why when you're thirsty, OK, you've heard this many years when the football

217
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,640
coach at high school, everybody's thirsty.

218
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,740
They run off the field. He says, drink just a little bit of water.

219
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't drink a lot. Right.

220
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,280
Don't guzzle. When you're an athlete, you don't want to you just want to sip a

221
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,080
little bit of water no matter how thirsty you are.

222
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,460
So you don't put your liver in shock.

223
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,840
But in Asian, by the way, medicine, the pancreas are not considered an organ.

224
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,000
They're an adjunct to the liver.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,660
They're not considered a separate organ.

226
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,880
Right. You know, it's a grouping.

227
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,080
You know, the kidneys are the liver is, you know, the stomach.

228
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,140
But the pancreas are not they're not considered just like the ancient Egypt.

229
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,260
They didn't mummify the brain.

230
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,260
They had didn't consider it to have any value.

231
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,180
Right. So it's part of it.

232
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,220
So anyway, all this stuff that they're putting on people is exactly what the

233
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,580
it's the same mindset.

234
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
So where is the outrage?

235
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,380
And there is no outrage because that's look, this is what I wanted to really talk

236
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,560
about tonight. You asked maybe about time.

237
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,720
Yeah, I'll tie this.

238
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,060
I did. But hold on a second, because this ties directly to something else.

239
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,120
Just really quickly.

240
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,980
The only thing that I have noticed people agreeing on as of late.

241
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,920
Right. And it's very strange.

242
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,920
It's very subtle, is that if you if you get people that have some level of

243
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,020
outrage that are upset about what's happening, they

244
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,400
all only seem to agree on one thing.

245
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,460
And that is that we are dealing with a massive culling here.

246
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,080
That there is no.

247
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,680
But I disagree because you when you say culling.

248
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,180
But I'm not asking you to agree.

249
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm telling you what I'm noting from the general population, OK, is that they

250
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,700
are saying that they feel as though the entire

251
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,300
group that is humanity is basically eligible.

252
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,680
Now, this is not.

253
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah, yeah. Well, I agree with that.

254
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,980
That's what the AIDS was about before.

255
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,860
It was nationality, race or whatever.

256
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,080
More beefs. Yeah.

257
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,520
Now it's a beef with everyone.

258
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,700
Right. That's that's the odd thing that is just starting to emerge

259
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,000
in the consciousness.

260
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,540
I see. I don't know how to explain that.

261
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,620
But it's it's so wild that you bring up, Liam.

262
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm sorry. I knew Liam before I knew you.

263
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,860
And I wasn't aware that you knew him, you know, because he was very compartmentalized

264
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,280
with who he spoke to and stuff.

265
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,400
I messaged him a little bit. He was just impressed that I knew about the, you know,

266
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,600
the epithelial, how the drug I was targeted because most people.

267
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,400
Oh, right. Here, let me just lead off to another thing real quick, another tangent

268
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,620
here. It's not really a tangent, but it is when when AIDS

269
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,860
came up in the 80s, I remember in New York City they were putting up these

270
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,040
bills, you know, like posters at night saying, oh, AIDS is created in a

271
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,780
government lab. Right.

272
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,800
That's right. So people think it's still real.

273
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,680
It's another diversion. So when they do something like 9-11, COVID or AIDS

274
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,980
or diabetes or whatever, actually, they haven't done much.

275
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,400
But what they do is they have the event, they have the official story, then they

276
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,860
actually put out a few alternative stories to mislead you.

277
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,840
Right. Well, that's where they came up with the whole the guy had sex with a

278
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,720
monkey thing. Yeah, exactly.

279
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,600
Same people that they put that out.

280
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,040
So the people that don't say, well, if the government says it's this or the

281
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
officials, it can't be that it must be the monkeys.

282
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,300
So they divert just like 9-11.

283
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,320
It's a one on one textbook nuclear demolition.

284
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,720
You could watch a hundred videos on Project Plowshare.

285
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,660
It's identical, the mechanism and everything.

286
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,420
The react surface reactions and all that.

287
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,940
But they say, oh, you got Judy Woods and these other people, not to mention

288
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,840
names, say that it's space weapons or

289
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,680
or the idiots who put dynamite on each floor.

290
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh, my gosh. You know, so they put out the same thing.

291
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
But it's it goes on and on and on.

292
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,760
But here's the thing about the to go back to what I was saying.

293
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,420
Whatever you say about people, most of the people on the planet are backdrop.

294
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, when you're going to create a realistic simulation or a situation

295
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,520
in art, whether it's theater, film, what have you, you need a backdrop.

296
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,580
Right. So the backdrop is the place and it's also the people.

297
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,140
So I assure you, it could even be your husband, your wife, your children, your

298
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,460
parents. They're not real.

299
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,880
There are very few real people, meaning people that have a level of development

300
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,460
that can actually function as what a human can be defined as.

301
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,260
That's a mouthful. Most people are backdrops.

302
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,240
And I would suggest that the amount of people that are real is getting to the one

303
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
in ten thousand, one in a thousand.

304
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,160
So you can you can actually go out and meet a hundred people and ten could be real

305
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
people. You can go out and meet five thousand people.

306
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,220
Only one would be real. It's not an even spread, you know, but you're not going to

307
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,340
meet real, very rare.

308
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
It's getting more rare, more people.

309
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,440
So no matter what, again, people thinking this and people believing that there's

310
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
still the backdrop people.

311
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,780
Right. You get it.

312
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,319
So now this is where I wanted to go with this on time.

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,859
You said, well, let's talk about time.

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,200
Well, how many times have you heard me say on the airy, fairy new age?

315
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,420
There is no time. They're correct.

316
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,460
But if you ask them why there's no time, they can't tell you.

317
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,680
Just like a Christian, you're being saved.

318
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,060
Saved from what? They don't know.

319
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,180
Right. Right.

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,580
Time is mainly the recordation of events.

321
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,820
That's all it is. So if you have no record of time, like you're not going back and

322
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,160
memorializing, which means either digitally or writing it down or drawing a wall, a

323
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,220
picture on a wall of an event that happened with a time marker, astronomical or made up

324
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,340
calendar, there is no time.

325
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,580
Correct. The time that you experience during the day, whether you had a long day or

326
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,160
short day, that is also variable.

327
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
Right. How many times you heard if you're busy, the day goes by fast.

328
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,880
If you're in a waiting room all day, it feels like you were there for a week.

329
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
I experience it all the time.

330
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,200
Yeah, experience. It's purely the event.

331
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,180
So but what I'm trying to say is for those that are real humans, you will notice

332
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,300
that especially in the past five years, regular chores and things that you did, whether

333
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,540
it was laundry, cleaning the house, washing the car, going to work, something, the

334
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:23,020
normal stuff that didn't that is taking longer and longer and longer to do and

335
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,060
becoming more of an arduous task.

336
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,000
You'll notice that what I've hypothecated till now and I actually voiced it

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,320
yesterday was that we're basically here.

338
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,760
They're the real humans to waste your time.

339
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,940
Basically, is it a waste of time?

340
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,660
No. But what it is, it's stretching, stretching out your life, things that you can

341
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,480
accomplish in a couple of years, stretching it out to take 70 years.

342
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,240
Right. OK.

343
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,880
Stuff that perfect example would be the education system in America.

344
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
They have kindergarten through 12th grade, right?

345
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,520
K through 12. Let's just call it one through 12.

346
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,080
It's when you look, you're in school from fall to spring.

347
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,460
You take summer off basically in the morning, the three or seven to two.

348
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,180
When you add up all that, it's a thousand hours a year.

349
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,900
So it's 12000 hours to go from K to 12 or first to 12th grade.

350
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,280
Right. By the way, college is also in grade.

351
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,700
So you're your next four years in college means you are 16th grade, right?

352
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,320
Graduate level, 18th grade, 20th grade is PhD.

353
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,100
Yeah. OK. That still works that way.

354
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,000
If you go look at government records, what great if you look at someone's government

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,460
file. Greek, how do you know this?

356
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,980
OK, that's another story.

357
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,660
If you have a bachelor's degree, it says you went to the 16th grade.

358
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Right. So anyway, it's commercial grading, right?

359
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,900
Like grade A, grade B, whatever.

360
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,140
OK, so what's happening is if you look at the 12000 hours of education, I can

361
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,940
personally teach someone to exceed that in less than 300 hours.

362
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,560
I can teach what they teach in 12000 hours or anyone can do it.

363
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,800
All you need is 300 hours of that 12000 hours to get the equivalent of what they

364
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,880
write. So they're stretching out their time.

365
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,340
Most people, they call them NPCs.

366
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,240
I do agree with that. They're non-player characters.

367
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,400
You'll see them. They gravitate towards they don't question anything.

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,380
They complain when the rest of them complain.

369
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
Right. They're like on a hive kind of thing.

370
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,920
And they do the sports.

371
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
They do the job, you know, this, that and the other.

372
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,440
And they procreate. And out of the procreation of the NPCs, they could they can

373
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
have a real person.

374
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,440
Like, for example, my parents are NPCs.

375
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,660
Right. To most of the degree.

376
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
Most of the people that I've met and had relationships are NPCs.

377
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,460
Most. So where does that put me?

378
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,740
Well, how can you parents be an NPC Greek and you're not?

379
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,900
Well, maybe I am an NPC.

380
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,740
It's up to you to decide. You think where it fits.

381
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,800
So what I'm saying, it's a mixed bag of stuff.

382
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,540
It's very much how you can have everyone in the family.

383
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,660
He's got brown eyes and brown hair.

384
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,140
But suddenly, little Joey, he's got blonde hair and blue eyes.

385
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
How'd that happen? Well, way back.

386
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,640
There's you should go back in the log pile.

387
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,120
You'll see that your great uncle was like that.

388
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,400
Right. So the gene just happened to emerge at that point.

389
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,020
Very similar.

390
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,800
The recessive gene, they call it.

391
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,200
Sure. Whatever.

392
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,240
Yeah. Whatever name they put to it.

393
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,900
I have very low credence in the science.

394
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,000
So what I'm trying to say is like, think of life as a bubble.

395
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,260
They have these bubble things.

396
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,960
You know, you buy soap with a little ring and you blow these little bubbles

397
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,760
and they have the more deluxe kit and it's a bigger bubble blower.

398
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,320
And then they have the ones where, you know, the showman, you know,

399
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,280
you hire clowns or whatever at a birthday party.

400
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,060
They have these big loops and they have a big cookie sheet when they put the soap

401
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,380
and they blow this big bubble. It's like three feet long.

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,060
You've seen them, right?

403
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,240
But they're all bubbles and they pop just the same.

404
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,980
So your life here on this incarnation is like this soap bubble.

405
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,160
And it's a long soap bubble.

406
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,220
Unless you try to be like a little bubble

407
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,920
and you just sit in there with the collective shows to do.

408
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,420
What I've noticed is

409
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,320
almost from a retrospective

410
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,480
recapitulation of looking back at all this stuff.

411
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,720
It's like, you know, you get a lot of woulda, coulda, shouldas.

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,400
I have no regret ever because I've processed what that is, you know,

413
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,260
and you always learn you learn more from mistakes and misgivings

414
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,400
than you do from everything being smooth. Right.

415
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,500
So that's why actually people with a college education are not revered

416
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,400
as much as those that have experience in the same field. Why?

417
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,180
Because you're going to learn more.

418
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,280
No, you learn more because you learn because you've actually seen

419
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,860
more screw ups in the field. Right.

420
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,920
It's not because you actually see the experience shows you more script.

421
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,240
So they know how not to do it.

422
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,220
If you learn, the thing is, if you can learn from the scripts,

423
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,780
that's where it's really, really is.

424
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,500
What I've noticed is that everything that I've done in my life,

425
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm almost approaching 60 in my sixth decade already.

426
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm going to be 60 soon.

427
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,740
Is that everything that I've accomplished and all of it

428
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,000
could have been done in less than 15 years.

429
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,760
But not that I've accomplished anything noteworthy.

430
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,640
I'm just saying that anything that I have achieved and learned from,

431
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
I could have done if I compressed my life down to being a 15 year old,

432
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,320
I could have achieved this, which means that

433
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,740
I could have done it all in just a few years,

434
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,840
because you really don't have a lot of liberty until you get to 12, 13, 14, 15.

435
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,160
Anyway, right. Right. Actually, 18 years old.

436
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,020
You're not allowed to participate in many things. Right.

437
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,940
But back in the days when I was growing up,

438
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,280
I mean, I pretty much did everything by 15 years old.

439
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Yes, everything. Now, you know what I anyway.

440
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,680
So gotcha. Yeah, everything.

441
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,320
So I've done everything that I need. Yeah. OK, so.

442
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,920
So if you break it down to that, my entire life,

443
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,240
I could have experienced in one year if we lived in a real world

444
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,500
where things were encouraged.

445
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,340
Like, give me an example.

446
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,140
Well, I'm going fast tonight and I haven't even had any coffee.

447
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,960
Well, I have coffee, but I'm not drinking as much as I usually do.

448
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,080
But here, maybe it's the fresh air.

449
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,900
This is the thing.

450
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,920
The. How do you say this?

451
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,100
It's really hard to explain, but I'll just give more of a description.

452
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,540
So the element of time.

453
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,480
Is is not is not the what's recorded, but how the quality of the event.

454
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,980
So in essence, let me just sum up everything I said.

455
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,160
I actually feel like I'm a 15 year old

456
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,220
because I have the experiences of a 15 year old up to this point.

457
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,660
I have not. I have not done a lot.

458
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,980
And actually, I have done more than most people several lifetimes have.

459
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,260
Right. I get I discuss people that have worked in heavy industry

460
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,720
and ask me, well, where do you work?

461
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,560
I never worked in heavy.

462
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,920
How do you know so much about heavy industry?

463
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,420
I talk to a cardiologist.

464
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,480
He says, where's your residency?

465
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,420
I know he's like you sound like a cardiologist.

466
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,540
I speak to an attorney.

467
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,700
Where where are you practicing?

468
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,620
I never you see.

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,960
So it's like catch me if you can.

470
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,920
I can sit with many, many, many disciplines and discuss the

471
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,240
that discipline as if I've been working in it for many decades.

472
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,500
And I haven't.

473
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,380
And I feel like I have the experience of a 15 year old.

474
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,200
Why? Because we live in this artificial kind of

475
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,440
stretch elastic kind of reality

476
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,600
where where here's an example.

477
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Have you ever heard of someone discovering a process, a device or something

478
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,120
and other people don't want to know about it or use it?

479
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,340
And you almost have to convince them, you know, convince others

480
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,580
to get involved or use what's actually good for them.

481
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,500
Could you imagine that?

482
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,860
What kind of a retarded situation is that?

483
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,780
Right. Yeah, I've heard of that. Sure.

484
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,340
Yeah. Imagine having to convince someone just do this.

485
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,260
It'll be better for you.

486
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,040
And they don't want to.

487
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,360
And you have to actually convince what when a real reality,

488
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,180
all you would have to do is make them aware and acknowledge it.

489
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,160
And then they would naturally see that as the better alternative.

490
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,780
We should, of course, we should do this.

491
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,300
Right. So the level of resistance that is put here.

492
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,780
In other words,

493
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,900
for to to blow a big soap bubble, you have to have a lot of resistance

494
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,320
for that to happen, right?

495
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,460
Because if there's not any resistance, the bubble won't form. Right.

496
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,640
You have to have equal amount of resistance on both sides of the bubble. Right.

497
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,900
Right. So the temperature changes and all that, you know,

498
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,620
make it easy to pop in the surface tension and all that.

499
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,180
So we live in this thing where if you recapitulate on your life,

500
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,480
think back of everything that you've done, you'll notice it's not continuous.

501
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,360
It's just certain events that you try to latch onto and copy

502
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,060
in these big segments of time in between. Right.

503
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,640
If you were to, you know, put someone in a room and write down

504
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,900
everything you've done in your life in the next three hours,

505
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,840
you'll see there are big gaps between certain events.

506
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,860
You might concentrate most of the in a few years.

507
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,360
And there's a huge gap. Why?

508
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,260
Because it's it's this we live in this distorted, perceptive thing,

509
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,620
almost like the Mayans said we live or the Aborigines.

510
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,300
We live in the dream world where this is not real.

511
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,720
That's why some people have dreams that are more realistic than being here.

512
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,140
Right. Right. So I still don't have a handle on fully what's going on.

513
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,760
But when something is brought forth

514
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,680
or to me or to anyone, I would suggest try to learn a little bit about its history

515
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,420
and how and how others perceive it, if it's different from how you perceive it.

516
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,400
So if you go somewhere, for example, everyone says this is the way we do things.

517
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,040
But to you, it doesn't feel right.

518
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,920
You should look into it.

519
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,260
Just don't jump in and do it because everyone else is doing it.

520
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,940
You know, trust that feeling, which is more than the gut.

521
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,100
Right. It's the heart. Right.

522
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,840
So once you start looking at that and now, believe it or not,

523
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,020
it's getting even harder to find stuff.

524
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,100
You can't go to a good you can't find a good library to find reference materials

525
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,240
anymore on, you know, good things, things that were memorialized

526
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
and kept in good record form.

527
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,920
So what I've discovered and I was thinking and talking about this yesterday

528
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,320
is that it's just like a soap bubble.

529
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,420
You've got different sizes and you've got these big, you know, tricks up soap bubbles.

530
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,980
You might have seen a member of Washington Square Park in Manhattan.

531
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,400
You'd have these carnival guys going on, blow these eight foot long soap bubbles,

532
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,400
you know? Yes. Yeah.

533
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,780
So that's what it's like.

534
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,600
It's very fragile and and whatever.

535
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
And it's stretched out.

536
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,640
And just to go back to how I started this

537
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,800
is anyone who is a real human.

538
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,860
Just try to recall your basic chores that you do.

539
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,840
Right. And how how it felt a few years ago and how it feels now

540
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,400
and how it's like just drudgery now. Right.

541
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,800
And I've talked to several people that are real.

542
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,820
And it's like, you know, notice things are just stretched out,

543
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
you know, and harder and harder to do. Right.

544
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,220
So some people would describe this to me as you just in a holding pattern

545
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,060
for a while, like you're waiting, waiting room, the waiting room.

546
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,460
There you go. Yeah.

547
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,980
We talked about the waiting room from back in the days.

548
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,260
Hello, Robin, if you're listening.

549
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,920
I don't know if you're around anymore, but she started a small blog,

550
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,140
a little window thing called The Waiting Room a long time ago.

551
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,720
One of the early, early Greek speak stuff in 2015, I think.

552
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,680
Yes. Back in the time you were talking about the closing credits

553
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,620
were just in the waiting room waiting for the. Yeah.

554
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,200
It's stretching. So the whole thing is, you know, to say, have fun.

555
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,980
Daniel Ramirez said, like, have fun, guys.

556
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,160
Remember, it's always said, have fun, have fun, have fun.

557
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,180
And don't be nervous.

558
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,520
Or he'd give you a slight dinner from American Freedom Radio.

559
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,120
He's a good guy.

560
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,000
And regardless.

561
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,580
And he would just say, yeah, he'd give you some criticism.

562
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,540
Use this mic or that. Don't worry about that.

563
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,600
Have fun. Have fun. Have fun.

564
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,680
He kind of that's the message. Right. Really?

565
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,520
You know. Right. Just.

566
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,280
And yes, having fun at the expense of others sometimes.

567
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,040
Yeah. You might have to do that sometimes.

568
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,300
It depends on how serious you are about having fun.

569
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,300
Kind of like the the the simplified message of, you know, what is

570
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,360
what is the meaning of life? It is to live.

571
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,100
Yeah, it's just life. It is the meaning.

572
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,080
It's it's it's an all inclusive package.

573
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,680
It works. It works out well in the end.
