1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,640
Sonic event number 7, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y.

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,300
Not even sure if I need to announce that every time because you're subscribed here so you

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,780
got it and you know what you got, or maybe you don't, we'll see.

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,100
Meanwhile, we ended off the last event, Sonic event number 6, discussing briefly a bit about

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,480
well what is a naturally occurring disease.

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,480
The Greek mentioned a few things there really of interest that I don't know, we need to

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,040
get into it a bit more but there's quite a bit that has come up in the chat which we

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,180
do have toward the bottom of the page if you're on the Sonic event page and this interaction

9
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,640
is interesting so I'm going to try and touch on some of those subjects that were brought

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,820
up there as well as other feedback we've gotten but anyway, Greek, how are you doing today?

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,880
Hey, what I'm doing, no natural diseases here.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,220
You know what, I got kind of sarcastic on that about being natural about drinking too much

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,360
alcohol and your liver rotting off, right?

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,980
Or your groin rotting off if you're too promiscuous.

15
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,300
When you hear me make comments like that, it means it's for another time and I just

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,280
want to leave off with a strong visual, you know?

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,320
Mental image there, definitely strong if you're thinking of, I don't know man, the whole crotch

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,440
rotting off thing was a bit much in my head but hey, whatever.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,820
Natural causes, what's natural, suicide, whatever they call these days, the suiciding, two bullets

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,060
in the head or he hung himself and then shot himself in the head with a rifle, you know?

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,200
Yeah, well you know the guys that shoot themselves in the chest twice with bolt action rifles,

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,280
yeah, that's always interesting, I got to say.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,880
You know what they're doing there, they're accommodating the idiocy of the public.

24
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,940
Here's the thing we might have touched on, you don't deal with the, if you see the media

25
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,960
as it is, it's not rational, it's not logical.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,820
So you cannot deal with someone who has abandoned all rationale and logic in that form.

27
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,920
You have to deal with them as a crazy person or the way you would look up protocols for

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,860
dealing with the insane and there's a lot of it, I'm not going to get into it, a lot

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,060
of the protocols just basically arresting them and confining them, right?

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:41,360
So until what is served to the masses, those purveyors are, you know, let's say confined

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,660
and eliminated, it's going to continue.

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,040
But it's not their fault, they're simply accommodating the public.

33
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,380
So in essence when you see ridiculous stuff being put out into public, that's what the

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,100
public wants.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,440
It's the same reason why you open a service station, a gas station, a convenience store

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,720
on the side of the highway, let's say I-10 or 95 in the middle of the desert, right?

37
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,000
Why?

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,820
Because you got a quarter of a million cars or 100,000 cars passing every day, right?

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,300
So if the people stop traveling, that highway closes, what happens to that convenience store?

40
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,400
It closes too.

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,440
So you have this highway of what's called the collective, the mainstream, the normal,

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,260
that they're just accommodating.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,140
So I tell people, stop giving any energy to what's being put out to the public unless

44
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,080
it's for you, you know, and the same goes with disease.

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,340
You know, that's one of the common themes that I bring up often at every turn, actually,

46
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,020
any presentation I give where I say, you know, the reason why, when you want to complain

47
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,340
about, here we go with the why again, you want to complain about the quality of the

48
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,480
information you're getting, the truth is that it's there to accommodate a waiting audience.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,720
You know, there's a waiting audience that wants this, that wants to be lied to, that

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,280
wants to be misdirected, that wants to be told the ludicrous.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
It is what they want.

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
Yeah, so the media, the purveyors are not the problem.

53
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,500
Yeah.

54
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,760
No, you can't sell something without a ready and waiting customer base.

55
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,100
You just can't.

56
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah.

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
They're fulfilling a demand.

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Right.

59
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,100
Fulfilling a demand.

60
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
That's a better way to put it.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720
It's an unspoken demand, because if you ask these normies, and when I say normies, it

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
could be someone you're living with, it could be your wife, your husband, your children,

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,240
your parents, your neighbor, people at work, it could be anyone around you, so don't get

64
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,880
upset at them.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,140
It just happens to be they were just cut from that cloth.

66
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,880
They won't admit it, that that's what they want, but you know, that's what they want.

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
That is what they want.

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,820
Now, it's fascinating, because one of the things that came up in the chat, I think ties

69
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,620
directly to this, because you mentioned fake terrorist attacks, you mentioned fake pandemic,

70
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,740
and I agree with you there, because not as advertised, any of it, of course, just like

71
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,740
the so-called vaccination, not as advertised over and over again, but look, I don't want

72
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,120
to go into that necessarily, because the question was asked in the chat, is it not time for

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,420
the Project Bluebeam kind of stuff, right?

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,540
Is it time for that?

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,420
Now, I often wonder this, and I know a lot of other people do, because we've heard about

76
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,760
the theories of, well, okay, the fake alien invasion, that'll come, right?

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
Some people have talked about that.

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,460
Well, that could possibly unify humanity, because we would all see a common enemy, and maybe

79
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,980
come together and realize, hey, look, we're actually all on one ship together here, this

80
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,100
rock, this planet, this place, right?

81
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,620
We're all in one place together.

82
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,780
Nobody's gone to Mars yet that I know of, at least not in recent times, so, you know,

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
I mean, we could talk about ancient history, maybe at another point.

84
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,100
If there is a Mars, as advertised.

85
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,120
As advertised, there you go.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,140
But, I mean, the fact is, we're all here, right?

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,060
I mean, this we could say, we're on this one particular astral body.

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,680
Let's call it world.

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,840
Okay, we're on this one world together.

90
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,520
So could this be a unifying thing if there was an alien invasion, whether it was real

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,600
or fabricated, a complete Hollywood production?

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,820
People have also brought up the 30-story tall Jesus, you know, showing up maybe in a major

93
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,400
city to make a declaration that's being projected out there as a giant hologram.

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,680
Again, all the Project Blue Beam type fantasies, which, it's not a fantasy, there were people

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,500
working on these things, and the possibility and the concept, and as I've tried to explain

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,080
over and over again, think of anything ridiculous, somebody has gamed it out.

97
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,460
Somebody has come up with a contingency plan.

98
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,320
Somebody has come up with strategies for it, but what about that?

99
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,100
Is it time for that kind of thing?

100
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,000
Would that be part of the equation?

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,940
I mean, we've already got other productions here with footage and witnesses and victims

102
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:02,260
and everything else, one way or another, fake pandemic, fake everything else, why not an

103
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,940
alien invasion?

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,220
Okay, let's do, okay, let's go to, use 9-11 as a, let's say, an explicit model.

105
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,060
Most people call it a terror event, but the whole thing was hinged on hijacking, right?

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,960
Airplanes, right?

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,660
Yeah.

108
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,900
Even the missile that hit the Pentagon was called an airplane, okay.

109
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,740
So this was reoccurring since, I remember growing up in the 70s, and there was always

110
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,400
a joke about the Cuban hijackers on an American plane saying, take this plane to Cuba, was

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,740
a joke.

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,320
I don't know if you remember stuff like that.

113
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,540
Oh, well, that wasn't just a joke.

114
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
They were trying to popularize.

115
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,780
Yeah, no, they were trying to popularize that, and also Middle Eastern terrorism, too, because

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,300
there were hijackings from what I could see on television, anyway.

117
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, the real, there were more, actually, there were more real hijackings than ever

118
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,780
been advertised because they used Israeli Mossad forces who were trained to stop it,

119
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,520
and there's a, long story made short, I worked with someone, pretty famous architect now,

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,020
back in the 80s, and his girlfriend's mom worked for the CIA in that department.

121
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,940
Anywhere in the world where there was a hijacking, they were able to deploy several teams within

122
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:20,560
a few hours, and once they got into the airplane, it took about 15 seconds to arrest the situation,

123
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,820
to take control of the plane.

124
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,260
That's never been shown in Hollywood, by the way.

125
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,720
It wouldn't make a good movie, right?

126
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,840
Well, no, because they showed us Dirty Harry going onto a plane, right, and dressing in

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,500
the captain's uniform, and of course, people's imaginations was sort of captured by the Dan

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,720
or D.B. Cooper narrative in the early 70s, so again, this is the kind of thing that was

129
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,700
already sort of injected in the culture as, well, as you and I were growing up, I think

130
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,520
you're maybe a touch older than me, but either way, still, we were kids at some point in

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,500
the 1970s and 80s, so there you have it.

132
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,420
This was part of the cultural memes of the time.

133
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,460
I know there weren't memes yet, because there was no internet, well, not for us yet.

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
But they were memes, nonetheless.

135
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,900
Right, exactly.

136
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,920
So you know what I'm saying.

137
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,860
It was there, but different.

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,220
Go ahead.

139
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, but the hijacking thing was not mentioned.

140
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,040
It's called terror, right?

141
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,040
So, okay, so it kind of sat latent for a long time, and then 9-11 happened.

142
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,540
If you examine the gaming of that, it was about hijacking, but we don't really view

143
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,160
it as a society as that, right?

144
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,460
It's just this fear concept.

145
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,720
The alien invasion's going to be very similar.

146
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,760
So if it's in the popular mind as a meme, as it has been for the past few years, it's

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
not going to happen soon.

148
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,620
But just like 9-11, it has to serve multiple functions.

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,060
I can give you a very strong, educated speculation.

150
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,920
Once the Middle East, let me just cut to the chase, the important part first, in case we

151
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,960
run out of battery, right?

152
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,200
I always tell people, give the important part first.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,760
When you're having a discussion, you should always preface, inform, and then discuss.

154
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,440
Here's the preface and the information.

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,680
When the Middle East Union comes about, and everything's focused there, and it turns into

156
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,120
a jihad-type situation, that's the time to do it.

157
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,780
So you're going to have this, in other words, it won't be to some people, it'll be aliens

158
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,360
to other people, it'll be Mohammed to other people, it'll be the J-E-S-U-S to other people,

159
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
it'll be Elijah to, you see what I mean?

160
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,540
Okay?

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
So it'll be like that.

162
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:34,700
But I know I could tell you another educated guess, that if you do see on television, flying

163
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,800
saucers shooting a beam to the ground and everything vaporizing and turning to dust,

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,620
including people, that's what you'll see on TV.

165
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,160
But if you're in place and you have a cell phone, by the way, now, if you take a film,

166
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,480
especially with an Apple phone, a video of something that you shouldn't have, you'll

167
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,060
go back and replay the video and it won't be there or it'll be different, right?

168
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,680
This technology exists.

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,540
So let's say you record it with your iPhone, what you see on TV is a spaceship or a saucer

170
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,220
or something shooting down to the ground, vaporizing everything and everyone on the ground.

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,700
When you're there, you won't see a ship at all, you'll just see the ground shaking and

172
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,780
vaporizing everything on the surface, because they'll be using underground nukes, right?

173
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,020
But it's very convincing that if you see it on TV, they're going to insert whatever, something

174
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,660
aerial, the same thing in 9-11.

175
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,660
By the way, just a little tidbit, if an airplane, if you study airplane crashes, by the way,

176
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,240
the moment, the moment, doesn't matter what speed it is, especially in flight, the moment

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:49,080
the nose of a plane up to the pilot's cockpit touches or hits something, a wall, it's a

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,460
phenomenon, you could study this if you like, the tail rudder in the tail section falls

179
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,060
off automatically, because the force is longitudinal, it moves to the back and then moves back and

180
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,320
forth like a standing wave.

181
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,840
So you could watch planes crashing into things and the tail falls off right away.

182
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,800
So if 9-11 really was a plane, what you would see, no matter how fast it's going, as the

183
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,340
nose, the front part of the plane fuselage before the wings made contact with the building,

184
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,580
the tail would have fallen off completely, right?

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,420
I know it sounds kind of crazy, but that's how physics works in the real world.

186
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,740
Yeah, it kind of makes sense to me in that it might create a pressure pocket, so to speak,

187
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,920
that would push back and might, yeah, actually push.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Well, you could look at, study every legitimate plane crash.

189
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,160
You may not see plane parts, but you'll definitely see the tail and the tail rudder on every

190
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
occasion.

191
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,340
I've seen them hit a runway.

192
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,100
The plane could be completely disintegrated.

193
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,640
Yeah, I've seen them hit a runway and they do that, you know, where they burst into flames

194
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,100
and all that.

195
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,060
I actually watched a bunch of those crashes that they, you know how they filmed a bunch

196
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,320
of crashes to study them?

197
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,240
You know, the FAA did this for a while, they filmed a whole bunch, I don't know if they

198
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,800
do it anymore.

199
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,380
You won't find, well, you won't, it'll be hard to find, but yeah.

200
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,220
Used to be, though.

201
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
They used to be online.

202
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,120
Yeah.

203
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,720
Go ahead.

204
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,020
Sorry.

205
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,300
No, that's fine.

206
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,200
That's just a phenomenon.

207
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,040
It's basically what happens is it's a longitudinal force.

208
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,920
In other words, the moment the front of the plane gets crushed, it instantly reacts to

209
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,500
the back, right?

210
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Because it's being, you know how sound moves at 700 miles per hour through air and moves

211
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,380
six times faster in the water and 20 times faster on a steel railroad track.

212
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
You know, the Native Americans used to put their ear to the railroad tracks and hear

213
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,940
the trains from 30 miles away instantly, right?

214
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,560
So it's a phenomenon like that.

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,260
It's, yeah, it's very interesting when, you know, if you get into all of the real physical

216
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,640
aspects.

217
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,320
By the way, the nuclear hypothesis on the World Trade Center can easily be, you could

218
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,600
see the foreshadowing of it by just going into YouTube, put in Project Plowshare and

219
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,980
just study the videos up there.

220
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,220
You know, there's about 10 or 20 videos and it's just like a World Trade Center disaster.

221
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,860
You won't see tall skyscrapers being vaporized, but they're all underground tests.

222
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,900
So that'll be interesting.

223
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
By the way, I just want to throw something in.

224
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,740
You know, the cigarette smoke causes cancer.

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,740
Cigarettes cause cancer is another bogus thing here since we brought up disease and

226
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,220
all that.

227
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,820
People were getting in the U.S., downwind or east of Nevada, lung cancer in the late

228
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,100
60s and 70s.

229
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,260
Everyone was pretty much that had weak lungs or whatever.

230
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,300
That's because of all the aerial, the nuclear testing, the ionized particles were going

231
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,940
into the air and people were breathing it.

232
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,360
And when the particles got into your ears or your lungs, they were irradiating you day

233
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,720
and night.

234
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,360
It's the same as like getting eight hours worth of x-rays every day.

235
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,560
Of course, you're going to get cancer.

236
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,000
But cigarette, the statistics on cigarette smoking causing cancer is still, lung cancer,

237
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,020
for example, can easily be looked at, but 85% of the people that ever get lung cancer

238
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,660
even today have never smoked.

239
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,860
85% of that 85% are black and Jewish women because what actually causes lung cancer these

240
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,100
days is grief.

241
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,980
Do you think black and Jewish women have a reason to have grief?

242
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,420
I mean, based on their culture, right?

243
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,440
I mean, I'm just saying this, you know, it's just a way to look at it.

244
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,920
So I just wanted to throw that in because when you say nuclear, it's a multi-multi-multifaceted.

245
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,960
It would be, imagine cell phone technology as it is now was not released to the public

246
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,560
and we were still using rotary dial or push button dial with corded phones.

247
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,980
But the technology was up to it, whereas it is now, but hidden from the public.

248
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,260
That's what's going on with the nuclear technology.

249
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,420
It's extremely developed, but if you bring this up to anyone in public, they just still

250
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,800
think of the world, you know, the Hiroshima, Nagasaki bombs with the big flash and the boom

251
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,680
and all that, and they don't think that's evolved from that point.

252
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,920
During the Bosnian War in Serbia, when they had a ceasefire, there were still rogue colonels

253
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,140
and generals out in the field, and they got upset when their cell phone stopped working.

254
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,380
So here's your new cell phone.

255
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,640
The guy powers it up, hits a few buttons, and it leaves a 40-foot diameter by 30-foot

256
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
deep crater.

257
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,860
And of course, there's a bright flash that could be seen from 20 miles away, right?

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,540
In normal, right?

259
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,740
You get my point?

260
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,600
Yeah, I got you.

261
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,700
Yeah, this was in the mid-90s, they were that small.

262
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,860
So the alien invasion, if it's overplayed, like let's just go back to what you were saying,

263
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,680
being up young in the 70s and 80s, the whole thing about Cubans hijacking planes and saying,

264
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,460
take this plane to Cuba was a little overdone as a meme, you know, it was very much in

265
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,060
the public light, very much so.

266
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,060
But it never turned out that way, you know, ultimately.

267
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,280
So the Project Blue Beam isn't going to happen that way.

268
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,599
All the Project Blue Beam stuff is fine, it's being gamed, but ultimately it's what you

269
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,540
see on TV.

270
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,640
They don't even have to, you know, here, if you go back to 9-11, they still say those

271
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,579
planes were holograms.

272
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,319
There's no one in New York saw any plane.

273
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,599
Now obviously they have, what they do is when you work for an intelligence agency and retire,

274
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,740
you know how they say you never really retire, they call on you while you're in retirement,

275
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,340
and they say you'll get 30 grand if you put on a Con Edison or, you know, New York City

276
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:34,000
power and water hat and get in the truck and start driving around tomorrow and tell people

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,800
you saw a plane.

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
Sounds very convincing, right?

279
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,140
It's very simple.

280
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,640
By the way, what you never hear about 9-11 also is all the people that were getting hit

281
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,760
over the head and their cameras taken on the street.

282
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,760
You don't hear about that very much, right?

283
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,080
I know of someone who this had happened to.

284
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,180
So, well, it was with someone who this had happened to.

285
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,660
There were people driving around and on foot saying, hey, you got a camera, come here,

286
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,540
come here, come here, and they just take the camera, smash it or hit you on the head if

287
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,280
you don't give it up.

288
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,880
Hundreds.

289
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll tell you something.

290
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,800
I think this is a pretty good piece of advice and you could tell me otherwise, but in fact,

291
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,240
I think that some people should go and get the old technology for a camcorder, even if

292
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,640
they go get like a DVD camcorder or a tape camcorder, if they want to actually record

293
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,340
events and be able to preserve them, I think they'd be better off with the DVD one, probably.

294
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,660
Here, there's two problems with that.

295
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,100
One is carrying that thing and you never know when it's going to come.

296
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,640
Maybe it'll be foreshadowed because I remember about a week before 9-11 coming, I was doing

297
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,880
some mural work for someone who comes from a copper mine family and I was saying, be

298
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,900
careful, they're going to pull something with this Osama bin Laden guy and I kind of talked

299
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,500
about it.

300
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,440
Like, you know, hey, look, it's 9-11.

301
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:43,920
Get it?

302
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
9-11, 9-11 is coming.

303
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,160
Emergency, emergency, you know?

304
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,600
I knew something was wrong when CNN, the government was looking for Osama bin Laden, but CNN was

305
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
able to hold an interview with him, right?

306
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,740
So this alleged government, I talked about that.

307
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,480
It's in receivership, you know, the ice cream shop that went out of business but still open

308
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
in business somehow?

309
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:04,940
Oh, yeah.

310
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay.

311
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,640
So, yeah.

312
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,180
So, there is no Project Blue Beam that will be put into effect because all they have to

313
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,100
do is show it on TV and they don't even have to use really great technology.

314
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,120
Everyone will believe it.

315
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,040
Those that actually witnessed nothing aerial, nothing in the sky, no flying saucer will

316
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,520
second doubt themselves because of the trauma, right?

317
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,480
I mean, if you feel the ground shake and everything turns to dust in front of you, including people

318
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,880
standing there, you're going to be like, yeah, maybe I did miss the saucer, you know?

319
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,260
You see what I mean?

320
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,800
And this is how gullible people are if they still want to be attached to their friends

321
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,640
and family, right?

322
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,260
Well, that's the other thing is that, look, if you show a burning building on TV and you

323
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,800
say a bomb was dropped on the building, people are going to go with the idea that the bomb

324
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,720
was dropped on the building.

325
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,480
All they actually saw was a burning building, right?

326
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,860
I mean, this has been done before.

327
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,660
Well, that was done, you know, the military is for hire.

328
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,920
They shot a missile up near San Francisco area to take out a woman that was Obama's enemy

329
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,480
or whatever.

330
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,140
And they said it was a gas line explosion.

331
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,040
You actually one of the TV crews got there too soon and he could see the gas company

332
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,900
with trailers unloading old gas pipes, throwing them on the street, right?

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,580
It's people in the area witnessed a low flying jet and they heard a whiz and a bang.

334
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:33,580
So, I mean, also there was the guy who the reporter, I don't recall his name, talked

335
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,880
bad about Obama and his car exploded in the Mercedes, right?

336
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,660
That was pretty popular.

337
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,780
There's a few of them like that.

338
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
So it's pretty out in the open.

339
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,600
No one really cares.

340
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,600
And I don't think you should care either.

341
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,580
Just protect yourself.

342
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, meaning you, whoever's listening, just be this is the type of world you're

343
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,180
living in. But essentially, the alien invasion is going to be very simple.

344
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,540
People are overhyping it and overcomplicating it.

345
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,140
It's just what's shown on TV.

346
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,220
You know, that's it, period.

347
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,880
I mean, but if you're going to leave a footprint or make events happen, yeah, they're

348
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,480
going to have small underground nukes and sewers and buildings and places like that.

349
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,880
And when they go off, yeah, they may look pretty unreal and unnatural.

350
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,580
It would be very plausible that it would be an alien invasion.

351
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,120
But I don't see it happening now.

352
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,700
It has to be it has to serve several reasons.

353
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,900
And the only dynamic that I see coming or something like that will serve multiple

354
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,940
purposes when the Middle East starts becoming the center again.

355
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,220
Well, again, meaning thousands of years, but the center of attention in a conflicting

356
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,780
kind of way. So if you're going to have a

357
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,060
public alien invasion, it's going to be there.

358
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,540
But doesn't mean that they're not going to go to like Washington State or the Midwest

359
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,320
or Florida and say the spaceships flew over here, too.

360
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,020
Right. But it won't be until the Middle East thinks that starts getting hot and

361
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,240
popping. You know what I mean?

362
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,740
Right. And look, in previous Sonics, we talked about the Middle East, Middle Eastern

363
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,540
Union and stuff like that, which I never could quite follow exactly how that was

364
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,520
going to go. We

365
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,340
talked about what was it, Israel, Syria as well.

366
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,320
Well, when you see Iraq separate as a country and a new country is formed in

367
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,840
northern Iraq, which takes parts of Syria and parts of Turkey, which, by the way,

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
Syria has been softened for the past eight years.

369
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,300
I mean, before the Syria thing happened, the fake revolution there and all this

370
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,760
stuff going on with Turkey, with the Kurds, the Kurdish people, no one really talks

371
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,180
about their their own people, their descendants of the Persians.

372
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,180
You're going to have a new country. Well, if that, let's say, formed in a week or so,

373
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,720
we are on it's hot and popping here in a couple of weeks.

374
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,000
Right. Once that starts.

375
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,920
But that's one of the signs.

376
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,960
But the another sign that you're going to see is conflict in and around Israel.

377
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,880
It'll be a typical of, you know, when the security apparatus is removed before an

378
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,120
assassination assassination takes place.

379
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,340
OK, this is typical.

380
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,040
You're going to see politicians in Europe, in Israel and generals and military key

381
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,780
people be out of the country and there will be an invasion on Israel.

382
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,720
But this time they're going to be subdued.

383
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,720
Right. And if you are in the Israeli military, you will witness insubordination

384
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,740
because you'll be given orders to do things that are clearly suicidal or you'll

385
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,200
be attacked and be told to keep your arms down.

386
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,860
You know, don't fire back.

387
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,640
Really dumb, really dumb, dumb stuff.

388
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,340
So if you're in the in the IDF or in the Israeli military, be prepared for

389
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,420
ridiculous orders like literally, you know, having even infantry or air coming over

390
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,760
you and being told to to not fire back at all.

391
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,400
Right. You know what I mean?

392
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,280
This this is the kind of overt, you know, basically the leadership, meaning the

393
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,460
world leadership and the leadership in Israel is going to give up the country.

394
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,240
Well, you know, what forces?

395
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,180
Yeah. Watching some atypical news feeds recently, actually, I'm seeing some

396
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,660
reports about protests and things in Israel and the military actually starting

397
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,920
to not be as cooperative as they once were.

398
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,400
People not, you know, because you have a compulsory service there.

399
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Right. If you're supposed to claim citizenship, you have to go and serve for a

400
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
bit. You know about this.

401
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,260
Well, apparently there are some, you know, for the first time ever.

402
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,820
Refusing to to to comply.

403
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,280
Something is happening there.

404
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,080
And I'm not sure all of what it is.

405
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,860
It's difficult, you know, because there's not a lot of reporting on it.

406
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,040
But that's starting to happen.

407
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,660
Do you think that that's the that that is a beginning signal like right now that

408
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,680
we're going to see the beginning signal started more than let's say quite before

409
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,060
that, with the political system being overtly in shambles.

410
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,120
But yeah, what I meant about the military reaction is they're going to be basically

411
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,100
told to stand down no matter what happens.

412
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,880
And the only defense they will put up, any Israeli military will put up are those

413
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,940
that are not following orders.

414
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm just saying as a general thing, they'll be told to stand down, which won't

415
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,400
make any sense at all.

416
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,400
And this will make it out once once this happens, which is actually pretty soon.

417
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,200
I either see it this fall or next year in the spring.

418
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,920
Don't hold me to that because I don't really see much of that happening till 2025.

419
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,320
But I could see more of a signaling.

420
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,300
But essentially, let's just make it simple instead of just watching what's in the

421
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,980
news and like trying to read into it when it starts.

422
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,140
The military of Israel will be told to stand down on the only fighting back or

423
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,020
fighting. Defending will be those that are not taking orders or not following those

424
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,660
orders, which is going to put it into even more confusion.

425
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:57,480
And so, yeah, I was speaking with someone from Israel recently and I said, basically

426
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,580
the conversation ended up.

427
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,820
So just watch the news when you see like all the Knesset and major figures out of

428
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,340
the country. It could get hot and popping real soon.

429
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,620
So it's pretty, pretty.

430
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,720
Look at the basic stuff.

431
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,980
Don't very often.

432
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,700
I've been looking at the Middle East in detail and you get pretty, pretty wild

433
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,280
about and start reading in things, you know, and I just sit back and just look at

434
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,560
the major stories because the time we're not at that time or near that time yet.

435
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,100
We're close to it. So so that's what I have to say about the alien invasion.

436
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,900
It's going to be centered in and around that part of the world when it gets moving.

437
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,140
So I wouldn't I wouldn't be concerned at all with the holograms and blue beam and

438
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,380
everything. They don't have to do that.

439
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,540
That's that's pretty simple.

440
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Well, it won't be necessary, but like you said, they can broadcast a variety of

441
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,560
things. And like I said, they could also show you the burning building and tell you

442
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,660
why it happened afterwards.

443
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,260
Right. Here's the aftermath of what this occurred that occurred.

444
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,880
Here's some witnesses, whether they're real or not.

445
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,660
And there there you have it.

446
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,480
That's what that's what happened, because that's what the TV show says.

447
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,940
Right. Well, yeah, even when they're real witnesses, they edit out and they put it

448
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,460
together how you want to how they want it to see that there is nothing real about the

449
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,440
TV other than the perception that people that receive it think is real.

450
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,240
And, you know, so it's pretty far gone, but it's always been far gone.

451
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,600
And if you look at periodicals, which are it's getting harder and harder to find.

452
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,340
But in the 19th century, even the 18th century, they're basically saying we have a

453
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,320
problem with the news, you know, basically don't read, don't read them, don't believe

454
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,600
what's in the newspapers. It's trash from the seventeen hundreds, eighteen hundreds,

455
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,740
early nineteen hundreds. But there's always been a movement, but that hasn't

456
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,340
changed. Right. There was a big movement in the eighteen hundreds, you know, what's

457
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,460
going on with the media. It's all they called it yellow journalism at the time.

458
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,240
Right. Did it did it change in the 20th century or now?

459
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,360
It didn't have no effect.

460
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,540
No. Even when they first started making the newsreels, the films and all that, they

461
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,040
were staging that and they kept getting caught, you know, doing that where it's like,

462
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,780
oh, we're showing you a film of the invasion that nobody knew was supposed to happen.

463
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,220
You know, and it turned out it was all choreographed and better than what Hollywood

464
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,380
was putting out. So well, the the War Department was their secret.

465
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,680
It was the Laurel Canyon.

466
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,840
That's right. The famous Laurel Canyon in Hollywood, L.A.

467
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,220
That's where they met and brainstormed a lot of stuff.

468
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,240
So I want to go back to the natural disease.

469
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,620
Yeah, absolutely. Because, you know, and again, I want to integrate something from

470
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,140
the chat room one more time, because, you know, people did ask about

471
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,720
treatment of animals in a way.

472
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,280
Somebody asked about pets.

473
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,700
There was a couple of different discussions.

474
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,700
And I always find this interesting because, again, the the, you know, the pandemic

475
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,860
narrative, right? What was going on?

476
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,440
People were eating animals they shouldn't be eating, right?

477
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,140
The wet market. Remember that whole thing?

478
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,260
The. Oh, is it a penguin?

479
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,580
Or remember there was maybe it's a bat, maybe monkeys, monkey.

480
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah. I mean, squid.

481
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,260
So look, there are real consequences to eating the wrong things.

482
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,000
OK, there just are.

483
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,440
But some of them are practical considerations, but there's more to it than that.

484
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,760
So, you know, what about the stewardship of the animals?

485
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,940
I mean, I'm sorry to go to the very pedestrian biblical text here, but, you know, it

486
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,860
doesn't have to be biblical.

487
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,000
You'll find it everywhere as far as, you know, Vedic means knowledge.

488
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,420
Right. Right. And they basically considered killing anything as murder.

489
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,760
Right. So you can take it again.

490
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,680
What's right is what wrong is what covenant you live by.

491
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,800
If you lived, let's say, in a Polynesia where they still have cannibals, if you're at a

492
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,500
birthday party, you'd be fighting on who's going to eat the eyeball of a human.

493
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Right. Which is I'm taking that from, by the way, when they roast lamb at a wedding in the

494
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,100
Middle East or in Europe, southern Mediterranean rim, the people fight who's going to

495
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,940
eat the eyeball. You know, it's a pun on that.

496
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,180
So so here's the thing.

497
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,860
Right or wrong is right or wrong within the agreement or covenant that you have.

498
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,460
Right. You know, if you get caught with pot, marijuana or weed in Malaysia, it's death

499
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,440
penalty. Right.

500
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,160
But here it's legal.

501
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,140
So supposedly they're called covenants.

502
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,420
Right. We're laws and rules.

503
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,660
So it depends on where you live.

504
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,680
It's geographic to a certain degree here in most of the Western world.

505
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,340
You pretty much pick how you want to live, what rules you live by, you know.

506
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
So, you know, the biblical one is easy.

507
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,160
Four legged has to four legged animal, cloven hoof.

508
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,320
Choose the cut. It's clean and clean, meaning it is spirit.

509
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,300
Your spirit. It's spiritually allowable.

510
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,600
Like it would be halal in which means permissible in Arabic or haram is not permissible

511
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,940
in Hebrew.

512
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,200
We call to me, which is not unclean or kosher, which means fit and proper.

513
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,640
Right. So what's fit and proper is the way to look at it.

514
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,240
And but anything you any animal meat, if you cook it to death, if you've known anyone

515
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,580
who's been a world traveler, if you're going to eat meat somewhere, you just have them

516
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,480
cook it to death, meaning cook it till it's really dead and then cook it again.

517
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,920
Right. Char broiled almost to the point where it's totally dry protein, then you'll

518
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,980
pretty much be safe, you know, change most of the energy where it won't harm you, even

519
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,980
human food. By the way, what's what covenant you live by?

520
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,840
I could tell you, I just live by the Old Testament covenant, covenant of what to eat.

521
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,460
You know, like I mean, we were sharing pictures of pizza, Chuck, and you showed me one

522
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,740
where that looked like pork sausage.

523
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,700
I didn't comment. I said it just looked good.

524
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:41,840
But, you know, you learn a lot about people by what they show you, what they eat, what

525
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,960
covenant they live by. Right.

526
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,480
Because if you were living by an Old Testament covenant, you wouldn't have that.

527
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,160
I'm presuming it was pork sausage.

528
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,000
No, actually wrong.

529
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,260
Sorry. It was beef.

530
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,500
But that's OK. OK, but I'm presuming.

531
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,300
No, I sliced up some meatballs and they were, you know, beef as far as I know.

532
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,560
OK, definitely beef and overcooked, like you said.

533
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,600
OK, there you go. That's fine.

534
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,920
Meatball should be rare anyway.

535
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,560
So here's the point. It's who am I to tell what covenant to live by?

536
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,540
Because, by the way, there is no conversion.

537
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,940
You know how the Christians have missionaries and convert people.

538
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,380
And if you weren't Catholic or Muslim, you paid a tax in the back in the old days or

539
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,860
whatever. Even today, if you're in the registered public media in Europe, you see

540
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,240
something out against the Vatican.

541
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
It's a 5000 euro fine.

542
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,440
Right. So either way, there are other covenants are forced on people.

543
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,260
You know, fortunately and unfortunately, here we have a legal system which is all

544
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,400
presumptive, which I do want to touch on again a little bit because I was recently

545
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,500
reading a court doc from someone I know and he lost the case.

546
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,460
But the case he lost because of something that wasn't even part of the case.

547
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,600
So I was like, oh, my gosh.

548
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,620
And so anyway, here's the it's all presumption.

549
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,320
So the thing about animals is this again, if you go back to the Old Testament, any

550
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,060
time you touch the flesh of an animal, you're spiritually unclean until the next

551
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,300
day you wash and then you're spiritually clean again.

552
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,460
Next day starts at noon.

553
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,620
Right. Because it's not sundown like the, quote unquote, Jewish people think.

554
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,680
Because if you're in if you've ever been in the desert, if you wash your clothes

555
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,640
and hang it up to dry at night, you know, the desert, you could have a 40 degree

556
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,400
temperature drop when the sun goes down.

557
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Right. It's very cold.

558
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,420
Yeah. Yeah, it can be.

559
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,620
So but if you're living in a desert climate and you and you wash your clothes at

560
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,320
eleven o'clock, you hang it up at eleven fifteen, you put them back on, they're dry

561
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,960
pretty much. So whatever, you know, you who am I to tell people?

562
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,080
I could just tell people what I found out and what I could hold to be true

563
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,100
mathematically, you know, like two plus two equals four and four minus two equals

564
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,040
two. You know, it runs it runs both ways.

565
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,620
So here's the thing. The biblical text tells you if you touch meat of any animal,

566
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,760
you're unclean. Right.

567
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,220
Spiritually. Well, let me ask you, if you bring up what animal is OK to eat?

568
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,100
I'm saying spiritually. Right.

569
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,140
Because you could get to death even if it's human.

570
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,720
You can eat it. Right. So here's the thing.

571
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,500
What animals is properly or ultimately it indirectly tells you if you touch flesh,

572
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,800
you're unclean. So let me ask you, if your chicken is allowable, let's say beef.

573
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,080
OK. When you're eating a meatball sandwich, it's all beef.

574
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,159
Are you touching the flesh of an animal?

575
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,219
Yes or no. Very simply. Of course you are.

576
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,520
Of course you touch. If you're not, you know, you may not you might be so good.

577
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,300
It doesn't even touch your teeth when you eat it.

578
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,699
You know what I mean? You just. Right.

579
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:33,400
So, yeah. So what what I'm saying is the biblical covenant indirectly promotes

580
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,580
vegetarianism indirectly without telling you that.

581
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,860
Right. To be a vegetarian.

582
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,800
So there you go. There's a lot of people that I've spoken to that are not doing

583
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,739
well financially. And I talk about clean foods.

584
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,179
I can't afford to eat clean.

585
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,820
What do you mean you can't afford to eat clean?

586
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,500
Actually, the best food you can eat are high quality grains and legumes, which are

587
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,520
all cheaper than meat.

588
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,380
So, you know, so if you run into someone who says I can't afford to eat proper

589
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,700
food, they could win the lottery the next day.

590
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,140
They're going to go to, you know, still eat junk food.

591
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,680
It has nothing to do with what you can afford or not afford, you know.

592
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,620
So it's a state of mind. There's an excuse for everything.

593
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,580
I would suggest that on the other side, if you don't eat clean and know about it

594
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:21,140
and you still eat pork products, I assure you up to 10 percent of all the pork

595
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,180
you've eaten, if you've been eating pork since the 1980s is human, human flesh

596
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,540
ground up in there for several reasons.

597
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,720
It's a pranking.

598
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,880
You know what I mean? Like they say, let's put some human in there and they're

599
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,960
still going to eat it. Right.

600
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,860
And look at them. You know, it's just another way to, you know, point that the

601
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,480
those that eat it right now, by the way, when you get into Illuminati, high end,

602
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,780
whatever, whatever, whatever, secret society stuff, they that's they use.

603
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,860
They know that the stuff that I'm talking about here with biblical stuff, that's

604
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,660
what they follow, by the way, even when they do a human sacrifice, by the way.

605
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,520
So there is no there is no right or wrong on this.

606
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,180
But I will tell people very often Greek, you know, what about this?

607
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,840
I can't say it's wrong, but I'll definitely tell you it ain't right.

608
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,700
Right. That means it's a moral issue.

609
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,860
It's an ethical issue.

610
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,880
And again, I don't know how to stress this.

611
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,080
If you eat pork products, I assure you, you you've eaten let's say you eat you've

612
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,280
eaten 10 pounds of pork products in the past 10 years.

613
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,940
One pound of that is human flesh.

614
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,260
If you're listening to me or know someone that's still are you OK?

615
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,660
Yeah, most likely you are.

616
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,480
Right. You see, this is the condition you're in right now, by the way, make no

617
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,040
bones about it. It's pretty much out in the open.

618
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,200
Pepsi, Doritos, Frito Lay, they tell you they put aborted fetus tissue in their

619
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,400
food for flavor. It's pretty open.

620
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,860
It's pretty well known. It's actually more than that, more than those two

621
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,880
companies. Yeah, I found that totally bizarre.

622
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,340
Like, what would be the purpose of adding that to a soft drink?

623
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,300
I don't spiritual, spiritual purpose.

624
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,280
The same with the vaccines.

625
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,840
Like I look, I don't talk since if you knew me in the 80s and you asked me to

626
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,360
talk about vaccines now and you took a transcript of what I say now about

627
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,560
vaccines and you took a transcript of what I said in the 1980s about vaccines

628
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,040
and you held the two transcripts up in the light, they would be identical.

629
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,200
I'd be saying exactly the same thing.

630
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,600
So, I mean, don't you get a little tired after a while?

631
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,120
There is no such thing as a vaccine.

632
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,600
You cannot inject because there's you don't have an immune system.

633
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,800
I think I went over that. No one has an immune system.

634
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,520
No one has diabetes.

635
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,520
There's no such thing as blood sugar test.

636
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,000
By the way, people who take blood sugar, by the way, you know, the pancreas,

637
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,480
which is sole cause of diabetes, supposedly do not exist as an organ on their own.

638
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,500
It's like saying you only need one wheel on your car.

639
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,260
The pancreas are part of the liver function, period.

640
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,880
Right. You know, Asian medicine does not consider the pancreas as a separate thing.

641
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,140
It's part of the liver. When you take a blood sugar test, that is purely based on

642
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,860
hydration. Liver takes about three or four.

643
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,340
When you're thirsty, all you need is three ounces to four ounces of water.

644
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,480
You take more than that. Your liver can doesn't do deal much with it, just sits there

645
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,980
for later. So this is very well known, by the way.

646
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,220
You could research it on your own if you're thirsty or dehydrated or you drink water.

647
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,500
It changes the blood sugar.

648
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,160
You know, the little prick, the dot, the blood sugar thing has nothing to do with blood

649
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,540
sugar, has to do with hydration levels and the way your liver is functioning.

650
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,020
They, you know, so we got 50 million people that are diabetic, type one, type two, that's

651
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,040
liver function, purely liver function.

652
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,140
The liver. Yeah.

653
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,500
Oh, you know, when you give chocolate to a dog, it's bad because the liver can't

654
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,400
process it. Right.

655
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,220
It's all liver. Anything you put in your body within three minutes, the liver reacts.

656
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,100
Right. So it's liver function.

657
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,560
So what do you know about liver function?

658
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,660
You know, so, yeah, high blood pressure, the same thing.

659
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,340
And yeah, it's all fiction.

660
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,420
I'd say 90 percent of what the medical community indulges in is pure fiction.

661
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,540
And about 75 percent, I'm not going to say 90 percent of the diagnoses that they give

662
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,220
people are fiction because let's say 20 or 15 percent are emergency medical.

663
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,080
Right. If someone cuts you with a broken bottle, it's hard to misdiagnose that.

664
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,940
Right. So so I'd say 75 percent are misdiagnoses because you got to include some of the

665
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,320
emergency medicine in there.

666
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,460
But it's a it's a big fraud like the money system and the religious system.

667
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,220
And you want to go on the legal systems, complete fraudulent.

668
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,700
So you just happen if you're listening to me, you happen to be on in a world where

669
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,600
they base their stuff around fiction.

670
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,600
You know, I think they have transmissions when they go out from the earth and ETs

671
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,060
pick it up. They don't know what to make or they think we're totally insane.

672
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
Some think we should be destroyed.

673
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,820
Other things avoid this place because they think all the I love Lucy shows and CNN

674
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,700
that makes it out there is how we really are.

675
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,840
Right. So they had to put up a secondary beacon satellite to say, if you get any

676
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,460
transmission from earth, don't ignore it because this is all for entertainment.

677
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,220
They have to explain what entertainment means.

678
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:17,580
Right. So they're not not not much entertainment of that style, I guess, elsewhere

679
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,940
because they don't necessarily understand that that's what it is right away.

680
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,880
Yeah. They don't know what entertainment is because you look when you get down.

681
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,300
Like, for example, I'll say personally, I don't need to be entertained because

682
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,700
anything I do is entertaining.

683
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,680
Yeah. You know what I mean?

684
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,220
When I anything I approach, I approach wholeheartedly with my full mind and desire

685
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,280
to do it. If I see that I can't put my full mind and full desire to engross and

686
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,900
put passion and desire and my skill behind something, I'll just say I'll pass on

687
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,060
that. Why do you it's called.

688
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,080
Otherwise, it's just half fast done.

689
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,880
Right. You got to have your heart into it.

690
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,800
That's why when you and I have a private cause, I don't want to get into making

691
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,620
websites. I don't want to get into doing that.

692
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,000
I mean, I can't do it.

693
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,800
I could do it. It's going to be half fast for me.

694
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,700
I'd rather have someone who could put 100 percent.

695
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,220
Right. You see, I'll tell you right now, if someone if someone says, you want to do

696
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,380
this, I'll look at it. If I can't put 100 percent of my effort in, I don't want to do

697
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,100
it, you know, while I'm doing it.

698
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,520
Right. Right.

699
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,280
OK, so if it doesn't entertain you while you're doing something, then you don't want

700
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,960
to do it. Well, when what I'm trying to say is, is when you put 100 percent of your

701
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,020
effort, skill, love, intuition, desire into what you're doing, the entertainment's built

702
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,680
into that. It's built in.

703
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,560
You know, it's like getting the car with the with all the fancy audio system.

704
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,700
You don't have to put it in later.

705
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,480
I don't have to do something and then entertain myself.

706
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,420
You see, you see.

707
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:44,100
So when you find yourself in that state where everything is built into what you're

708
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,940
doing, you don't need an extra, you know, entertainment thing.

709
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,040
It's built in. You know, I did not expect you to go in this direction today, but this

710
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,680
is this is very interesting to me, though.

711
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,300
I like this.

712
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,280
OK, so sorry.

713
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,940
I just felt the need to say that.

714
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,420
Natural disease is what I because I wanted to get into that a little bit.

715
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,000
We kind of left I left off sarcastically the last time.

716
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,540
And I just want to finish off a few thoughts.

717
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,540
Well, please do, because look, here's the thing, right, is that we've all been given to

718
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,020
this idea. Look, just naturally occurring.

719
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,820
Certain things are going to happen seasonally.

720
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,360
In fact, they'll tell you that certain things happen during certain seasons.

721
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,680
Right. Because there's greater exposure to pollen and stuff like this.

722
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,520
So via induction.

723
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,660
Right. You're going to breathe some things in.

724
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,740
They're going to get in there.

725
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,660
You're saying a lot, though, there because season and pollen, if pollen was really a

726
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,620
problem, they would build a dome over the city.

727
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,800
So when the pollen came like a bad sandstorm, everybody goes underground.

728
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,800
No, it's not. It's the individual that has that.

729
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't have those allergies like my wife does sometimes with certain plants.

730
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,540
And that's because of the energy flow.

731
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,240
I think we got into it in one of the sonics.

732
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,160
Right. Yeah, well, yeah, because but the season has to do with seasonality, not the

733
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,840
season. In other words, eating like if you're eating food, if it's getting cold and

734
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,320
you're eating food that was grown in a warm climate, you're going to your body's going

735
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,960
to lose vacuum because your body is going to be adjusted to the tropical food while

736
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
you're living in the cold and vice versa.

737
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,900
If you're in the tropics, you need food that from a cold place, your body's going to

738
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,000
say, hey, what are you doing here?

739
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,420
You know? Yeah, yeah.

740
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,200
But I but I get clogged up with, you know, I mean, not as bad as I used to.

741
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,900
And I got to tell you, if I'm around cats, I can't be around cats.

742
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,020
You lose vacuum. OK, here's the thing.

743
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,700
If you get clogged up, runny nose, weepy eyes, swelling.

744
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,240
Yeah. That means your body.

745
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,560
It's a signal you're losing biological vacuum.

746
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,220
No different. The opposite of that is you got a bicycle or car tire.

747
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,220
You want is kind of low.

748
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,660
It's losing pressure.

749
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,820
Right. It's the same thing.

750
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,760
It's just which direction.

751
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,280
You know, the pressure in the car tires pushing out and the vacuum in the body is

752
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,800
pushing in. Right.

753
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,240
So when you have swelling, you know, if you've ever seen a corpse, human corpse, what

754
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,800
does it look like after a few hours?

755
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,540
It swells up, starts to swell up.

756
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,320
Yeah. Yeah. Because it lost vacuum.

757
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,800
So if you want to know that what a biological vacuum versus no biological vacuum in

758
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,120
this similar body is look at someone laying down in bed that's alive and sleeping and

759
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,480
someone who's been dead for a day.

760
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,460
Big difference. So it's irrefutable.

761
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,120
You know, so that has to do with seasonality.

762
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,520
By the way, the seasonality is vacuum also.

763
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,480
Right. You know, let's go back to car tires.

764
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,360
You know, you want to check your pressure when the tires are warm or hot on a cold day

765
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,300
like you just put, let's say, 75 degrees.

766
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,660
The tires are at 35 degrees, 35 PSI, you know, American metric, American measurement,

767
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,200
let's say, pounds per square inch.

768
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,000
Right. But it's 75 degrees.

769
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,660
But if it goes down to 40 at night, you measure it's 28.

770
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,240
So do you want you don't want to put the right you want to you want to put it let's

771
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,620
say you live in a cold place like Alaska, then it gets a little more tricky.

772
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,040
But still, you don't want to inflate the tires until the temperature is at a higher

773
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,020
mean temperature.

774
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,640
Body is the same.

775
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,860
You know, when you start losing biological vacuum, you go through sleep therapy.

776
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,300
Right. You relax, you stop moving, because if you the body vacuum goes down, you lose

777
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,040
levity, literally levity.

778
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,240
You're not standing up because your feet, you know, you're balancing yourself.

779
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,800
It's because you're actually experiencing slight levitation.

780
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,200
You know, you're if you remove someone's arm, it's about two pounds of bone and meat,

781
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,200
maybe three pounds.

782
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,000
When you're lifting up your arm up and down, do you feel like it weighs like it's

783
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,640
heavy? No. But when people aren't feeling well, they say, oh, my arm feels heavy.

784
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,660
Right. Your whole body feels heavy, you drag it.

785
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,480
Yeah. It's not the muscles that make it feel light.

786
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,440
It's the it's the levitation that you're experiencing.

787
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,280
So so here's a small thing.

788
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,500
If you want to go to advanced aspects of levitation, you know, anti gravity and all, just

789
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,460
study biological vacuum and how you counter that in a direction

790
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,240
where you increase it and increase it mean counter because it does have a limit, you

791
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,220
see. OK, so natural disease, the effects and what causes it, it's it's not

792
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,740
what causes it's the anti cause.

793
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,920
OK, so how did I know this was all fake?

794
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,460
And I've talked about this for a long time, but I'll reiterate, OK, in order to have a

795
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:17,280
quote unquote pandemic, you have to have a lack of running water.

796
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,960
I don't know how else to say that if you're living in the country, that means if you're

797
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,180
wherever your water source.

798
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,300
Whatever it is, whether it's a well, a stream or a creek or whatever that that goes

799
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,520
away or gets polluted in the city, what would it be either really dirty water

800
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,980
when you open the tap or no water?

801
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,940
OK, once you get into that condition, lack of running water for for hydration

802
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,720
and sanitation for in washing.

803
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,360
Number one. Number two, the waste products, sewage and garbage

804
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,460
is not separated from your main sources and your dwelling.

805
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,860
Right. So if the sewers go down or the garbage,

806
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,560
you know, decay, organic material, mostly animal and other things.

807
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,940
OK, if that's not done properly.

808
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,540
OK, so you have to have the two working together where they had the cholera in London.

809
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,420
Many people died. It's because they started putting new pipes to put taps

810
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,940
in London, but they were running them near the sewer water.

811
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,600
Right. And they would mix sometimes.

812
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,240
So you have to keep them separate.

813
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,780
Right. So if you can't separate the garbage and the sewage from where you live.

814
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,060
And you have no clean and running water, you're going to have, quote unquote, a

815
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:37,540
pandemic. The other thing is stressing the food supply, low quality food,

816
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,180
which already exists, by the way.

817
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,420
OK, so you have to see the food supply being stressed, stressed.

818
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,400
No lack of running water and and sewage separation and, you know,

819
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,800
presence of waste, human waste, animal waste, whatever, and garbage.

820
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,560
Once you have that, you have all of the not necessarily now, but about you're on your

821
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,220
way to having disease breakout.

822
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,320
OK, it sounds like that causation is a plague, what they used to say.

823
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,380
Sort of. Sort of.

824
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,980
Yeah, they're really bad plagues.

825
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,760
Look, I'll give you a little thing here.

826
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,540
You ever heard a patient zero?

827
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,140
OK, they always play.

828
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,400
OK, this is actually a reality of it.

829
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,120
They very rare to be a patient zero.

830
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,580
You don't even have to show symptoms and you don't have to show that you will

831
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:33,320
symptoms or be under under the malady or actually suffering the disease.

832
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,980
You know, to be symptomatic, they might say.

833
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,960
Right. C.R.A.

834
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,220
symptomatic and all that.

835
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,980
Now, the way that's done and this I've gotten this also from someone who in East

836
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,660
Germany back when it was it was in East Germany.

837
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,600
I'm going to bring up another East German here because of if we get into a little

838
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,800
more talk. But there was always a really bad stink.

839
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,140
And after East Germany went down, that stink went away in the forest because there

840
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,480
was an underground biolab base and they were doing it properly.

841
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,500
It wasn't like the Wuhan thing with stuff in the freezer with Petri dishes.

842
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,500
What this East German base was doing was the way that pandemics were created all

843
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,700
throughout history. What they did was they would capture humans, prisoners and put

844
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:22,600
them in cells, either two people or three people or a single with an animal, usually

845
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,320
a bird or rat or other animal.

846
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,580
And no one gets food or water and there's no toilet.

847
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,860
So after a few days or a week, you're so hungry, you kill the animal, whether it's a

848
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,120
rat, a chicken, a bird or a goat, and you eat it.

849
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,320
But remember, you can't wash your hands and you have no toilet.

850
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,140
And they keep this going for about a month or two.

851
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,340
Then you'll notice people start getting really, really sick.

852
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,560
Right. You can't.

853
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,280
Right. So you're in a month's worth of poop with a dead animal.

854
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,780
OK, but then you'll notice most if you have 30 people, you're doing this with

855
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,860
prisoners. It's pretty horrific, by the way.

856
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,500
Yeah. Right.

857
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,580
So you have 30 to 100 people.

858
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,680
You'll notice that most of them die, but there's one or two people who are just

859
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,240
fine. Well, you go up to the guy who's just fine.

860
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,120
Very carefully. You have other people do it.

861
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,800
You give them a toothbrush, a shower and a shirt, some new clothes, some money.

862
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,900
You're free to go.

863
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,900
Maybe some brainwashing, wipe their mind, right?

864
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,660
Some drugs. Free to go.

865
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,180
Go home.

866
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,000
Well, they go home. Everybody's so happy.

867
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,000
Welcome them back.

868
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,100
Suddenly the family starts getting sick.

869
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,160
He's still fine.

870
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,440
And they and their friends and whoever they contact get sick.

871
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,440
They're still fine.

872
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,640
They got patient zero.

873
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,120
I just gave out the whole outline.

874
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,920
There's more to it.

875
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,880
This is how the American army flu started.

876
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,880
You know what they call the Spanish flu, which started in Spain because

877
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,540
they delivered the men to Spain.

878
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:59,360
It was the only country that would take an American warship back in World War

879
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,880
One, right? Because remember, England was still the enemy back then.

880
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,420
Sort of.

881
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah. And the only reason the American ship was able to land in Spain is

882
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,980
because it said, hey, you remember the Spanish American war?

883
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,820
We'll pay you like two million dollars reparations if you let our ship land.

884
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,920
And it was bad news.

885
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,800
The crew on board, the army knew that it was there was something wrong because

886
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,360
they told everyone on the ship to be unsegregated.

887
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,420
Everybody sleep like what a segregated way.

888
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,700
You know, something's up here. Why are they being why are they doing

889
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,680
unsegregation? Right.

890
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,040
Anyway.

891
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,340
So this is the way the all these the

892
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,200
the Mongols did this in Europe.

893
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,800
They'd go through villages and capture men, women

894
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,120
and children, keep them prisoner.

895
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,300
And they put guinea pigs in cages with them.

896
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,980
And the same scenario.

897
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,500
No food, no water, no toilet.

898
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,820
After about a month or two, everybody's dead except this one little girl or

899
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,020
you know, whatever. A couple of people.

900
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,880
And they dress them up and bring them back to the village where

901
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,760
they came from. You're free to go.

902
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,300
And everybody is so happy that you're back.

903
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,400
Right. Lots of what do they do when they thought you were dead and they

904
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,340
see you? Hugs and kisses.

905
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,500
Hugs and kisses, throw a party, invite neighbors over, right?

906
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,340
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go.

907
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,660
Now, this is all by induction.

908
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,080
You could do all the blood tests you want, all the fluid exchange.

909
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,760
Now, if you probably did a fluid exchange with the patient zero, the one who's

910
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,180
transmitting this literally transmitting mean like a radio tower.

911
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,600
This is the mystery of it. But this is not ever taught because it leads to too many

912
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,380
other questions. Like, for example, if you're taking biology class and you

913
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,040
show us, let's say, a slide with the human intestines,

914
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,240
even a microscopic died slide.

915
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,880
If you took a sample of the human intestine and put a dye on it, I don't know if

916
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,420
you guys are familiar with microscopes.

917
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,360
They always everything goes like all fuzzy rainbow colored.

918
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,760
It's kind of hard. So you put a dye in there to blur all that light out.

919
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,800
Right. Even if you did a lung tissue scan or

920
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,920
with your own equipment.

921
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,240
And show that nothing penetrates the intestines or the skin or the lung tissue or

922
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,660
most of the organ tissue or any of the organ tissue, and then showed, you know, a

923
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,640
bicycle tire crossing and see how it's almost the same and say, hey, there's no

924
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,120
absorption going on over here.

925
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,520
Nothing passing through here. It must be through induction of some kind.

926
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,220
Right. This is not difficult to do.

927
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,320
Why? You know, well, once that is taught in school and people start thinking along

928
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,640
those terms and developing the field of study and the science based on induction,

929
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,000
is it really difficult to imagine that disease is

930
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,580
also transmitted that way by induction?

931
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,000
Also, by the way, when you read serious, let's say books, old published stuff,

932
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,920
even new published stuff, reference books on disease, it's not called it's there.

933
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,680
It's called induction anyway.

934
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,740
It's induced.

935
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Yeah. Induced. Right.

936
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,220
Yeah. Yeah. So it's so blatant.

937
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,000
So blatant until, OK, give you an example, there's

938
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,800
Andreas Wecker, W.E.C.K.E.R.

939
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,000
He traffics in essential oils like the best essential oils in the world.

940
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,700
And when I was trafficking water spring to back in the day, we were in the same

941
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:25,380
place, Rossum, and he's an East German gold medalist gymnast.

942
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,060
OK. And, you know, I went by the Greek or whatever.

943
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,080
And, you know, he's a German.

944
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,660
And we talk a little bit about politics.

945
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,300
How are things there?

946
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,660
He would never want to talk about anything about back home.

947
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,720
And the reason why it was very simple, and neither did other people that were with

948
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,760
him. Anytime you brought up anything, even looking political, he just shut you down.

949
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,960
He said, stop. I said, well, why?

950
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,400
Why don't you want to even talk about it?

951
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,660
Because we don't have a government.

952
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,200
That government that's there is a government that was put in a long time ago, has

953
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,700
nothing to do with us at all.

954
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,680
At all. So he was quite aware and very adamant that he, whatever was being shown,

955
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,140
right. But the Americans are not.

956
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,860
It's just as drastic there as it is here.

957
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,920
The Americans just think that they still have a government.

958
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,340
Like, let's go. Who voted this?

959
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,760
And it doesn't matter. You know, there's nothing to vote for.

960
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,600
There's not. You know what I mean? It's all a big show.

961
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,060
Right. But what I appreciate about Andreas is he was very adamant about zero

962
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,740
discussion until we get something legitimate.

963
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:33,220
It has nothing to do with who you vote for or what it has to do with after World War

964
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,980
Two, it was replaced with this artificial non-existent entity.

965
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,880
But most people still think they have a government.

966
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,440
But he was very adamant about that.

967
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,520
I've gotten this from a couple of other people.

968
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,820
There is someone also from Russia is very much like that.

969
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,960
Basically, they haven't had a government since before the Bolsheviks.

970
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,080
Very adamant. Doesn't want to talk about anything because it's all like talking

971
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,140
about Mickey Mouse or Disneyland cartoons.

972
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,660
But the Americans are taking it seriously still that they have a government and

973
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,320
this, that and the other. So the interesting thing is what?

974
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,660
From a side note, if you have any political interests or economic or anything

975
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,340
that has to do with quote unquote government and their agencies.

976
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,820
The only way you will see a change is if people completely disregard of what is

977
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,200
existing there as being legitimate in any way.

978
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,260
At all, until that argument or point of view comes up, you're not going to it's

979
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,480
just, you know, fairly fairy tales and fairyland, you know, and the proof I think

980
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,940
I've given in the past, I also gave it on a recent interview.

981
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,580
People were talking about the recent bank failures, the reason being bonds and

982
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,760
Chinese banks and this.

983
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,140
And I'm like, there are no banks to, you know, they're all operating under

984
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,420
emergency. Right now, someone once put put a little thing on me, says we're not

985
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,800
operating under emergency anymore.

986
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,820
I said, yeah, there's been about several acts in the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s that

987
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,500
were not an emergency anymore.

988
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,740
And the reason why overall is because the people have completely accepted the

989
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:11,640
system. But in other aspects, they still say we are under emergency indirectly.

990
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,500
Right. You see what I mean?

991
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,040
There's a big there's a big difference.

992
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:27,720
It still is because, yeah, your evidence, again, that it's all fake is the the US

993
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,980
Treasury says they're twenty three trillion minus.

994
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,100
How are they paying anything?

995
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,280
How can they write?

996
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,200
How could they cut a check for one government employee for a thousand dollars?

997
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,200
How is it possible?

998
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,020
No, we talked about this last time that if you had a bank account of any kind, you

999
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,040
know, the way it was explained to me initially is, look, you can only write a

1000
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,040
check if you have the funds in the account to cover the check, to cover it.

1001
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,940
That's what you have to do.

1002
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,680
So how is it that you can be at a deficit?

1003
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,700
If you're at a deficit of ten dollars right now in your bank account, you know,

1004
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,700
theoretically, you can't write me a twenty dollar check and have it do anything

1005
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,220
other than bounce. Well, no matter what the deficit is, let's say the deficit was

1006
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,460
one hundred bucks. If I gave you one hundred bucks, you still can't write a check

1007
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,580
because it's not with zero zero.

1008
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,740
Right. You have to have.

1009
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:21,860
Yeah. So but but the real thing is there is no debt because there's no way to pay

1010
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,280
for it. Number one. Number two, that's just a formality.

1011
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,660
And credit card debt is a formality.

1012
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,120
Also, you see, it's drunk.

1013
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,220
But here's the thing that I haven't I try to bring home to people.

1014
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,020
When you get a stimulus check, let's say for a thousand bucks.

1015
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,400
Right. It's ten to one fractional.

1016
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,440
So really, the bank, when you when you give the check to the bank teller, some

1017
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,380
people are going to say, why is he talking about this again?

1018
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,080
Because it's important. I want to talk about the third party here, too.

1019
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,580
If you get a stimulus check from the U.S.

1020
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,680
Treasury for a thousand bucks and you go to the bank, open the envelope and give it

1021
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,320
to the teller, she's going to give it back to you, says, I can't do anything with

1022
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,480
this. You say why?

1023
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,140
Because you have to sign the back once there are two signatures on there.

1024
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,240
She has a transaction number and she types in a thousand dollars and the thousand

1025
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,060
dollars appears because she can't type anything in until there's two signatures on

1026
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:14,560
there. OK, but behind in the comptroller, the legal department, the bank comptroller,

1027
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,440
it's ten to one fractional that thousand dollars becomes nine thousand now because

1028
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,720
ten to one, it's not really ten thousand, it's really nine thousand ten.

1029
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,600
It's ten to one becomes nine thousand dollars.

1030
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,660
So three thousand of that nine.

1031
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,080
Well, you get the thousand out of the nine.

1032
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,880
So they're left with eight thousand and the eight thousand.

1033
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,740
A third of it goes to the Treasury.

1034
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,920
Three thousand goes to the Treasury and three thousand goes to the bank.

1035
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,640
And the other two thousand just floats around or it's an asset or for whatever on

1036
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,780
paper. But it's like an attorney takes a third, the one third in piracy.

1037
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,260
Right, right. OK, so that's general.

1038
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,280
But the numbers could go back and forth.

1039
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,360
All right. So so this is how they're funding stuff.

1040
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,640
So this doesn't make any sense to people because they haven't set their mind around

1041
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,020
the system. Every country is the same.

1042
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,040
All the banks are the same.

1043
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,740
All finances are the same.

1044
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,540
If you're a government and you want to finance a project that the ledger shows you

1045
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,560
don't have the money for, you start giving checks to people and you know that's

1046
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,020
whatever amount you give to the people is going to come back nine times and you get

1047
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,220
a third of that. You see how it works.

1048
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,500
So years ago, I think when Bush was in office, there was somebody saying, go out

1049
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
and spend and get in debt. We could use the money.

1050
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,040
Yeah. Publicly.

1051
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,700
They said that. Go shopping.

1052
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,920
We can. We need the money.

1053
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,780
All right. That was that was a big thing.

1054
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,220
And I'll tell you, there's a trend right now of, you know, come and sign up for

1055
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,040
these cards.

1056
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,440
I don't know if you've seen this online a lot, but they're saying there's all kinds

1057
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,980
of programs. You can get money delivered to you every single month if you just sign

1058
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,400
up for this card.

1059
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,100
Perfect. And there's tons of them like out there now.

1060
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,680
Yeah. Remember, the more money is being created, the less money that's in

1061
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,600
circulation is going to be worth.

1062
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:08,120
Right. So that's why I tell people, maybe on previous Sonic events, I said, you

1063
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,260
know, inflation is kind of low for the amount of credit that's being used.

1064
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,160
You're going to get hit with a big inflation boom here soon.

1065
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,860
And it didn't happen when I thought it would, like by the 2020, 2019, I said,

1066
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:24,340
ooh, if people if there isn't a big jump in inflation by 2019

1067
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,580
or 2020, it's going to get really bad.

1068
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,800
And when it gets really bad, you have to at least double your salary.

1069
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,940
You know, a lot of things are double the price that they were almost double.

1070
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,720
Things that were 15 are now twenty three dollars.

1071
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,200
It's not quite or twenty five.

1072
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,120
It's not quite double.

1073
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:43,140
So if you're not if your salary and they're doing this deliberately or deliberately to

1074
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,220
hurt the population.

1075
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,920
Well, this is regional right now.

1076
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,780
I've gone over these numbers on other shows of mine where I say, look, they keep

1077
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,580
saying that there's this level of inflation and it's B.S.

1078
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,320
because depending on where you are, it could be double or two and a half times what

1079
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,320
the price was only two years ago.

1080
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,400
That is not 40 percent.

1081
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,980
That is not 16 percent or whatever percentage you're representing it as.

1082
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,660
There is a realistic price increase.

1083
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,760
It's eighty one.

1084
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,740
Yeah. Someone recently crunched the numbers for me recently, like two months ago.

1085
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:25,140
And he says overall, most goods like from lumber to food to clothing, it's eighty one

1086
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,580
percent increase in the past two years.

1087
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,500
Price increase. That's that's exactly where I'm coming up to.

1088
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,100
That is exactly what I started coming up to as an average of I thought it was about

1089
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,080
seventy five percent.

1090
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,020
But even even so, I think we're in the same area here.

1091
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,740
Yeah. Eighty one percent was what they came up with from lumber to food to clothing

1092
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:49,440
and building materials, cleaners, all that general stuff that gets sold.

1093
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,260
Not we're not talking about washing machines and cars and houses.

1094
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:58,680
No, no, no. Commonplace daily items, daily requirements, let's say for your basic

1095
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,500
requirements, food, shelter, food, shelter, clothing.

1096
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,740
Right. If you take a look at those things.

1097
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,940
Well, yeah, I was thinking seventy five.

1098
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,180
But then again, I'm not a mathematician.

1099
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,140
Yeah, they did the math and it came out to eighty one point six nine whatever percent.

1100
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,640
And yeah, yeah, it's about right.

1101
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,200
This is just from two years ago, three months ago.

1102
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,680
Now, in other words. Absolutely.

1103
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,880
I believe that. I absolutely believe that number.

1104
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,800
Yeah. OK, so and essentially, so when everything goes up 80 percent, how many people

1105
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,340
salary going to go up 80 percent?

1106
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,880
The most they're going to get is five percent.

1107
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,360
Right. Yeah. Well, that was the so that's right.

1108
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,380
So that's how that's how that works.

1109
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,100
So and at the same time, I'm working on starting a high end speaker company where a

1110
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,180
pair of bookshelf speakers are ten thousand to fifteen thousand.

1111
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,640
And these are like the size that if you go to Best Buy, you get a pair for fifty bucks

1112
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,520
right now, real small speakers, you know, like tabletop.

1113
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,680
And I found out that that market is never going to be hurt.

1114
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:59,220
You know, OK, so it's very interesting to be in that market, by the way, because, for

1115
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:03,800
example, if I build these bookshelf speakers and I have a way to create sound that no

1116
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,080
one else can, let's say messing around with the laws of physics, even though they're

1117
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,320
small bookshelf speakers, they sound the full output of the floor tower speakers, but

1118
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,260
very, very high definition.

1119
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,900
The interesting thing is I have these small units that I'm building with the packaging

1120
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:24,280
material. The way you have to the packaging is very expensive.

1121
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,860
You know, if you're going to sell a pair of speakers to someone for ten thousand or

1122
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:33,620
fifteen thousand dollars, let's say the you can't just throw them in a cardboard box

1123
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,520
with some peanuts, you know, packing peanuts.

1124
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,840
Right. So they each have to be in a separate case.

1125
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,220
And that goes into another case which goes into a double box.

1126
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,980
And then, yeah, it gets very interesting.

1127
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,560
And the packaging gets actually almost as expensive as the materials.

1128
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,680
Well, not really, but to build these things.

1129
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:55,860
So so what I'm on a side note, I'm suggesting when things go bad, focus on the high end

1130
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,160
economy, but not as a servant.

1131
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,440
You know, if you're a maid for like Donald Trump or Rockefeller, you still get paid

1132
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,840
minimum wage. You know that, right?

1133
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:04,680
No. Yeah, yeah.

1134
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,920
Yeah. You don't just because you're made for a billionaire doesn't mean you're going to,

1135
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,720
you know. So, yeah, but providing their stuff, you know, I also might want to get into

1136
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,280
selling, you know, fifty dollar a liter, a bottle of water to them.

1137
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,160
Right. You know, because believe it or not, when it gets because when the inflation goes

1138
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,800
up, they're on the front end, they're going to dip, they're going to get wealthier and

1139
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,180
wealthier. Sorry to say.

1140
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,560
You know, so that's what's happened even in the publicly observed numbers, right, where

1141
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,900
they say that what a new billionaire was created like every day for about a year during

1142
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,000
this, you know, pandemic, when you see all these small businesses went out of again the

1143
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,280
pandemic. I'm using that.

1144
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,820
But you know what I'm talking about, the time period where you had all these shutdowns

1145
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:52,940
and lockdowns, et cetera, a whole lot of small businesses went out.

1146
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,200
They were gone. But that's the idea.

1147
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,120
That's well, that's where the inflation comes in.

1148
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,800
Give you an example. When the Walmarts come in on the targets, the Home Depot's, the

1149
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,900
small stores go out of business eventually.

1150
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,360
Not all of them, but mostly they do.

1151
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,080
Now, when I went to an AutoZone or a Walmart or Home Depot, they would raise the prices

1152
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,780
exactly what the Federal Reserve Index was overnight.

1153
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,520
So I bought like a roll of some damping material.

1154
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,460
And let's say at Home Depot was twelve dollars.

1155
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,020
The next day it was fifteen dollars.

1156
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,140
The week after it's nineteen dollars.

1157
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:31,160
Right. But if I go to the hardware store, initially it was twelve dollars, but it's

1158
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,200
still twelve dollars. They haven't raised their prices.

1159
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,820
It was expensive before, more expensive than Home Depot.

1160
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:36,860
But they're not adjusting.

1161
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:42,980
So your main your large circuit, what do you call those big chain stores, big box

1162
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,040
store, big box stores, all of them, whether it's automotive, house, food or whatever,

1163
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,220
even a Walmart is attached to the Federal Reserve.

1164
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,940
They change their prices on the fly where the little mom and pops don't.

1165
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,860
If they have the inventory, they'll say, hey, we paid 40 cents for this.

1166
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,360
Selling it for a dollar is fine.

1167
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,640
Well, Walmart paid 40 cents for it.

1168
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,140
They sold it for seventy five cents.

1169
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,400
But now it's a dollar fifty.

1170
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,480
Right. Right. So so what I want to say was what I was saying twenty five years ago or

1171
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,920
more, avoid the chain stores if you can support local business.

1172
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,320
Doug, that's such a cliche.

1173
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,480
Well, here you go.

1174
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,400
This is why you do it. Right.

1175
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:22,320
Another example, like spark plugs I was getting for three bucks are now eleven bucks

1176
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,760
at AutoZone. How can you go from three dollars to eleven dollars in one year where at

1177
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,200
the small mom and pop auto shop there were five dollars, not three dollars.

1178
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,380
So I didn't go there. But now there's still five dollars or six dollars, not eleven.

1179
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,420
You see. Right.

1180
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,960
So there's this interesting thing.

1181
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,140
But I tell people, if you don't find a way to double your salary in the next year, I

1182
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,620
think we said it on one of the open.

1183
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,300
You're going to you're not going to be able to live the way you're living, depending

1184
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,660
on how much you're making, of course.

1185
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:55,260
But you see, no one's going to get their salary double, by the way.

1186
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,320
So, yeah, I don't I don't see that.

1187
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,820
I mean, I know a lot of people talked about the raise in minimum wage and this and

1188
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,660
that. But truthfully, that's not panning out.

1189
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,860
We know it's got to be minimum wage.

1190
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:11,140
There's got to be just under 30 bucks an hour, like twenty five to thirty bucks an

1191
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,120
hour to.

1192
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:18,340
Yeah, because when the minimum wage first came out, it was just a little bit over the

1193
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:22,300
price of silver. So the price of silver now is around twenty dollars an ounce per

1194
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:27,080
hour. So you have to be over twenty three or twenty four dollars an hour to be a

1195
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,060
minimum wage comparable to what you could buy in the 70s.

1196
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,859
Right. Give you an example.

1197
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:37,160
So, yeah. So, yeah, the fifteen dollars at McDonald's ain't cutting it or whatever.

1198
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,359
So, yeah, it's it's a you know.

1199
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:45,279
I used to use the 1968 index, which would give you that approximately a couple of

1200
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,760
years ago. Anyway, the exact number was twenty five dollars.

1201
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:51,160
Now it's up. But either way, you're right on target.

1202
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,620
If you use the 1968 number and you just adjust for inflation, that's it done.

1203
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:01,240
An easy way I tell people if they if they work by time, by the hour, just a dollar a

1204
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,399
minute. That's the easiest thing to remember.

1205
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,580
Right. So an hour is 60 bucks an hour.

1206
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,359
Right. That seems to be prevailing.

1207
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,580
Someone pulling wire in California, the prevailing wages around that a dollar a

1208
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,040
minute, you know, to pull wire through a building for an electrical company.

1209
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,439
They get a dollar a minute.

1210
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,080
Well, I told people a dollar a minute's a fair a fair wage if you're working.

1211
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,600
Right. It is. Well, look, it is.

1212
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,260
But but where can you get that again?

1213
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:31,300
You know. Well, you find it.

1214
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,260
You make it happen. Yeah, somehow.

1215
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,840
Yeah. Where? Where?

1216
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,279
What? That's the big question at all.

1217
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,680
As long as it doesn't lead to your death, as they tell people, most of the stuff, the

1218
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,680
information that we're given that doesn't lead directly to your death, but it's always

1219
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,040
these big things that you'll probably end up dying happen.

1220
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,740
You'll probably end up dying before most of these things happen.

1221
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,860
Right. You know, especially if you look at all the spiritual advice and all the health

1222
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,140
advice, you'll die before that happens.

1223
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,220
Right. So that's why I call like leading to death advice.

1224
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,600
You know, most people don't get practical stuff.

1225
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,380
That's why I've always been talking about food, clothing, shelter and all this other

1226
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,540
stuff. Focus on that.

1227
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,500
You know, this has been a very practical discussion so far, but I know you wanted to

1228
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,320
get into, you know, the third person aspect of this.

1229
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,760
Now, I had a thought about it when you were we discussed this just a little bit before

1230
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:27,320
we started recording, you know, and I was thinking to myself, royalty in the way that

1231
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:31,440
they refer to themselves or the way they used to, you know, we are the queen or we are

1232
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,480
the king or whatever.

1233
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,340
This third person thing, right.

1234
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,180
A lot of people think of that as an egomaniacal weirdness where somebody refers to

1235
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,440
themselves in the third person and all that.

1236
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,660
But you had something to say.

1237
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
That's the high. Yeah, good.

1238
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,440
Yeah. People of high spiritual standing always do that.

1239
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:58,380
Also, you'll see it in the legal and also you'll see it in formal language use.

1240
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,940
Like just real quick, anybody can sense this by looking up or remembering it.

1241
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:08,380
When you read what the Christ said in the New Testament, for example, he always

1242
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,160
referred to himself in a third person.

1243
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,840
An example would be when you see the son of man coming down from the clouds, he's

1244
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,100
referring to himself.

1245
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,560
Always speak to the third person.

1246
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:25,560
If you read any of the ancient texts that were either the being or the person

1247
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,100
speaking verbatim in their speech, they're referring to themselves in the third

1248
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,780
person always.

1249
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,560
And this is usually of higher spiritual nature.

1250
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,860
People tend to do that.

1251
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,060
Why? Because when you are of higher spiritual nature, you know that you're occupying

1252
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,800
this body, the container, right?

1253
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,840
You are not the body.

1254
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,260
Right. This is sounds cliche.

1255
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:51,800
So you happen to be using it like when people say like when I nearly chopped the

1256
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,060
thumb off, I said I didn't chop my thumb, nearly chopped my thumb off.

1257
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,140
I'm just using this thumb.

1258
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,980
So more accurately, the thumb on the left hand, not my left hand.

1259
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,480
Right. You see.

1260
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:07,660
So this is something that once you start, it will cultivate a certain level of

1261
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:12,800
spirituality or your mind in you, and it'll make you more objective and you'll be

1262
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,340
able to easily see through things that you weren't able to see through before.

1263
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:22,580
If you start to seeing yourself occupying anything that you're doing as a visitor,

1264
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:27,640
as a sojourner, as you're just using it, not not owning it.

1265
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,820
Right. Kind of an example.

1266
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:36,800
For example, if you go into certain languages in a highly respectful form, instead

1267
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,100
of in Spanish, it would be Ustedes, which is plural for Usted means you.

1268
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:47,060
So when you're asking someone, how are you, you in a very high form, Ustedes is

1269
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,340
plural, like how you's doing, like you guys doing, but it's just one.

1270
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:56,680
And in Greek, instead of saying Ustedes, which is or Ustedes is to one, you would

1271
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,040
say Ustedes as in plural.

1272
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,020
So when you're referring to someone else in the high formal Latin and in Greek,

1273
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:10,220
the you're you're addressing who you're speaking to in a plural form as if there's

1274
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,540
more than one person there.

1275
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,780
You see, that is another form of third party.

1276
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,240
Yeah. I was just going to mention that.

1277
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:19,300
I mean, I have a bit of a grasp of Latin and I know that that's in the more proper

1278
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,020
form of Latin. That's how you address.

1279
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,500
It's a high form.

1280
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,940
Yeah. The singular is proper in Vietnamese.

1281
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,900
It would be also like you would say when you're addressing.

1282
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,380
In Vietnamese, it would one individual of respect, it would be Cuivi, which would be

1283
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,720
the plural form again.

1284
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,900
So you'll see this. It's a high like there's high in Spanish, high Latin, high

1285
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,840
English. Right.

1286
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,040
You'll find it.

1287
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:54,200
So not only referring to yourself as in the third person, but also to others in a

1288
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,320
plural form that gets a little sketchy unless it's already part of the culture.

1289
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:05,360
Right. So like in Greek or in Latin or other languages, I'm not familiar with the

1290
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,220
cognates in Chinese.

1291
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,740
I'm familiar with some of it in Korean, the Jean-Baptiste in the Hangul.

1292
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,400
But I think Jean-Baptiste also is almost a third person.

1293
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,960
If anyone speaks Korean, let me know.

1294
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,240
But I haven't practiced that in a long time.

1295
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,580
The other thing, as I suggest people, if it's a sign of respect when you're going to

1296
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,480
be interacting with someone where English is or whatever language is their second

1297
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,680
language, when you learn their core language, you can also use certain terms not to

1298
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,840
play to be placating or flattering, but just to show out of respect.

1299
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:45,200
Like if a foreign dignitary was sending someone to another country, right, you want

1300
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,600
to send someone who speaks the language.

1301
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,460
Right. Usually.

1302
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,060
Of course. Yeah.

1303
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,880
Yeah. So this is the same.

1304
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,060
It's out of respect. Right.

1305
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,080
Americans tend to be the worst.

1306
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,320
I've seen this before, even since I was young.

1307
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,660
You're an American now. You got to speak English.

1308
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,880
Right. You've probably heard that yourself.

1309
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:02,500
Right. Of course.

1310
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:08,820
Yeah. So yeah, there's a term called the ugly American is what they were known

1311
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:13,340
as in Europe, mostly back in when I remember the 70s, 80s and 90s, because they

1312
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,220
always demanded everything be their way.

1313
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,560
But that's another discussion.

1314
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:23,620
But once you start referring to things in the third party, then you start to see how

1315
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,080
presumptuous this world is.

1316
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,140
You also learn a lot.

1317
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,080
This is the important part from those around you.

1318
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:36,120
When you start hearing people say this is my or my thing or my this or my that or my

1319
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,460
leg, my website, my foot, my car, my, my, my, my.

1320
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:48,020
Guess what, from a spiritual level, let's say from one to ten, ten would be like, you

1321
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:54,720
know, a Christ type figure and one would be your dog, you know, halfway a number five

1322
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,560
would be someone who starts to discern.

1323
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,900
Not everything is mine, but once you once you the more mys you hear my this, my that,

1324
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:07,880
my thumb, my hair, my car, my this, my that, that number goes down and down and down and

1325
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,860
down and down. Right.

1326
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,640
In terms of rating them spiritually, if you can get half of your discussion instead of

1327
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,680
my hair, the hair, I know it gets kind of it's odd.

1328
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,940
Right. Instead of my thumb, the thumb.

1329
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,680
Right. What do you mean the thumb?

1330
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,520
The thumb I'm using.

1331
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,300
Right. If you can do 50 50, you'll be halfway spiritually evolved.

1332
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,820
You know what I mean? Like half you'll start getting it.

1333
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:36,200
And it's really hard when when you anyone comes across a certain methodology or

1334
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,700
perspective or an idea, it's very foreign in the beginning.

1335
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,280
And there's always doubt that says, well, I'm not going to do that or I can't do that.

1336
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,220
Or how funny is it?

1337
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,060
Will it be if I start doing that?

1338
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:52,100
Try it. I highly suggest people to start lending things into the third category.

1339
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,620
This is how the legal system works, by the way.

1340
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:00,260
This is how many of the high spiritual, let's say, beings that we can access what

1341
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,580
supposedly they said, it'll always be in the third person.

1342
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:10,060
You see, I've always wondered about this myself because, you know, I've always found it

1343
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:18,640
strange that people feel as though they can take ownership of anything because you don't

1344
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,700
really actually own much.

1345
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,500
No, you know, like in other words, everything is very temporary.

1346
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,780
Your entire time where you're occupying the container is very temporary, very temporary.

1347
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,100
And you may have control over certain things.

1348
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,280
Right. But you don't really own them.

1349
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,620
I've always felt out about ownership.

1350
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,880
Well, this is that's many levels to ownership, you know.

1351
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:54,720
Uh, OK, well, if you say you own your body, well, all the legal paperwork says you don't.

1352
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,640
OK, when you go to court, your name is always in all the name you're using, the sound

1353
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,640
that you answer to.

1354
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:06,480
That's all a name is, right, is always in all caps because you're collateral for that

1355
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,520
all caps right now.

1356
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,520
They'll deny it because, you know, there is supposed to be an adversary.

1357
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,440
They're a private group there.

1358
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,480
The legal system in every country is there to administer the bankruptcy.

1359
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,680
Right. Doesn't matter which country you're in.

1360
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:26,980
My praise goes to like the East Congo, Somalia, Darfur, places like that, you know,

1361
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,620
where at least you have local warlords, you know, and they'll behead any missionaries

1362
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,020
that come through there, that kind of stuff.

1363
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,340
They're pretty hardcore about understanding.

1364
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,700
And the reason I have them in praise is this.

1365
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,140
You can claim ownership, let's say, with land or anything like that.

1366
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,860
That's fine. Anybody can do it.

1367
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,280
But you cannot really back that up unless you can defend it.

1368
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,920
Right. Right.

1369
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,320
Are you going to. So if you want to know who owns the land you're on.

1370
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,680
Well, you got the police there to defend for who.

1371
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Right. No.

1372
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,880
Yeah. You see in the fire department and all that stuff.

1373
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,920
They they work for those that supposedly.

1374
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,400
But they'll never tell you directly.

1375
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,400
They own it. But they are the agency, for example.

1376
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:11,140
So, like, you know, most people don't understand there's no private ownership of

1377
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,040
land. Now you can get away from all the taxes and fees if you just use the law with

1378
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,800
the law, says, for example, in the US, everybody talks about property taxes.

1379
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:25,040
Right. Well, first of all, all the laws on property tax says that it's for profit.

1380
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,960
Right. So let me ask you, if the property is used for profit, it's a residence.

1381
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,940
Now, you know what a residence is.

1382
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,920
You're a resident in a hotel, a prison hospital.

1383
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:41,040
Right. Somewhere where you live, where you are staying, where you are.

1384
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,480
Right. Staying temporarily.

1385
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,620
You have no claim, no claim to.

1386
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,960
You're not an inhabitant.

1387
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,840
The law doesn't have inhabitant anywhere.

1388
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,920
It doesn't say people, it says resident.

1389
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,720
So and it has to be.

1390
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,080
And if it's used for profit.

1391
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:59,140
So let me ask you where you eat, sleep, wash, fuck, do all these other things right in

1392
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:02,280
that building. Are you doing that or any of that for profit?

1393
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,480
No. And so that means you're not.

1394
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,120
Are you an inhabitant? Yes.

1395
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,080
Are you a people? Yeah. Show me in the law where it says people and inhabitants where

1396
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,520
they eat, sleep, shit, you know, and all that stuff has to pay.

1397
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,800
They don't. It's very simple.

1398
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,720
It's for taxation.

1399
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,080
I mean, it's for you're making a profit.

1400
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:24,520
And someone I was working with on recently said, what about for what if I'm renting

1401
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,840
out the house and I'm subject to the property?

1402
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:33,460
I said, no, because it's a private contract and you have a right to personal.

1403
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,100
It's in all the laws you to all your what is it called?

1404
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,460
Personal effects and papers.

1405
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,840
Yeah. Privacy. Right.

1406
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:39,860
Yeah. Fourth Amendment.

1407
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,180
So, yeah.

1408
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,880
So you're not this is a private contract.

1409
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:44,980
So buzz off. Right.

1410
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,120
You see. So there's no tax on that either, because all of his rental, you have to.

1411
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,060
Well, if you report it as a public part of the.

1412
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,180
OK. And by the way, well, you know, then how are the municipalities going to function

1413
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,580
about the property tax so they could just print all the money they want?

1414
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,380
All right. You don't need taxes.

1415
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,420
Don't pay for anything. I'm not against tax.

1416
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,580
Just like I'm not against if I need a hammer to break a sidewalk.

1417
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,020
I have a rotary hammer, a jackhammer.

1418
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,940
It's too small. It won't go through four inches.

1419
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,680
I got to go rent one. Right.

1420
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,200
A big one, like an 80 pounder.

1421
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:23,600
OK. Do I expect to go rent and use the store's jackhammer and get it and bring it back

1422
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,520
and wave goodbye and leave and that's it?

1423
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,100
Or do I have to pay him a rental fee?

1424
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,140
You're saying let's pay a rental fee.

1425
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,280
That's what taxes are. You have to report or they assess you.

1426
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,520
You know, we assess this property is that much you're using.

1427
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,480
You know, and, you know, we claim on and they can never say they claim.

1428
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,680
It's just ambiguous.

1429
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,720
But while everything is ambiguous, let's see what we can get.

1430
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,840
It's very interesting how it works.

1431
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,780
It's all presumption, all third party.

1432
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:52,680
You know, if you go to a municipality or city and say, why are you taxing?

1433
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,400
He says the state gives us that authority.

1434
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,500
So then you go to the state.

1435
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,540
Why are you taxing? He says, we're not taxing you.

1436
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,500
The city gives you gives you the authority.

1437
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,100
And you go back and forth passing the buck.

1438
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,020
Right. Because no one can.

1439
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:07,520
So but they can make your life very difficult because that's what they're here for.

1440
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,120
You see, it's not here to be easy.

1441
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,960
Yeah. Without compliance, you will have difficulty.

1442
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,060
That's for sure. Yeah.

1443
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,800
No. Well, no, you are compliant.

1444
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,000
Even if you say I'm not subject to that, you're still complying.

1445
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,360
It depends, you know, you're complying to because you don't fall under that category.

1446
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,380
Right. No. OK.

1447
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,900
OK. I get you. Yeah.

1448
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,420
Like if I don't like I don't work at Dunkin Donuts.

1449
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:35,740
So no, someone can't knock on my door and say, you didn't comply to your work contract.

1450
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,380
You didn't show up. I never had a contract to work with you guys.

1451
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,500
But the guy who's who's fell asleep late, the Dunkin Donuts manager come to his house.

1452
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,480
Hey, you got a work contract with us.

1453
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,900
You're not complying. You got to come to work.

1454
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1455
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,040
So it's all propaganda and brainwashing.

1456
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,320
But it's it's pretty rough place, you know.

1457
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,920
Look, at least you're not under the Vatican, you know, directly.

1458
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,920
Oh, no, not directly.

1459
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,100
The horror stories, you know.

1460
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:08,080
Although they did declare at one point that every soul on Earth belonged to them.

1461
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,360
Right. Yeah.

1462
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,300
But they can't prove it.

1463
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,580
All they have to do is put out the presumption and you got a billion people out there that

1464
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,360
believe it. Yeah, this is this is the type of places.

1465
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:20,760
But the third party also, it'll all be it'll all be third party.

1466
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,060
All your legal stuff is presumption.

1467
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,760
And it's a fiction.

1468
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,080
Actually, you could look up legal fiction in a browser.

1469
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,220
And it'll basically tell you everything and anything legal is a fiction.

1470
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:32,600
Yeah, of course.

1471
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,480
Yeah. Well, people say, you know, legal or illegal, who cares?

1472
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,980
That's just a sick bird, right?

1473
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,640
No, I know that's the concept you were you were you know, when you when you brought up

1474
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:47,320
the name in all caps, I was thinking about the concept of legal fictions and and so on

1475
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,920
and so forth, because that's really what they're what they're dealing with with that

1476
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,460
administration is the legal fiction.

1477
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,560
You show up, you answer for it.

1478
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:01,480
You're agreeing to come, you know, to to deal with that particular element, which is

1479
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,820
not you, although it's got the same name, the same sound that you answer to.

1480
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,500
Right. And they can't address it.

1481
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,380
They just make fun of you.

1482
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,240
But here's the thing.

1483
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,540
This came this is also a big proponent of what happened in the Nuremberg trials.

1484
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,200
So remember, everything is acting under a state of emergency.

1485
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,340
Everything's temporary goes day to day to day.

1486
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,920
That's why if you go down to the court buildings, all they're not judges.

1487
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,820
Interim judges, temporary, all of it is.

1488
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:31,860
OK, that's why even the POTUS, he's the current acting POTUS, right?

1489
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,940
The current acting one.

1490
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,100
They can never say he is the president, right?

1491
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,900
He is the current acting current elected something, right?

1492
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,580
Everything is temporary.

1493
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,540
So what they got out of the Nuremberg trials is this, that in the future, if everything

1494
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:50,160
is corrected and brought back to being lawful and they pull out all the paperwork and they

1495
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,960
said, well, you unlawfully imprisoned these people.

1496
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:55,280
They'll say, no, we didn't.

1497
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,760
We just went after this trust name that we had registered, Department of Health and

1498
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,140
Human Services, and they just volunteered for the rest.

1499
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,460
But but because you have no enforcement authority now, if you try to say that now, they'll

1500
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,580
laugh at you and whatever, right?

1501
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,560
See, because it all boils down to enforcement.

1502
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:20,460
So, you know, there is no lawful enforcement, right?

1503
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:26,780
In other words, if, you know, 90 percent, if not better, of the people in prison or

1504
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:30,520
a jail or they are illegally and unlawfully, right?

1505
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,940
So but the other thing is, do you want them all out back into society, right?

1506
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,480
But this is not the point where whether they did something bad that could be harmful to

1507
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,920
society.

1508
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:44,540
But once you're in there long enough, what happens to the individuals?

1509
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:50,280
You see, so yeah, once you're conditioned to that, I mean, I know nobody comes out better

1510
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,420
after a long stay.

1511
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,860
I'll put it that way.

1512
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:59,220
But for sure, the only people right now based on the system and people don't even know

1513
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,700
the difference between jail and prison.

1514
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,280
A jail is there to protect people.

1515
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:08,180
A prison is there for sentencing, but a lawful society doesn't have prisons.

1516
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,140
OK, what is a jail when there's a big bar fight?

1517
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,380
Everyone goes to jail because if they don't, they'll be the violence will continue.

1518
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:16,960
Right.

1519
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:21,640
Everyone gets arrested and while you're in jail, they get everybody's story and they

1520
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,400
could make a legal determination at that point who they should let go and who they should

1521
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,980
hold for a little longer.

1522
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,560
Right.

1523
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:27,920
Right.

1524
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:28,640
OK.

1525
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,060
All right.

1526
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:37,180
So when the accused is found guilty by confession or otherwise, they're sentenced to prison.

1527
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:40,180
But legally, they're bonded.

1528
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,840
And that's what funds your streets, by the way.

1529
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,140
It doesn't say thank you for your taxes.

1530
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,400
You ever see when they put up a new road or something, it's your taxes that pay for

1531
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:50,560
this.

1532
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,940
No, it's the bonds, birth certificates and prison bonds.

1533
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:58,140
It's funny, I used to call and say, yeah, you got this sign here.

1534
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,920
And in order for them to put it up, it has to have a registration number that they put

1535
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,400
the sign up.

1536
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,840
I said, this sign number so and so.

1537
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,760
What do you mean by bonds?

1538
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,560
Can you define them?

1539
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,500
It took me three months in a run around, run around, run around, run around.

1540
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:10,580
No.

1541
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:11,580
OK, so.

1542
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,920
So in a lawful society, there's no prison.

1543
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,200
Why?

1544
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,360
Well, very simple.

1545
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,400
If you stole, it's three times or twice.

1546
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,820
You have to pay back to who you stole from the value.

1547
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:24,920
Right.

1548
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:28,040
But but the reason the person stole is because they had no money.

1549
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:28,560
That's OK.

1550
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:29,340
You work it off.

1551
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:34,100
They become your servant at an agreed price for X amount of time.

1552
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:39,660
You see, or quote, unquote, slave or whatever, you know, you have to pay for it that way.

1553
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,900
If you kill deliberately, you're put to death.

1554
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:46,000
If you killed by accident, let's say what they call second or third degree, you can

1555
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,180
no longer live in that city.

1556
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,440
You have to go to another city.

1557
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:54,540
And if you ever leave that city and you're hunted down by the people that think you should

1558
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:58,800
be killed and you're not in that city, sorry, you can't be you're not protected.

1559
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,660
You see, it's called a city of refuge.

1560
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,340
And this goes on and on these.

1561
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:03,700
So there's no prison.

1562
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,960
There's no allotment for prison in a lawful society.

1563
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:12,620
But a legal society loves it because they're bonding everyone, you know, prison bonds.

1564
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,480
So what what I'm saying can easily be validated and verified.

1565
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,480
And I think I've gone over the police there.

1566
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,980
The police work for the private banks, all of them, whether you like it or not.

1567
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:25,380
Sorry.

1568
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,440
The sheriff works for the state or the county.

1569
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:36,560
And the only arresting or fine levying by law power they have is for littering.

1570
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,700
The sheriff can only write a ticket for littering.

1571
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,260
Sorry.

1572
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,280
In law, in their own paperwork.

1573
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,880
It's actually was on a Wikipedia page.

1574
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:50,460
When you look up the sheriff's duties, we talked about a little bit of the history.

1575
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:54,660
This is, by the way, they can only arrest or write fines for littering.

1576
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,480
It was on a Wikipedia up until recently.

1577
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,240
I think I made it kind of a stink about it.

1578
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,960
Someone said he got a speeding ticket by the sheriff.

1579
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,080
I said, so tear it up, throw it away.

1580
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:05,680
He has no.

1581
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:09,940
But you see, when you get the ticket, it has everything on their federal, state, local,

1582
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,600
blah, blah, blah.

1583
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:10,960
Right.

1584
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,200
So it's very interesting how the system works.

1585
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,460
It's the same system that people think planes went into the World Trade Center like a hot

1586
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,280
knife through butter, like what was her name?

1587
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,600
The stewardess came out a while back.

1588
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,600
She used to say that a lot.

1589
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,860
Do you remember her, Rebecca something?

1590
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:25,460
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,080
Rebecca Roth.

1592
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,240
Yeah, yeah.

1593
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,000
She used to.

1594
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,020
I like what she said.

1595
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,880
Something was wrong here when I saw.

1596
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,340
But here, take a subculture.

1597
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,140
You know, if you took the people that work in the airlines, the stewardess, the pilots,

1598
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:40,500
the mechanics and all that, how many of them came out and made a stink about what happened?

1599
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,600
Very few, not any.

1600
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:51,100
Yeah, so when you say the entire collective is useless, within the collective, there are

1601
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:55,820
other societies, you know, like let's say the people that work in the airline industry

1602
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,700
is like a subculture.

1603
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,240
How many of them came out and made a stink?

1604
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,720
There's like, what, half a million of them?

1605
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,120
How many?

1606
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:01,600
Is this her?

1607
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,000
So it doesn't show very well for any human.

1608
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,240
Small organization.

1609
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,100
What was it?

1610
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,040
Pilots for 9-11 Truth or whatever.

1611
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,280
They came out and had questions and, you know, various.

1612
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:13,920
Yeah, very.

1613
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,660
And then you have Dmitry, poor Dmitry Kalozov.

1614
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,560
I'll spell it for you.

1615
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:22,320
Dmitry Kalozov, the K-H-A-L-E-Z-O-V, I believe.

1616
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,480
He's right on the money.

1617
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:31,480
And when I first heard his testimony on that, it kind of shook me to the bone because I

1618
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:35,700
told people around me, I was told there were nukes in the World Trade Center back in the

1619
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,520
80s, but I didn't know what the hell that meant.

1620
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,600
I didn't know it was for demolition.

1621
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,120
I thought it was that big ball in the middle of the courtyard between the two buildings.

1622
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,100
You know, I had no idea.

1623
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:51,800
But it kind of shook me to the bone when, you know, you have a premonition or told something

1624
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,000
and then it happens in the future.

1625
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,740
So I think just to bring it back to where we started, we started off with the Project

1626
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,800
Blue Beam and all that.

1627
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,220
And you see how much headway that's made still is being talked about.

1628
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,800
But no one's being rational about it.

1629
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,200
They don't have to do holograms.

1630
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,800
All they have to do is put some CGI on TV and everyone will buy it that way.

1631
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,060
Meaning, you know, everyone won't believe.

1632
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:15,500
What is it?

1633
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:18,440
You can fool some of the people some of the time and not all the people all the time.

1634
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,840
You got to break it down even better than that.

1635
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,960
They're going to fool enough people that it's made.

1636
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:23,840
So, right.

1637
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:30,780
Well, that's the thing is if you've got a strong enough group, you know, not a majority

1638
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:37,400
necessarily, but if you have a significant minority, that's enough to sway everybody.

1639
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,900
Pretty much right.

1640
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,600
They're convinced.

1641
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,440
I mean, that's all there is to it.

1642
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:41,660
Yeah.

1643
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:46,600
And they're not even putting out quality product when they when they do show whether it's the

1644
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,380
World Trade Center or the future alien invasion.

1645
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,680
It's going to be really cheesy CGI.

1646
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:56,720
I mean, not so cheesy that you can see the pixels and segments, you know, but really

1647
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:01,080
cheesy because everything they do is really cheesy because they usually hire Muppets.

1648
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,100
They don't, you know, they don't really.

1649
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:03,680
It's funny.

1650
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:07,140
You know, you'd think they have all the resources in the world, but they put out junk.

1651
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,140
The easiest thing is the financial and the legal situation.

1652
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,320
You know, go look at the treasury again.

1653
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,700
Any treasury is all in the minus.

1654
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,500
How could they how could you work for any government and get a check and be good because

1655
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,660
you're funding it yourself.

1656
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:23,780
By the way, when you get a paycheck, that's a that's a rain check.

1657
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,860
You know, it's a paycheck.

1658
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,940
It's not getting paid.

1659
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,220
Right.

1660
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:33,020
And when you go and cash that paycheck, that money is the funds that you get, let's say,

1661
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,500
is created with your own signature.

1662
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,300
But they go back to your boss's account and take it out of his account to make it look

1663
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,500
like, you know, right.

1664
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,820
And that money is still in your boss's account.

1665
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,040
He just doesn't know how to get it.

1666
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,480
And if you try to get it, they close your bank account.

1667
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,120
Right.

1668
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,040
So this is the society that the only way to fix it is to physically remove the people

1669
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,360
involved in the system and the system being physically remove them from the world.

1670
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:02,880
You cannot, you know, let them be because they'll just come around and create another

1671
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,960
crisis and restart the whole thing again as it's been done over and I'll just keep doing

1672
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:07,140
it.

1673
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,480
Well, yeah, we're good, I think for now.

1674
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,640
That's what I was just about to say.

1675
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:17,960
I was thinking to myself, you know, you've come full circle in this one and I've got

1676
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,060
some interesting ideas for next time.

1677
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:24,400
But but wow, a lot to think about here today.

1678
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,160
So you want to you want to close it with anything else or should we just leave it there?

1679
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,160
We'll just leave it there.
