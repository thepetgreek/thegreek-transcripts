1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,460
Sonic event 70 or 70 as they say anyway rated why and here we are why because we love you

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,020
we've been doing this yeah we've been doing it that many times it's not how long it's

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,240
that many times you notice yeah it's like the counting it's like 70 times Wow okay

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,620
that's fine yeah all right we've almost eclipsed the amount of times that we got together to

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,780
do the other O and G incarnations I think that was less about 60 or 50 maybe oh about

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:54,400
two hours I know there's 40 hours of that yeah exactly 40.00 but yeah no it's it's we're

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,820
still going and people are still interested which is interesting the thing that I find

8
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,100
most interesting is you know well if you pull back and listen to what we talk about it's

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,740
not being talked about anywhere else in that in that scheme it's I don't know what's going

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,140
on by the way I mean I do know what's going on I'm dealing more and more with the public

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,360
and not like retail like a convenience store or shoe store or selling cars but with the

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,580
other things and I think people are going insane like when someone opens the door and

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,860
I meet them for the first time it's like this person is insane in other words what I mean

14
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:38,160
by that is the way you would cast an insane person looking like in a film right right

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,260
it's like look at those eyes look at that facial expression look at the way they speak

16
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,880
look at the way they walk look at their body gesture it's like this is not good you know

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,240
so I just wanted to put that out because I've been feeling that sentiment now for a few days

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,200
maybe a few weeks even and in other words when I meet people they look just like you

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,620
would cast someone that was insane how would you have them look right how would pick a

20
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,460
director right any director how would the director ask makeup set and crew says this

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,740
character is written in the script to be a nut job how would you have them look how would

22
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,500
you have them answer a door how would you have them greet you right anybody except Stanley

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,700
Kubrick leave him out of the equation okay that gets more intense yeah it does here's

24
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,780
the fun part about this is that I feel like you have now finally experienced what I've

25
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,560
been trying to tell you for the past few years which is funny because I keep saying it like

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,120
this nobody knows how to communicate I listen to conversations but that to me that to me

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,100
is representative of insanity where it's like look yeah I want to I want to I want to get

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,220
into that it's also hold that go ahead but I could just right here in the midst of this I can

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,580
just go Greek you know I like waffles with with cheese that's not what I'm talking about I'm

30
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,660
talking about how you would cast the way they look yeah but gesture but I'm saying I hear this in a

31
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,600
sonic way I'm hearing this insanity where it's like somebody goes well waffles and cheese well

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,700
that's okay because I've dunked my hand in a pot of gold no I'm saying a little different if you

33
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,880
were to read let's say the screenplay of what they say it seems very normal and very appropriate

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,280
but the way they say it the way they look in the way they gesture is definitely a crazy so you're

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,100
hearing sane dialogue but I'm hearing dialogue but yeah it's presented in a package that just

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,220
ain't right okay okay well at all and I'm talking about the majority of the people that are it's

37
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,760
not like crazy for you okay the other difference between okay when you're poor you're crazy when

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,300
you're rich you're eccentric right now the difference screen you know crazy it's what

39
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,280
it's how much how much money you got this is just not well spiritually psychology at all and this is

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,120
going more and more and more I'm seeing it and it's like whoa and you know it's good you know

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,140
it's good to voice these things so when anyone else picks up on this they have a little more

42
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,480
confirmation not that it's something that should be confirmed because you always want to be open

43
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:13,060
you know here's the thing judgment when doing observations though it is a sound bit of

44
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,019
reasoning to find confirmation which is not directly connected to something that's influenced

45
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:27,100
by you if you're making an observation though yes or no yes but it is more on a same sober

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,700
judgment okay judgment when people hear that word they think of it's like people that are

47
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,840
hypocritical maybe narcissistic or it's a spiritual religious thing right but the first

48
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,520
judgment that one must exercise is the mechanical judgment because you're in the material world

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:49,940
right no matter what you believe it is it hurts if you get cut or broken up or you know you're in the

50
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,060
material world you get hungry you get tired okay so the all judgments initial judges must be

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,740
mechanical material based that's why it's very important when people are scrutinized that you

52
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,180
always keep your clothes clean and pressed you have a clean car clean house so right you see I

53
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,940
mean keep the material stuff looking right so it's always I'm speaking from a material standpoint

54
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,480
okay now I said hold the thought on the communication because this is a I want to

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,580
give a few analogs about communication because one could bring up the subject there is no

56
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,920
communication and then pass over it but let me let's just do a little Greek speak analysis on

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,440
this because this is going to be helpful okay well please because the difficulty is always in

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:37,020
finding that which is empirical as opposed to that which is a subjective judgment you know

59
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,100
ephemeral but here let's let's just let's okay let's go down this road with communication sure

60
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,480
okay all right so you know this is the concept of a two-way street you know the concept of right

61
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,240
back foot forward on the same vein let's say okay so one way to judge communication there's

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,740
two ways you can figure out if someone communicates two ways from the positive and from the negative

63
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,040
without being antagonistic what I mean by this is let's say you just meet someone you barely have a

64
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,680
conversation and you bring up a concept that is well structured and simple but they don't understand

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,520
it and let's say we go a little further let's say you bring up something mathematical or technical

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,080
they don't understand it right they they don't get it okay it's a two-way street the reason why

67
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,720
people don't get it is because they can't communicate so you could actually find out

68
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,180
if someone is a good communicator by them getting and grasping ideas because if you can communicate

69
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,480
well which means structure mechanical meaning the sounds and the thoughts and you know how the

70
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,820
information relates to another being you will also the antithesis the opposite is true you will

71
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,160
also be able to comprehend more so people communicate have a hard time grasping also

72
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,580
it's a two-way street receiving okay right staying on that though that that's where I was

73
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,220
gonna go next is that here's the thing that you sort of jumped past and I want you to address it

74
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,560
is that look it doesn't matter you could have the greatest information and you could communicate it

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,040
perfectly but you must also have a receptor okay so here's the thing a radio so let me let me just

76
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,900
jump in real quick if there is it's receiving equally as broadcasting so if the people are

77
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,900
not receiving it right guess what they can't communicate so the better the communicate the

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,200
better communication skills the person has the better receptive skills learning skills acquiring

79
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,420
new knowledge is because it's the same thing it's along the same vein it's antagonistic yes

80
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,260
meaning when someone's trying to explain something and they're not a good communicator and they don't

81
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,320
really have a firm grip on what they want to explain it ain't gonna come out right no one's

82
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,740
gonna understand what they're saying right okay that person that is not a good communicator just

83
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,840
have difficulty communicating also has a problem receiving and typically leaving us it we call them

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,580
stupid or dumb or slow or whatever whatever and it's not it's not because we all have the same

85
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,500
abilities we all have it's just like you know the computer warehouse analogy I gave if you go

86
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,800
to a computer it's got one terabyte of hard disk and this amount of ram and all the same guess what

87
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,100
guess what's wrong computer quote unquote is smarter none of them they're all equal so what

88
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,580
I'm trying to say is that we all have the same hardware we all you know everyone can memorize

89
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,000
all the books ever written believe it or not we have no mental limit right so what's going on

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,780
is the communication faculty so here's the thing if you blur up the communication factor faculty

91
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,480
the broadcasting without even it's very efficient in other words what I'm trying to say if you could

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,740
mess up someone's ability to communicate thoughts ideas expressions information knowledge whatever

93
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:52,320
you also diminish their ability to receive all of that in one shot you don't have to mess up their

94
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,760
ability to express and then mess up their ability to receive you just mess up one or the other

95
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,220
and they both go down the tube well does that make sense yeah because it's a two-way street it's like

96
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,960
imagine one pipe that sends and receives if you put a dent or a kink in that pipe guess what it's

97
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:14,080
going to impair impede the ability to send and receive well what I'm hearing is this if you are

98
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,940
all on the same frequency right and we have you know the old no no no sorry sorry no it's not

99
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,440
frequency no frequency is later no frequency's not keep it keep it mechanical okay I am keeping

100
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,820
it mechanical I was going to something here if we're all on radios okay we have radios to receive

101
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,380
information somebody is broadcasting like they did on CB radios in the old days or you could

102
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,300
with a security that's okay hold on that's over that's over simplifying no because no this wasn't

103
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,320
there yet but okay okay but go ahead I don't want to drift off too mechanical because when I say

104
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,960
mechanical it's what you hear see touch smell and feel right not what you think about well this is

105
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,940
what I'm getting to though is that okay if you've got a broadcaster who is getting putting out

106
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,540
pertinent information that's useful absolutely clear and broadcast perfectly and someone gets

107
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,280
into that very same frequency turns around and opens a mic and puts it next to their car engine

108
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:16,220
or whatever else now you have an interference that is drowning the original signal well no no

109
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,060
it's not interference I think it's operational ability I'll give you an idea okay okay

110
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,740
you know the analogy you know if you hear jazz coming out of a radio you think you're

111
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,560
gonna open the radio on this little jazz band no the thoughts and all these things are the same it's

112
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,760
they're not in your head they're external so when you say frequencies when someone thinks about

113
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,920
saying something that's already out every anyone can receive it ergo telepathic person would hear

114
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,960
it right like one famous thing to do if you're in a big city like San Fran or New York or Tokyo

115
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,760
when you're walking down the sidewalk right constantly think about if there are any ETs

116
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,420
on the sidewalk in this crowded street I want to say hello and then if you do this for a few days

117
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,040
somebody will keep thinking that someone will stare at you and you'll say you must be an ET

118
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,240
because you heard you heard this and they'll nod and they'll keep walking right it's kind of crazy

119
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,660
right so it sounds crazy sounds very sci-fi but try it if you're in a big city you know you got

120
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,200
to be persistent with it okay so what I'm trying to say is that it's always put out it's not like

121
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,000
you're putting out a frequency to let's say someone else and they're not picking it up you're

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,460
putting it out to everyone is what I'm trying to say it's out in the ether always you see so when

123
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,340
you're communicating to one person you're just not communicating to one person you're putting it out

124
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,200
on the ether let's go back to the analogy you use well I like the radio for that reason yeah yeah

125
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,840
let's say you have a cb do you think uh you want to call me on a cb handle and I'm the only one

126
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,680
that could hear it no anyone that gets on you know 400.2 will hear it right for whatever frequency

127
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,880
we're using right you see so uh so that's exactly what's going on but the thing that I'm trying to

128
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,140
say is there's a tweak an alteration a bug something in the hardware in between the hardware

129
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,080
and the software of the mind that when the person's when you notice someone who can't communicate

130
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,740
right you can and you just met them you don't know them well or even if you know them or if

131
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,040
they can't communicate well guess what they won't be able to grasp ideas either because it's a

132
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,600
two-way street so if you meet someone that you don't know well they can't grasp ideas well guess

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,200
what when they start telling you a story you won't know what the hell they're talking about they can't

134
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,900
communicate you see it's a two-way street so it's very important so what this what the significance

135
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,660
of this is is this we typically call one or the other label socially people as being dumb or

136
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,220
they're stupid and I'm telling you they're not I've since early greek speak days I've always said we

137
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,940
all have the same you remember external input we all have the same capabilities everything there's

138
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,920
a tweaking but we begin with basically the same hardware and processing processing and it's it's

139
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,800
just like tuning you go to a guitar shop 100 guitars on the wall take them all down uh pull

140
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,700
the you know whatever you want to pluck none of them are going to sound the same right never now

141
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:09,040
you can tune them so they get close right that's fine right we don't expect them no two loaves of

142
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,380
bread are baked alike no two people are the same you can do people watching and you'll never see two

143
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,000
people with exactly the same features even lookalikes do not have exactly the same features

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,340
you know you've seen like the obama lookalike right oh yeah okay you look at him and his ears

145
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,280
are just a little too big compared to obama but everything else is fits to a t so you're never

146
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:33,040
going to find okay so what i'm trying to say here is that the important part is this is mastering

147
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,820
let's say the field of psychology the field of human relations or human self-improvement

148
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,920
is that this is just another way to assess those around you and yourself if you find yourself not

149
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,160
communicating well guess what you're actually not receiving no matter what you think you do

150
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,060
you're not receiving either well either so if you can receive well you can project well and this is

151
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,600
this is not the ultimate you know let's say this is always true because there what if you can

152
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,180
receive well but you can't communicate because of again a mechanic mechanical impediment right

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,480
so there's there's exceptions to this but i've noticed this now from observing people for about

154
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,520
six decades that those that can't communicate well don't receive well and it's not an aptitude

155
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,780
problem it's it's something between the mechanical and the process right and this is not being

156
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,280
addressed by the way and actually it was at some point i remember as a young student in the crazy

157
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,920
school system it might have been around what's called the eighth grade that's when i stopped

158
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
paying attention they did something called speech class i don't know if you remember that

159
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
it's not because yeah you get up and you just uh speak to an audience how to do public speaking

160
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,840
right right right matter of fact that's what they called it where i was public speaking yeah yeah

161
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,180
public speaking and i don't think that's well i don't know somebody can check me but i doubt that's

162
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,660
even being done anymore uh as it was back then so that also if you did well with public speaking

163
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,780
and you were struggling let's say quote unquote learning you would find yourself from taking that

164
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,180
public speaking class and learning how to structure your communication skills you will

165
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,700
find that your learning skills would also go up right yeah so if you were struggling with math

166
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,040
now you may not be struggling with math as much or whatever this is an interesting point because

167
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,200
it's not an aptitude problem right now it's a matter of orientation because they they they

168
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,100
would teach you to order things in a particular way to say yeah yeah well yeah it's just like

169
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,820
look you know tying your shoelaces you know everyone learns how to tie their shoelaces

170
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,440
quote-unquote everyone uh but they all learn they remember it differently and then after a while

171
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,420
it's rote you don't even have to remember how you remembered it you just do it right right

172
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,700
so this is this is the the level that i'm speaking of but it's not don't separate it

173
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,740
imagine just one pipe where liquid flows in both directions or air flows in both directions if you

174
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,640
stuff up that pipe you can't just say well now we're not going to get receive air you can't give

175
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,320
air either because the what you receive and what you give is going through the same conduit you see

176
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,020
right it's not one or the other you'll you won't find someone who is a good communicator that

177
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,420
doesn't grasp ideas well or knowledge well that doesn't that's not true but if you find someone

178
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,640
who's not a good communicator i'll bet you for sure they can't also grasp new ideas well either

179
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,980
so it's very interesting so there's either an obstruction or there's not that's really what

180
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,940
the difference it's a tuning issue yeah it's a tuning issue but this again just to say this again

181
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,400
this issue let's call it an issue right okay is misunderstood as people being dumb or stupid and

182
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,540
they're not it's a skill problem so in other words instead of trying to increase people's

183
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,200
aptitude and learning skill why don't you just work on the communication skills on one side

184
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,720
and the other side the learning skills pick up also and vice versa you see it's very interesting

185
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,280
and i've been and i've put this together very recently uh because it just kind of hit me here

186
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,720
here's the thing you know i talk about yin and yang right right and you know when you know it's

187
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,900
not about polarity people try to make positive negative hard software it's about antagonism so

188
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:19,339
something becomes one thing the the antagonistic quality uh seems to go well with it right so um

189
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,480
so yeah so it's one thing or another so in other words when you're wondering let me give you an

190
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,880
idea of yin and yang and how the universe works by antagonism not polarity um when you're wondering

191
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,160
about something right uh what it is or whatever and the more you wonder and think about it without

192
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,700
an answer your brain becomes mean it spreads out it becomes soft it becomes on the issue right and

193
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,140
then the only way you could receive the information is like a bolt of lightning it just hits you in a

194
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,900
second right so if you start you know the opposite is true if you start thinking on something very

195
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,680
strongly on focusing on one very narrow issue the more you do that you're going to find yourself

196
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,940
getting really wishy-washy about everything else right very soft and you'll fall apart that way

197
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,600
right so it's it works also with the thinking process when someone communicates and they're

198
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,940
very wishy-washy you're not getting the point right um they will see receiving knowledge as

199
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:25,480
a bolt of lightning that they can't handle and vice versa if someone is yeah is this akin to

200
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,380
okay you ever get yourself a bit flustered because you can't remember where something is

201
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,020
it's misplaced you're certain you knew where it was not too long ago yeah my brain you turn okay

202
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,840
fine yeah you you turn around let's just say it's a we'll use a common item keys right people lose

203
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,420
track of their keys all the time uh and you don't know where they are you don't know where they are

204
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,400
you're looking around you're digging around if you back off and just ease up a bit right and sort

205
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,280
of relax for a moment it hits you right away a lot of times just boom it comes to you just like

206
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,540
exactly and it but it and if you're focusing on the keys too much though right right if you if you

207
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,940
focus too much it'll be a very wishy-washy feeling yeah it's uh yeah it's interesting the antagonism

208
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,240
so in other words a harsh communicator will take in information very wishy very spread out and

209
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,700
unaccumulated right so it works also that antagonistic aspect works back and forth

210
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,180
i found it to be very interesting as a revelation to myself lately and i've been testing it

211
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,440
you know with people that around me uh those that i know and those that i don't know and just taking

212
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,640
mental notes and seeing you know how the antagonistic part works too so what i mean is

213
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,620
like when someone's not a good communicator very wishy-washy not getting the point when you present

214
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,180
a new piece of information to them you actually almost physically see them jolt as if they put

215
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,460
their finger in an electric socket it's kind of interesting and then people who are very forceful

216
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,640
with their communications when you give them a new piece of information they kind of calm down and

217
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,820
like they're in a they're in a bath of water the opposite right so i just wanted to see if well

218
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,040
this is one other thing i want to express the whole concept of the yin and yang and all that

219
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,300
right oh my gosh it is i occasionally look up to see because people go online they're not very few

220
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,400
well even if you i'm saying go to the library you look stuff up it's like a joke now right because

221
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,840
you know all the good stuff didn't removed anyway of course after 9-11 especially so

222
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,840
but after covid even more so um look up there's nothing really online that i could recommend

223
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,900
maybe some books uh from the macrobiotic point of view uh which by the way macrobiotics is not

224
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,860
just a modified type japanese diet it's not a way of eating but it's a way of thinking just the whole

225
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,640
idea of it leaning on food is because you know food is converted into energy and food is converted

226
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,840
into your body literally you are you know they say you are what you eat no you are what you ate

227
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:01,980
yesterday you know what i mean that's true yeah correct uh uh correct tense on that would be uh

228
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,380
you can only be what you've already eaten not what you yeah you're not what you eat you are

229
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,840
what you ate you are already eaten in the past yes yeah so when you hear someone talking nonsense

230
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,860
what did you eat for dinner last night what does that have to do with it you know well guess what

231
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,800
it does affect you so so from that point but it is understanding antagonism it is understanding

232
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,080
things it's helped me quite a bit with the transmutation work and other things like that so

233
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,880
what i might be talking about in the future if i can work it out more just like you know i worked

234
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,820
out the water thing and a bunch of people started building them and got similar if not same results

235
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,120
the other things i'm working on and which was with induction biological induction material

236
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,240
induction very much on the vein of homeopathic but not on the vein of homeopathic where they

237
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,900
have a very fine dilution we're talking about no dilution no contact right and still getting it

238
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,200
across them still working on that and it'll be quite interesting because the results are not

239
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,820
consistent enough to say build this and this will happen right uh if i if i build this and it happens

240
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,520
one out of ten times they i could maybe have a discussion group to help me on it but i'm not

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,640
going to come out and say build this and this will happen even one out of ten times because it's not

242
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,480
you know it needs to be worked out right you might you might stop at this question but i have this

243
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,960
question i've had this question in my mind a few times and i haven't brought it up because it

244
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:31,800
wasn't appropriate but now you've given me the the the uh open lane here's the thing if i understand

245
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,680
that a whole lot of things okay a whole lot of realities a whole lot of

246
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,760
natural and even unseemingly unnatural although it is all natural processes

247
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,220
occur via induction right energy matter indeed all this stuff seems to occur by induction

248
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,920
why is it that we are not able to do you know what what people would describe in like sci-fi circles

249
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:04,340
is like how about telepathic communication simply give the idea to someone else by induction without

250
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:12,000
any sort of standardized communication how is it that we are not able i disagree before you go it

251
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,140
is happening but it's not happening the way you expect it to happen yes i know that part of it

252
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,010
but someone might say that if we could learn to be more willful with this

253
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,350
right exactly well that's the what we have do we're dual-minded you know that term dual-minded

254
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:34,610
okay well we there's one aspect of being dual-minded that you cannot avoid and that

255
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,750
is the body has a mind of its own we went over this several sonics ago quick recap

256
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,810
absolutely there's someone's regular spiritual mind is so depressed they want to kill themselves

257
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,410
so they drown they try to drown and while they're drowning their body's mind which has a separate

258
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,450
mind what that keeps all the involuntary actions going right circulation nervous heartbeat and all

259
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,410
that he's like wait a second what are you doing to me i don't want to die i want to live that's

260
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,090
my whole purpose that's why i keep the heart pumping that's why you're breathing that's what

261
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,990
right so they have this dual-minded so so not only is the person thinking they have to kill themselves

262
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,950
but while they're trying to do it they're going to discover that there's another one of themselves

263
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,430
that is running their body right so that part that's that's the other part of yourself i'm

264
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,930
you brought this up because this is part of the whole work it's a there's a mental connection to

265
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:26,210
what i'm talking about well again that's your body is doing and you know how i mentioned the

266
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,910
body's is the body's mind is keeping the heart rate and the all the involuntary actions going

267
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,690
right well guess what well the induction that's happening from nutrition and elimination because

268
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,810
remember induction also happens on elimination side and rebuilding of cells and all the minerals

269
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,730
and things that are created and elements that are created that's already happening it's in your

270
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:54,130
body so now the the idea is can you reflect that or have that go beyond the body or do things that

271
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,250
are beyond the body to affect the body right through that mind so yeah we already know how

272
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:06,310
to do it but not with the mind that we normally use the the the mind that the body has in other

273
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:12,790
words let's extend it further that is the soul it is the metabolism it has its own intelligence

274
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:18,290
but it's innate and it's interchangeable right that's why well there's a lot of sci-fi which is

275
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,470
quite accurate when someone dies they transfer their consciousness to a computer so they keep

276
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,730
living or a clone right well that consciousness transfer there's a the part that was their body

277
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,050
that soul dies right so that you know so there is a distinction between two but there is no conversation

278
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:43,010
uh if there was a direct conversation between the body's mind and the spiritual mind you wouldn't

279
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:49,370
have cancer existing well even unless it's sudden unless it's a sudden thing because even if there

280
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,330
was an ability to directly communicate one body's mind sort of to another body's mind there might

281
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:01,050
be ways of repairing things for instance your body's mind is not really sure how to deal with

282
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:06,710
something it's working through the process maybe my body's mind has the answer already

283
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,690
gives it that information or even gives it the correct energy look i see what your problem is

284
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:18,030
here it is you know my body's mind does this not my mind per se does this hey look here's your

285
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,870
solution what you need to do is uh take this in and remove this from the equation you'll be fine

286
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:29,270
sure what you just described is that one of the core things that uh is about reiki but people

287
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,890
that practice reiki can't say that they don't know how to explain it either so i mean you just

288
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,730
you just explained it the healing by touch and hands and all that yes you don't have to think

289
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,770
about it because the body already knows what to do but the thing is can you mimic it can you not

290
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,730
even mimic can you duplicate the reactions and it's a reactionless reaction by the way you can't

291
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:54,390
show you know how chemists chemical reactions are written out and because of valences these things

292
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:59,170
combine or these things break up or at certain rates or give off heat or whatever yeah there's

293
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:04,430
the observable we can't do that based on yeah this is this is in between that it's kind of like you

294
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,750
could say when an atom is looked at very very closely however they want to look at it several

295
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,790
ways they notice that even the densest materials they just notice there's just dielectric space

296
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,230
there so that means that anything that's material is actually phenomenal even we are action even

297
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,050
induction in and of itself right there's a certain part of the process where you or i as far as i

298
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:30,710
know maybe you do but i don't have a way to even communicate what happens at a certain point i can

299
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,830
say okay here's energy the energy is now being induced from one place to another but you see that

300
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:42,910
part of the process i don't have okay well here's for that i could give you one right now very

301
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,890
simple you've seen the time-lapse photography where they show a flower wither or a spree a sprout

302
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:53,430
or a seed go to full plant or say a sunrise you see it happen in a course of like you know 10

303
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,770
seconds it goes across the sky whatever yeah let's let's stick more like with that uh the

304
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,870
plants and living things okay have you ever watched in slow motion a wound heal and and when

305
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,370
and there's two ways to do this one is to use the technical aspect of it where you use a slow motion

306
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,270
camera leave it on for three days and someone you know is not moving around too much and you play it

307
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:19,170
a minute right or you can actually watch it yourself in real time and then take all that

308
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:25,490
real time and explain it as if it's happening in fast motion i'm sorry slow motion fast motion

309
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,350
however you want to say it right when we record three days and show it in one minute that's fast

310
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,270
motion photography this is where somebody takes you know the the a tree over the course of an

311
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,350
entire year and you can actually watch the tree move because the whole thing actually moves at a

312
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:46,410
uh but but you all right so two minutes over but it was a year so this is how the induction works

313
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,830
so you have a membrane whether it's the skin on the outside of your body or the skin on the inside

314
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,430
of your body or your intestines on the inside of the intestines or the intestines on the outside

315
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,410
of the intestine your lungs on the inside of your lungs or the outside of your lungs it doesn't matter

316
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,830
either side of any skin or membranes you pick any organ you pick any blood vessel you pick any

317
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:12,250
whatever okay so what happens you have material on one side and it receives a command but it's

318
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,790
not a command like we think commands are it's a conditional command in other words

319
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:23,290
it's not do this and the person has to do the conditions have to be right to for it to receive

320
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:29,330
the command and the conditions are many so the membrane whatever it is organ membrane skin

321
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:36,330
whatever bone doesn't matter our material on the right gives the command in the material is able to

322
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,030
resonate with the commands and it goes from let's say solid it goes to liquid goes to gas and then

323
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,450
it goes to energy which is that energy that holds an atom together it's a dielectric wouldn't the

324
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,890
energy come first before yeah well well we're we're speeding this is all mechanical judgment now

325
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,670
okay so so so let's just say let's just make it a little easier i'm just trying to put the process

326
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:04,730
in order yeah sure let's do it like this very simple the inside of the intestines called the

327
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:11,810
lumina right the whole you know the tubes okay so food is in there okay and um the intestines are

328
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,410
working a certain way they're they're different they work different than any other organ because

329
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:23,190
their command to that food is going to be whatever it is uh bologna and margarine on white bread

330
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:32,570
is going to say hey you are now going to uh a liquid and then a gas and then to energy a

331
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,350
dielectric energy and soon as you become a dielectric energy energy you you permeate the

332
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:46,870
you get absorbed permeate uh go into the actual intestinal wall itself right now on the other side

333
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,610
of the intestinal wall is where the rest of your body is guess what happens that energy now is either

334
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:59,550
stored in the intestinal wall in the blood or immediately goes from what energy to gas okay to

335
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:06,550
liquid to solid again but not like it not like that's what cancer is by the way one one mechanism

336
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:12,430
of cancer when the body reproduces what you ate on the inside and if anyone's worked in cancer

337
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:18,030
biopsies when they look at tumors they'll find plant tissue in their animal tissue teeth hair

338
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,950
things develop that shouldn't be inside the body right because you have this this mess up

339
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:29,430
kind of like in star trek one of the movies where the the um the transporter wasn't working well

340
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,650
they tried to beam someone up and they arrived as a massive pile of flesh they died right because

341
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:41,690
the transporter is screwed up okay right that's one mechanism of cancer but so when this happens

342
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:49,290
on the inside of the body it has a correlation it coalesce and very discreetly process all that

343
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:55,170
information and and into uh into energies and materials that are totally different an example

344
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,010
that would be on a dairy farm and and what comes out of dairy farms you get different cheeses

345
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:07,030
different milk products all from the same cow they say right so this is exactly right so what happens

346
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,710
is one's inside the intestine it's whatever you're eating and as it goes through the wall

347
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,790
there's an intelligence there that when it appears inside the body it might appear as a blood cell

348
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,510
different types of blood cells it might appear as plasma might appear as you know a lymph fluid

349
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,470
it might appear as other type of energy to oversimplify the cow produces milk but it started

350
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,770
by eating grass let's say so the thing is that that's sure sure well let's let's let so that's

351
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:36,970
the induction process so here's the thing the body can also hold that energy from the bologna

352
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,890
margarine sandwich and let's say some bone needs to be rebuilt down by your ankle and it will not

353
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,230
manifest until it gets to the ankle here's one thing i've mentioned before like i like mentioning

354
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:54,030
this again when they look at blood who's they anyone uh with western education no uh they see

355
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,750
a bunch of blood cells in the group those are red blood cells these are white blood cells whatever

356
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,370
whatever right well you know what they don't see that when you look at the red blood cells

357
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,770
this blood cells for the big toe this one's for your ear this one's for your eye they can't see

358
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:13,110
that right imagine they all have serial numbers they all have messages on where to go it's not

359
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,790
this random lump they like to tell people that everything's random right you know it's nothing

360
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,670
as random each cell has a designation point once you once that is understood to read now

361
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:30,010
right if someone needs a new foot you can designate cells to go into the body and rebuild the foot

362
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:35,210
directly right and by the way this technology's existence since the 30s well isn't it but isn't

363
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,250
it because they oversimplified the grouping of things together where they turn around they say

364
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:45,670
well that's just plasma that's not just plasma that's hundreds of different things going on

365
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,990
right well if you want to go to the core of the education financing is involved and the

366
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,870
financers don't want it right okay and they have like for example if you look at the medical field

367
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:02,430
that's a paramilitary group of paramilitary is a fancy way of saying police so when the banksters

368
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:08,070
took over any country they would love to set up another army and get rid of the existing army but

369
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,710
that would put the country in total chaos and the people would never accept it so instead of creating

370
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,050
another military force they create a police force that enforces people certain people that are

371
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,030
allowed to practice medicine certain ways and others are no one else is allowed otherwise you

372
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:28,290
send this paramilitary group to arrest you right so they control this education all this stuff so

373
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,850
that's the problem policy enforcers is all they are the policy enforcers so they develop a policy

374
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,630
and then you well no no they're actually a paramilitary group they're a power see let me

375
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,929
just go over it again when the bankers take over a country they they would the way they say we now

376
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,570
we have our own military your country your military is gone and you have to do what we say

377
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:53,150
you know what the people will do they won't take it that country will will go into a massive massive

378
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,970
real civil war revolution and it will never settle down until they get rid of the banksters

379
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,670
so what they do is they convince them that police are okay which police are just paramilitary

380
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,390
and to prove this you look at things like waco whatever let's say someone has a hostage situation

381
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:16,230
in a suburbs country city and the police show up and the people take the the hostage takers shoot

382
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,630
all the police dead and all that well police say well they killed us all right so now we got to send

383
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,790
armored police and then they blow up all the armored police guess who they're calling next

384
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,970
the nearest military base to send tanks and helicopters right you get it of course yeah

385
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:35,710
waco or whatever else ruby ridge whatever you want to say okay this is so that's where the veil

386
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:41,770
of what i'm saying falls apart you could see it very clearly um that's why there is no information

387
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,630
that's why the information is always held in a non-public scheme or non-public place it doesn't

388
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,770
i mean everything we do is behind a paywall let's say for a reason also because if you have open

389
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,730
audio let's say we do we start getting into more of this stuff even stuff we've gone into and it's

390
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,470
on rumble or anybody could go to the website and click on it and get it no no you'd have some

391
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,810
serious problems you know what i mean right because it's public right uh this is not public

392
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:18,710
right so uh and it's all you know the the um the uh they do these things this is for education

393
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,010
purposes only not advice or whatever bullshit this is more than education purposes and it is advice

394
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,810
well just like just like you said with the terrorism when they say this is terrorism

395
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,210
no it's not it's a drill when they say it's a drill it's actually terrorism sure yeah speaking

396
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,530
of which uh i want to just tell people you know you can learn anything about everything and

397
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,730
everything about anything right you have an unlimited capability storage capability it's

398
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:48,930
how you grew up and the people that you respected when you you were young how they behave you you

399
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:55,550
take on these traits i've seen this many times i've seen it even with my being around as a young

400
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:00,790
man like we go camping or somewhere by the way i don't you know i don't like that but and and there's

401
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:07,150
alpha male and after the camping trip we all start using the terms and the mannerisms that

402
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,090
the alpha male did right we all copy women do the same and all this other stuff so as a

403
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,930
so as a child if you grew up around people that were respected by your parents it might be your

404
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:21,130
parents also might do this older brothers or neighbors that were respected if they say oh

405
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,270
i don't know anything about that and the p and everyone patted them on the back so you're still

406
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,530
a good guy well now you say what was what did he say he didn't know anything about math oh and

407
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,590
everybody still loves it okay so i can go if i don't want to work on math at all all i have to

408
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,930
say is i'm not good at math everybody pats me on the back says oh good boy oh good girl it's

409
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,510
it's acceptable and that's not acceptable because anyone can learn everything about everything

410
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,630
or everything about something or something about everything in other words you have unlimited

411
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:57,330
capability right so when you take all of this and you put it together where i was going with this

412
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:03,950
recently someone sent me there was an explosion of a house okay in arlington virginia and they

413
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,310
asked me what did this because the police said it was a flare and i looked at it and like

414
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,930
before the video even as it started i was like on three seconds i see exactly what happened here

415
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,110
was an oxygen tank that's bolted some down somewhere in the basement and it was blown by

416
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,830
a primary some kind of primary explosion not a spark um and it was in the basement if you look

417
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:30,330
at the thing the explosion how first of all how do i say it's oxygen because it was a bright yellow

418
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:36,250
and then bright orange immediately and any debris that was close by already caught fire because

419
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,330
that's how a calorimeter works when you try to figure out calories you use oxygen because it

420
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,790
has the ability to set everything on fire and we know the color the spread the spectrum of oxygen

421
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:52,230
right so and it wasn't just like a spark starting it doesn't work it was this was a primary ignition

422
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:58,290
like a smaller ignition setting it off like a small explosive a small flare gun could have said

423
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,970
you know tremendous amount right so how did i know this well because through the years

424
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,030
when i saw oxygen being burned the first time maybe at 12 years old someone

425
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,550
turning on a torch when they turned the oxygen on i remembered the color of the flame

426
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:18,570
right right when i heard when i heard oxygen pop i remembered how fast it was so all when i see that

427
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:24,550
when i saw that building the way it went off in the news in the youtube video that was sent to me

428
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:31,810
what i did immediately is recalled anything every experience that i've ever recalled since i've

429
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,150
been on this planet and filtered it all out say what is this and it all was very obvious to me

430
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,210
so why do we know it was in the basement because if you play it in slow motion you see all the

431
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,170
first floor windows blow out horizontally first before it rises right so it was below the first

432
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,510
floor not on the first floor right right so and i gave a detailed explanation how much oxygen it

433
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,250
was the tank had to be bolted down because it wasn't bolted down the it wouldn't have it you

434
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,630
know the it would have propelled itself away and spread it out it wouldn't have been so concentrated

435
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:09,510
right so so this is like very very simple this is a simple you can make any process that you see

436
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,350
recognizable and describable if you focus on everything that you're doing that's why

437
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,870
years ago when i was around the people in the new age movement they always say you're not present

438
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,070
you're not present be here now right that kind of thing that means to be present yeah right

439
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:30,290
you know um how many times have you seen people describe a car accident right and then you

440
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:36,370
question them and you and um you say well that accident was there a lot of broken glass in the

441
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,990
prison see yeah half the people will say there was broken glass even though there was no broken glass

442
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:46,410
right they'll start confabulating because everybody knows it could be broken glass so if i say there's

443
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,810
broken glass it's okay i wasn't paying that much attention right so one of the things that i do

444
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,950
also is learning you know how i say everyone's got a photographic memory is just that most people are

445
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:02,970
out of film right or out of now it would be disk space or your card is whatever right you get it

446
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:08,910
right okay so what you do is uh you know let's say you're a passenger or whatever or you're walking

447
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:14,470
it's something fast moving a bus a train a car you see a billboard with a phone number and you pass

448
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:20,210
it right you may might be in view for a second or two or three take a picture of that billboard

449
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:26,150
while and then read the number when you've already passed it and can you read the number as if it's

450
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:31,650
still in front of you as if you took a picture of it can you do that with your mind yeah and i train

451
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:36,110
people to do this and it first of all i'll never there's a whole bunch of people by the way when

452
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,750
i'll never be able to do that pat him on the back say good boy good girl go get some ice cream okay

453
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,990
who's interested in doing this as opposed to saying right away right you know what i mean

454
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,890
self-defeatist and i train people how to do this and i do it all the time and people test me it's

455
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:56,910
it's like um i gotta pull over and uh did you get that i'm like yeah i'll get that and actually i

456
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,570
you know we just passed it and it's like uh 30 seconds later and i'm still giving him the phone

457
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:04,550
number and all everything that pretty much everything on the billboard right like holy

458
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,330
shit well i said it's not that i remember it what i remembered was that as an image and now

459
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,930
that image fades by the way because it's not that important and i'm reading it

460
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:19,190
to them as if it's still in front of me right and this is a skill and it's very simple by the way

461
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:27,310
all you do is whatever it takes emo to be a camera it's kind of like the idea of not being

462
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:33,330
like a camera there's a big difference between being like a camera and being a camera

463
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:42,470
think of the emo right being like a camera we can't do it but we can create a cartoon effect

464
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,490
that you're in a cartoon scene and you're actually a camera in the cartoon right yeah whatever it

465
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:52,130
takes like a camera leaves a lot of open space to be other things that are not okay and and you

466
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,890
probably won't have the abilities of a camera if you're like a camera right because you can make a

467
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:02,010
lump of clay look like a camera you could look like a camera and have no functionality as exactly

468
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,770
so you want that you want to be a camera right right yeah what is it sorry so now you're getting

469
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:13,210
into that so like we said earlier everything is the same if you look at the atoms inside

470
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,710
a camera and the atoms in your body there's it's all space it's all energy

471
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,010
so that's that's another perspective so anyway keep learning because it's unlimited but the thing
