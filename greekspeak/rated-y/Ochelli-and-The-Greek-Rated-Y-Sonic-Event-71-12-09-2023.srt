1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,820
You got it. What did I do here? Here it is. Okay.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,800
71 is the number for this Sonic episode, but it's not an episode. It's an event. Anyway,

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,880
Sonic event. Well, I did say Sonic episode at first. That's what I screwed up.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,580
So yeah, it's got to be Sonic event shows are for dogs and ponies. And yeah, you get shows all the

5
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,120
time anywhere else. This is not a show like this. Yeah, indeed. It's not episodic by nature anyway,

6
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,340
because it absolutely does not flow that way. We sometimes continue conversations.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,900
It is. I've watched. You think this is episodic? Really? Of course. Yeah,

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,100
I've been watching a bunch of $6 million man from the 70s. And then they don't really one

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,060
doesn't flow into the oh, it's so poorly done. But if you watch those B movie,

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,740
stuff from the 70s, that's how I see the world here right now. So that is so B movie that it's

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,040
actually a refresher to show almost like a punctuation. You know what I mean? Not an

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
annoyance. Well, what's hilarious to me is the only thing I can think of, like, as soon as you

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,160
mentioned that is that that sound effect whenever they were going to show that he was

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,000
that's that whoever did that they had a pretty good handle on that. Yeah, they know what affects

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,380
the mind, right? It's like for now, commercials on television are designed to be more effective

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,680
on the mind if the people tune in and tune them out visually and audibly, whether it was walk away

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
from the TV, they're actually more effective than if you sat there and watched it. It's the way

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
it's structured now. And it's really not expensive to do. I mean, they're still using that silly

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,760
commercial on everything now. Because it was originally a broadcast television commercial.

20
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,740
But the ringing bells, we wish you a Merry Christmas was was a thing for what Hershey

21
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,320
kisses and they would do the thing where the Hershey kisses ring, but they've been playing

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,100
that. No, they got you. I've never heard. I didn't. Yeah, I'm not aware of it. I've never

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,060
know how to pick up. I'm good at tuning stuff out. Well, they stick that on my YouTube. Now

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,700
they stick that on if I go to anything pretty much. Yeah, I got commercial commercial everywhere

25
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,220
now. I don't get it at all. Oh, wow. I've been I've been married 21 years. I know how to tune

26
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:38,500
people out. Trust me. Yeah, I know. So yeah, it's called survival. Yeah. My survival instinct is to

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,520
flee as opposed to adapt, I guess. Yeah, that's that's probably so. And speaking of which,

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,480
it's the quote unquote season. And before we got on, it's like, do you think I'm actually

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,260
going to believe in a text that's held up by a bunch of Catholic pedophiles and a bunch of Jews

30
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,440
that run the publishing industry and all the media? What I mean by that is the cat the Vatican,

31
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,220
okay, you got all these forms of Christianity, it doesn't matter which form, it doesn't matter

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,280
what poop you stepped on, you stepped on poop, if you're right. Yeah, all of them. None of them

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,580
look, the caress guy in Waco that you know why they killed him? Because he was trying to start

34
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,300
another sect of Christianity that just was not approved by the Vatican. That's all they do to

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,400
you. Yeah, it's a branch. The branch Davidian was a literal branch off of another. And this is what

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,440
the problem is, if you try and see, you can go into business if you have a license, but you have

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,100
to have their license, their approval. Otherwise, if you try and put out your own shingle and just

38
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,840
declare yourself to be the arbiter of whatever, it doesn't matter if it's a religion or candle

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
making. If you do it without their permission, they're going to come they're going to come for

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,120
you. You got to you got to pay your taxes, right? Yeah. So okay. Anyway, well, they don't have to

41
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,600
pay taxes if they don't approve of you being in business. But right. So it doesn't matter if you're

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,840
one of those born again, you know, or, you know, they got, you know, the Chick-fil-a, I call it

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,320
chicken sandwiches, right? Oh, yeah. And because they're right. So it doesn't matter. You stepped

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,420
in it. Sorry. It's all right. Now the other thing, when I say Jews, I spell it with a j o o z. Okay,

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,980
so don't tell me I'm anti semitic, because I'm actually, quote, unquote, more Jewish

46
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,740
than they are, believe it or not, because you actually follow their laws.

47
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,900
And what's funny about that, you know, what cracks me up most is that I was reading a story this

48
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,300
week, and I want to throw this at you, because I'm sure you didn't see it. But you won't be

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,100
surprised at all. You've heard of Pornhub, right? I've seen it around. Yeah. Okay. Well,

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,340
I saw it once on a statistic. It's it's like, number like 20. And the if you think go look at

51
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,420
the top 100 websites in the world, I think it's up there. It has to be always right. It has been

52
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,780
like that, like pretty much since its launch. It was like the it has worked out in that industry.

53
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,920
This thing is a long lasting entity. Okay. Funny thing, I just read that the person who purchased

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,820
it recently, is a rabbi. Yeah, of course. And you know, and some people are going,

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,760
well, that doesn't make sense. And I'm going, I think it does. Anyway, you know,

56
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,620
one of its reverse psychology, the way you create population control and decrease the birth rate is

57
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:28,300
proliferation of sexual, not devious, but sexuality in society. So if you use an example,

58
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,580
if you go to very conservative societies, Islam, Mennonite, whatever, whatever, they don't have any

59
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,940
girly magazines or porn at all, openly. But guess if you go to knock on the door, how many kids you

60
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,820
got living here? I got seven. I got nine people that are into the sexualized societies. How many

61
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,120
children have you had one? We're going to we're going to skip that. Or we've been trying to have

62
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,620
a baby for five years. We gave up. How many children have you got to write? You go to the

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,660
ultra conservative countries. No. Oh, 12 children. You have nine children, minimum five. Right.

64
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,400
So you see at least five. Yeah, that's your evidence. Yeah. After four is when you get

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,620
started. So three is where you get started. Four is you actually have. And so so actually,

66
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,660
if you want to decrease the population or lower the birth rate, you increase sexualization

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,500
of the society and you have fewer children. Now, one of the reasons this works so well

68
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,880
is because people don't see it that way at all. Let's say if I have access to girly magazines

69
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,820
and porn and sex toys and all that and we have more to know, it's the ultra conservative societies

70
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,340
that have none of that that have the high. OK, enough with that. Common sense, though, because

71
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,100
look, if you have. OK, let's just assume comes factory. And so I disagree. It's not it's not

72
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,600
common. It's not common. Well, hold on, because you what I'm going to say is you can't assume that

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,280
it comes with this structure as a as as a human, whatever the shape is. It comes with it. Your

74
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,980
sexual stuff comes along with that. Right. Your urges. You need to do this. Your need to reproduce

75
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,440
comes with it now. No, no. But what I'm saying here, Chuck, I'm going to step on you for a

76
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,420
second. It's not common because it's the opposite. In other words, it's kind of like saying this

77
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,640
society has all this food and they're starving. And actually, that's true. Also, U.S. U.S. are

78
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,020
the most malnourished people in the world. But that's a fact, by the way. And they have the

79
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,700
most growing capability and caring capability to supply food. Right. So what I'm trying to say,

80
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,340
right. The richest people are actually the poorest people because it's right because

81
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,460
their credit. Right. If that if the credit notes represent a negative rate, a million in the bank

82
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,860
is minus a million. So it's all backwards. And that's what's uncommon about it. And yeah, but

83
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:50,580
it's not recent. It's like it's occurring always here. Right. You see. OK, so this is the way it's

84
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,040
always been. Is that. Yeah. And a very religious society doesn't mean that what people think it

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,380
means at all. It just means highly controlled, highly controlled, but not repressed, really,

86
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,200
because repression is different than control. Yes. I'm asking. No. OK.

87
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,200
We have to define that further, but I like defining something like,

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,580
oh, I don't know, the most common stuff. I don't think repression is common because remember,

89
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,900
let's take that further. The harshest dictator in the world is also government by the people,

90
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,559
for the people. Right. Just like the bullshit they tell you in the US government by the people,

91
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,280
for the people, by whatever. All governments are like that, no matter what it is,

92
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,680
because the people support them. If it doesn't matter which government it is,

93
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,640
if the people don't support it, it topples. It doesn't matter who it is in history. Right.

94
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,900
That's why the propaganda is really with you. But here's the thing. Well, actually,

95
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,640
without getting into saying here's the thing, politics aside there, one of the things we were

96
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,120
saying is, why did I bring this up? Do you think I'm actually going to believe believe in the in

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,120
the preserved texts? What's in there as such? You got to be crazy. It's going back to the Catholics

98
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,100
and the Jewish Judean community. It's put forward as the Bible. Right. OK. But I do get law from it.

99
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,160
And just like if you read a bullshit thing like the 9-11 Commission or the Warren Commission,

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,900
there's more being said by what's not being said than what is being said sometimes. And what is

101
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,460
being said actually is very highly inclusive if you know how to pick it out. Right. So I still

102
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:43,720
adhere to the biblical text as received as a communication. Right. If that makes a point.

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,920
But the biblical text itself, no, it's I don't believe anything in there as it's presented.

104
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,000
Even the books are out of order. Right. That's easy to that's easy to look up. You know,

105
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,900
they put books out of order. I mean, what your book does for three hundred years,

106
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,620
but it comes back. So it should be chronological. So no. So you have to be extremely discerning.

107
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,920
So we're going into this thing is some people are new. It's called the holiday season.

108
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,480
One of the things when it's brought up, the Christmas thing was brought up.

109
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,820
It's almost 50 percent of the time preface that it's not really the birth date of J.E.S.U.S.

110
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,360
and or no one really knows bullshit. You actually know it to the hour, to the day, to the week,

111
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,020
to the month and to the year by astronomical signal. And that would be found in Red Book

112
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:36,980
Revelation. And that day, let's do it backwards. It's around six o'clock at night on September,

113
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,000
on the day of 11, 3 B.C. Right. So that's why they had that big celebration on September 11th

114
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,700
in New York for him. So anyway, how do we. Yeah, this has been and I was one of the first people

115
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,780
other than Martin, Ernest Martin and someone else in the 1920s figured this out. I forgot his name.

116
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,160
It was one of these biblical scholars. I know this Christmas thing is bogus. We know exactly

117
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,400
according to the text. Now, it doesn't matter if you believe just like according to the text,

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,860
Pontius Pilate was the final authority in the say so. And Pontius Pilate refused it

119
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,760
by even directly refused. But he says, use your law, which is mosaic law, which is death by stoning.

120
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,220
Right. So. Right. So all this stuff now has nothing to do with belief. Do you know? Do you

121
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,900
know how to follow instructions? Now, any communication is a form of instruction. Right.

122
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,020
So it is. OK, when you some people think instructions, it means they have to physically

123
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,340
get into. Yeah, you will eventually. Something like the Bible demands or suggests physical action,

124
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,440
not just literary stuff. Like if you're reading Emerson, Moby Dick, there's not much physicality

125
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,920
you can do. Right. If you're reading something that tells you how to speak, how to think,

126
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,400
how to eat, how to keep time and all this other stuff. Yeah, it's going to it's going to be

127
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,200
an instruction book. Most books are most stuff worth reading is instruction. Oh, instructional.

128
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,400
So and people, by the way, hate that. They don't like they. Right.

129
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Bring out a new device, make up a new device and put an instruction book in there and hand it out

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,240
to 100 people. And I don't think more than three or four people will actually look at the

131
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,700
instructions and follow them to get the device done. Only a very tiny percentage. So it's the

132
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:29,960
correlate again. Yeah. But that's what we kind of got into before we started recording. But what

133
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,780
I wanted to get into was what's in the chat. Got a couple of people with medical jargon or medical

134
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,760
background talking about doing certain things. I don't know if you recall reading the recent

135
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,220
chats, December 6th. Right. Well, I was just looking at them just before we went to air,

136
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,620
actually. And we're not on air, but you know what I mean? Just before we went to record.

137
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,460
And yeah, it's it's interesting what's what's coming up here. Like I said, we went from knife

138
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:04,920
sharpening over to this whole other thing. So it's it's fascinating. Let's see. The whole other

139
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,900
things. Yeah. Whole other things. But what was interesting is someone asked anybody applying

140
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,400
to the ether stuff or Greek speak stuff. Trevor James Constable stuff. I'm paraphrasing here,

141
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,360
Wilhelm Reich and such. And there was no real answer. But I asked, What do you mean? It's crazy,

142
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,300
like it's crazy results. So you can get I'd say I get into an asonic, I probably won't get into

143
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,380
it too much here, because it deserves its own introduction. Fair enough. But the whole thing

144
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,080
was basically another someone else chimed in in the chat, actually, recent comment about rapping

145
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,380
and all that what that's all about. Very simple. We can get probably another sonic, maybe the next

146
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,000
one, we'll get into the details of what was brought up in the chat. But the wrapping is very

147
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,540
simple thing. It's, it's in line with how things are made. Like, you know, Newton's watching the

148
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,500
apple fall, but he's looking up at the tree, he should have looked up a little higher and higher

149
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,580
looked at the sky, because what's really happening is the energies that are way above us are coming

150
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,200
in towards the direction of the earth and compressing things. And when compressing itself

151
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,780
first, and then itself becomes a thing, and then more things are compressed around it, everything's

152
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:25,000
basically hydrogen, compressed in certain energy is, you know, they're looking at the quantity,

153
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,840
you know, how could this element be three hydrogen, how could lithium be three hydrogens? It is,

154
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,940
it is actually, but the way it would put them together, it makes it it's the quality,

155
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,380
it's not just the numerics, the quantum, it's the quality. So everything is being compressed. So

156
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,440
when you compress it, and when you create enough material out of the ether by ether, in winding,

157
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,740
compressing towards itself, then those materials become a factor to create more materials, just

158
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,240
like when you make chocolate chip cookies, you grow the wheat, you make the flour, right, you grow the

159
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,300
sugar, the cane, you make the sugar or whatever, you grow the chocolate plant, you make the chocolate,

160
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,920
right. So and then with these products that are made by making these other things can come together

161
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,820
and make a new thing. And that's what a lot of these elements are, like, for example, platinum

162
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,140
might be considered as the finality of all metals and anything past platinum, gold and all that

163
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:20,880
other stuff is, is when it goes into a half life and decay. Okay, oh, I just gave a secret away

164
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,160
people are more than three sharpened pencils in their pocket, and sitting on a hot plate,

165
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,420
we'll figure it out. But we'll get into that to transmutation sometime. So everything is compression.

166
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,760
So how do you break up things you uncompressed and centrifugal pull them apart.

167
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,960
Right. So living body is under a state of compression in in winding, we say compressing,

168
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,400
it sounds uncomfortable. So in inward energy, when the body soul leaves and the body dies,

169
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,020
the centrifugal force, the outward force takes over the body starts to swell, and you get chemical

170
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:07,200
decomposition, right? Okay, so it's very simple. Now, on another level, on the same vein,

171
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,260
the body is completely contained and sealed. There's an opening a tunnel, like a tunnel through

172
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,380
the mountain. From the mouth to the anus, there is some certain ducts that go into all that direction,

173
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,560
you know, you see a duct and you have some brain that's in the roof of your mouth.

174
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,660
And then you have a cul-de-sac known as the lungs and basically the plumbing that leads

175
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,280
to a lot of the organs like the bladder and other things like that in the eye are basically ducts,

176
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,460
so cul-de-sacs again, right? So basically, something communicates the surface through a

177
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:45,840
duct. So the expansion that we see with a body once the spirit leaves, is not because of the

178
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,960
expansion of the internal pieces, like there's gas that we know the energy, it's purely no,

179
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,580
it's the quality of the energy. So it's like energetic reaction. Okay. Yeah, what is the

180
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:02,400
difference? You can take, you know, a flashlight battery is not included, right? Right? You put the

181
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,119
battery in and the battery is another item, but it's how things are set up. And it's the energy

182
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,200
of the battery, not the battery itself, because you can have a battery that looks perfectly good.

183
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,040
And guess what? It's dead, right? Yeah, right. Gotcha. Okay. So you put it on a scale, it weighs

184
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,540
exactly the same. You measure it, it weighs exactly the same. Okay, feels the same, smells the same.

185
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:31,060
So what's the difference? The energy's gone. Right. Okay. Okay. So, but about this, okay,

186
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,460
the reason why you're bringing this up is because in the chat, they were talking about wounds and

187
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,720
how to deal with them, and you apply compression in one way or another. Yeah, let's give a little,

188
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,620
let's give a little more tidbit, and then that'll be, then we'll get, then I'll structure it so we

189
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,160
can get a little more into addressing, you'll be able to study it, maybe partake a little better

190
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,780
in the, in some of the questions that could arise from the comments that were made. Sure. Something,

191
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,800
one of the things made was ozonating some ferromagnetic material, which is basically

192
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,460
ferromagnetic is like steel wool or wire mesh or magnetite, whatever. Okay. A magnet would stick to

193
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,380
normally, by the way, everything is magnetic, it just doesn't display the reaction that iron does,

194
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,040
right? Because if, if something is really not magnetic, guess what doesn't exist in a physical

195
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,020
form, even a gas. So, so one thing that was brought up there, you know, I guess the ferromagnetic

196
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,620
material ozonated and all that is to induce stimulation and all that. Now, let's just do a

197
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,640
snippet out of Wilhelm Reich. He had this discovery in some of his writings, he included, it's called

198
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,620
bionds. And what that meant was when he took material like quartz, stone, granite, and he's

199
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:49,140
sterilized it, triple sterilized and added some water and some sterile mixtures of like a starch,

200
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:58,200
sterile starch. He noticed that there were small little round blue corpsical cell looking things

201
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,520
that formed around the stone and broke off and became living things off of the sterile material.

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,300
And he called those bionds and it's usually giving off of a slight blue hue. Now, when you have a

203
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,040
general, let's say you have a general condition that you know, you're going to do some Greek

204
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:22,240
speak compression, wrapping and all that. And you're going to incorporate bandages or other,

205
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,140
you know, let's say bandages, right? Because typically that's what you'd be doing and pads.

206
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:34,320
What I suggest you do is after the immediate care, get yourself a pot of boiling water. And

207
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,820
I'm presuming that the bandages are not synthetic material. Most synthetic materials can handle it

208
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,700
and get the water to a simmer. You could have a little baking soda in it or not

209
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,060
and dip your bandages in there. Then ring them out in the boiling water just for a minute or two.

210
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,460
And then dry the ring them out when they cool off and then put them in a plastic bag in the freezer.

211
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,600
So they freeze solid. And when they're frozen solid, let them fall out and put them back in

212
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,780
boiling water. Repeat that process two or three times. So the material that goes from a boiling

213
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,260
water, the bandage to a freezer, back to boiling water, back to a freezer, back to boiling water,

214
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,900
dried off and then wrapped. You could do all that in three hours, by the way, right? Because

215
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,000
a thin bandage will freeze very quickly. Even in a poor rental apartment, freezer will work.

216
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,780
You don't need a medical freezer or something that's highly efficient like what I'm using.

217
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:34,180
So what I would suggest is this will allow the material, even though it's slightly different

218
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,020
from the experiments that showed granite relieving this, all material will relieve it. So the actual

219
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:45,820
bandage itself, once it's formed to the area that you're trying to treat, will start releasing these

220
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,920
bionds after it's been stimulated back and forth several times. And those bionds induce growth.

221
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,600
Tremendously. Okay. Yeah. So, uh, I wasn't aware of this. Okay. This is new to me.

222
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,140
Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, good. Uh, that's, that's the purpose of doing this. So,

223
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,240
so that's a very simple thing. And all this can be qualified by the way, and quantified. If you've

224
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,280
got a good enough microscope, you can see these little things. Of course, if you're looking for

225
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,720
a faint blue light, you shouldn't have the lights turned on all the way, right? You turn the lights

226
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,020
off, right? And once you're lighting the slide, you use a very indirect lighting. Use a mirror.

227
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,940
Don't put a bulb. I find a lot of people still, they, they, they light these devices with a

228
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,140
direct lamp. You want to use indirect lighting, like a mirror, right? Just like the moon mirrors,

229
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,420
the sunlight changes the quality of the light. And we put filters on the mirror. So yeah,

230
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,940
it gets a little more fine tuning, but that's why we do a Greek speak.

231
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:44,040
Okay. And you'll see this blue hue if you do this, because it'll be from the bionds actually

232
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,620
forming. Coming off the material that you're viewing. Yes. And it's very subtle. Depends

233
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,320
on the magnification. I find that anything over 400 magnification is not required, but anything

234
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,100
between 150 and 400 is fine. All right. All right. Well, this is very interesting. And these

235
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,260
encourage growth. So what you're telling me is if you have like, say some damaged skin,

236
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,740
this could assist in the natural repair that occurs. Yeah. Yeah. But look, if you have

237
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,860
breaking your skin and you throw a paper towel on there or something you find under your car

238
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,300
seat from a napkin from McDonald's from three years ago and some electrical tape real tight.

239
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Yeah. That'll work really well to anything. Just you got to tighten it up. Look, let's just finish

240
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,480
this one off. Just on this note, the purpose of the bodies are layer and layers is to allow pressure

241
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,960
mediation between the external environment and the inside of the body. What else does that?

242
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,180
A bicycle tire, a car tire, airplane tire, right? Sure. That is also designed to do the same thing.

243
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,900
The environment, the pressure and conditions inside of a tire when it's inflated is quite different

244
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,400
and then the external environment. And also one of the tires jobs is to keep that pressure

245
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:04,460
contained and maintained. The body's job is to do that as well. Right now, the body also gets

246
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,400
affected by external temperature like the tire does, though, right? Because, yeah, of course,

247
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,540
temperature, humidity, pressure, elevation, magnetism, all that.

248
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,280
And everything that exists contained now, that's an interesting statement there. Everything,

249
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,980
if it doesn't have magnetism, it doesn't exist, which basically means that what you're telling

250
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,380
me is the often ignored characteristic in all things is its magnetic properties one way or

251
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,140
another. It may not be the obvious magnetic properties that we're accustomed to thinking

252
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,620
of as magnetism, where you see attraction between the metal and the magnet, you know,

253
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,220
this kind of thing. Iron, iron, metal, ferrous. We've just been limited to ferrous. Yeah,

254
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,340
ferrous first, which is iron. So yeah, but everything is magnetic. Actually,

255
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,980
even within the stupid academia, they do break it down to paramagnetic, ferromagnetic,

256
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,040
and then diamagnetic, which would be resistant. In order to resist it, you have to provide an

257
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,720
antagonistic energy, which is in the opposite direction, but literally are the same.
