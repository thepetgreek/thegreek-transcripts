1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,920
I'm going to address is wrapping it tight like you recommended if something in the body right let me get into it

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,020
Yeah, you know absolutely we'll just we'll start the recording and say I see those knives now though just so you know

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,460
Yeah, I didn't see that before

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,079
That's pretty nice

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,640
They you know they're pretty unassuming looking actually those are the ones that I bought at Marshall's for 30 bucks for three nights

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,320
Oh, okay, okay, so these aren't really I posted these and then the next day on Monday

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,760
We've got the box with the other knives, so whoever's there's still Japanese in other words

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,320
When I was got the knives someone had already put a knife set for me in the mail

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,480
Before it was already in the mail. I got you. Okay. Yeah, cuz I got it the next day

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,840
Yeah, then it's in the next day

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,060
so

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,380
Yeah, yeah, but these are nice knives. They have they have a poplar handles or wooden handles. I've tried them out

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,260
They're made in the traditional fashion

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,480
mm-hmm

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,300
So

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,080
Nice, okay cool

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,380
For other people that in other words to look up that brand tends to you because you've got Amazon you get a knife for 20 bucks

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,220
and it's Japanese certified steel so

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Hmm cuz I got these three for 30. They were normally 80

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,120
They're not bad, then they're like passable. They're okay. No. They're good. They're good too very good to good

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,940
Yeah, and only 80 bucks top price. That's how I retail 80 bucks

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,460
I got him for 30 if you zoom in on the sticker

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Okay, I

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
Believe you. Let's see. Oh, I can zoom in. Yeah a little bit

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,100
You can control depends on what browser you have. Yeah, you know what it is

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,600
I already have a control scroll. You already have it set for large already. So it kind of rolls scrolls

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,680
Marshall scroll and you'll go up to a thousand percent. Well, I do control plus and it moves it up

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,620
That's who yeah, that's what I was just doing but yeah, I see it now Marshall's and yeah $29.99, right?

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,720
Yeah, Amazon's got even better price for three. Well, Amazon has a better price on just about everything, doesn't it?

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:14,980
And at their point, all right. Yeah, it's actually anti capitalism. We can get it. Let's get started. Yeah, absolutely

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,460
Okay, so as I was saying

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,080
Electrical interference electronic interference

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,920
I've noticed stuff weird stuff's been weird lately and I said that that on that one too. I'm pretty sure

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
Sorry about that

35
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,600
Nasty nasty from the

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,420
tooth anyways, um

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,200
Yeah left down right up and this creates a circular motion and I know we talked about that

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,940
So we're talking about directionality and also what happens. Okay. Yep

39
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah, we just got any I just got an email regarding a manifestation on the left side so, okay great

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,840
So we'll talk about we'll let you lead off with the email

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,220
Well, I also also said I was going to talk about more about the what the decipher. Oh, who was it?

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,380
serum at xeromatics

43
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,240
About the personal injuries and applying on if you read those from a week ago. Yeah, there was a guy with his foot and all that

44
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,860
Yeah, no before that the one with the broken leg. Oh

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,980
Yeah, I'm not gonna get into that detail

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,220
Yeah, you said you're gonna do a solo on that one. All right, no problem

47
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,400
72 looks like and here we are rated Y. All right, so getting right back into it

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,720
I know you got some stuff in your email recently Greek and I know you wanted to address that first. So, uh, go ahead. Oh

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah, let's let's move on. It's it's interesting how it reflects things we did in episode 27

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:07,140
So I wanted to get into also last time we were on I said get more into detail on some of the stuff

51
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,260
So what obviously?

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,880
How uses enough medical jargon that one can say they're in the medical profession or well, we're well exposed to it

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
about healing

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,140
Doing using ether devices Greek speak stuff on the recovery of a broken bone

55
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,540
I think it was tibial fracture and it was more than just a tibial fracture on a distal part

56
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,940
which means further down so or away from the center, so

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,580
I was thinking about that, you know doing it here not necessarily a solo about how to deal with broken bones, but then

58
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,800
What hit me is what reality I

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Walked outside went on a short walk and I ran up to three or four people

60
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm not disparaging the subs or anything

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,440
But I realized no you can't get into this because someone might actually miss a point and do the wrong thing

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,200
Right. So what I would suggest this is not a disclaimer because I do give legal and medical advice, right?

63
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,260
Right. I don't I do because I've never been licensed to do either one

64
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,720
That's what the law says if you've been licensed to do either one and the license is you're no longer licensed for whatever reason

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,740
You can't do it, right, but they charge plenty of people with those crimes or alleged

66
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,800
Misdemeanors or whatever because they don't know the law and by the way

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
I've sat down with attorneys and brought up long like that's not in the law

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,560
They show I said get the books as I know everything in this book and he brings out the book

69
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,900
I show the law I read it. He says wait a second. It doesn't say that

70
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,720
I mean, that's that's the kind of moxie that they have

71
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,820
Even though it doesn't say even though it says that it doesn't say yeah, okay, and it's written in eighth grade level

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,900
It's not even in jargon legal jargon. It's written in plain English. So certain certain laws, but anyway

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,500
What I would say because of the human condition everyone including myself. I might you know

74
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,260
go if you have an injury that is

75
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,040
mild to severe and

76
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,640
It seems like it needs quote-unquote emergency care get it, you know the hospital the doctor, you know

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,000
I was at the doctor like there's one doctor right with no doctor go to a doctor or whatever first get started there

78
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,080
right

79
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,760
Do I do that? No hell no

80
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,860
No way, and I think I mentioned that earlier from a spiritual point of view. Here's the Greek

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,820
He goes to a hospital or a doctor and wait

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,960
He's the one talking against them and give it all these things. What kind of what is he doing or

83
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,320
Here's the Greek. He just passed away

84
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,820
And he the stuff he talked about didn't apply. So what the hell is he talking about?

85
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,320
So either way, you know you lose, right? Yeah

86
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Well, I try to handle most things on my own at home for sure, but on occasion I need another pair of hands

87
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,480
And I figure sometimes if I do need a bone set or something like that

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,160
I'll go get it from you know, the hospital whichever one's nearby

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,960
Something like that if I need right now, by the way

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,020
They're shutting those things down because they've served their function which is financial function purely and they're opening emergency clinics

91
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,160
Which you'll see that if you drive by these little mall strip mall places and it says intensive care urgent care here

92
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,320
You know urgent care now. Mostly that's the biggest phrase. I guess. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and get it

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,320
So the thing that you have to do certain things even a quote-unquote medical person has to get done

94
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,280
This is not like being a lawyer when you sue a lawyer

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,560
He has to get another lawyer how ridiculous it is, right shows you how it's a game

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,940
You know when you have you have a game you have to use the parts that are in the game

97
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,720
You can't right so when a lawyer gets sued or an attorney calling them lawyers is not right their attorneys

98
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,020
They have to hire an attorney to represent them, right? So it tells you has nothing to do with being competent

99
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,440
It's a game. Yeah, so, you know, I think Maxwell talked about it's a court, right?

100
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,840
Whatever well you play games on a court a tennis court a basketball court, etc. It's a game

101
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,700
So basically the doctors now, they often need someone else because of the hands

102
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm fully well-versed and competent in all forms of dentistry and

103
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,840
I

104
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,980
Need a dentist to do it and the dentist that I go to needs a dentist

105
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,840
It's you know, he says he has three root canals in his mouth as you doing yourself

106
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,720
Looks at me sideways like you know, you can't do that to yourself, right?

107
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,980
Well, it's rather difficult to do dentistry to oneself. I mean, let's be honest you you you it's it's a it's not impossible

108
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,559
But it's difficult, right? Yes, you need a community. In other words, that's why I've always said, you know

109
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,500
You go it. Let's say you have a semi loosely knit or a block, you know people or you know in the city in town

110
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,120
Or whatever, you don't know. Hey Jimmy's good with the cars

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,180
He's good at cooking when you do the barbecue bring him this guy's good at boats

112
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,060
This guy's good at fishing go talk to him. This guy's good at carpentry go talk to him

113
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,380
But you notice they never say he's really good at setting bones or this guy's really good with the health stuff in the medical stuff

114
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,020
You don't hear it

115
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,340
so eventually if you're in a loosely knit community or tightly knit community gonna have to

116
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,720
Find out who is good at the teeth at the body at the organs at the bones

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,020
You know all these other things and if guess what you'll probably find out that nobody is because they all say

118
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,960
Oh, we go to the hospital or the doctor, right?

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,880
So guess what you have to do you find out who is most who might be most proficient or is naturally inclined

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,020
Right. Yeah and get them get them some training. And by the way, I dare anyone you just randomly just try to fun

121
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,400
Don't pick something you want to do pick something that randomly in the medical profession just a specialty

122
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,060
Doesn't matter up follow me dentistry a diatribe

123
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:49,020
Whatever, whatever. Yeah, just pick something out of a hat random and then go study it online online courses for doctors or whatever everything

124
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,140
You get and I assure you I assure you in less than 10 days

125
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,500
Let's say podiatrist. You will be able to walk into any podiatrist office and have a

126
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,660
Conversation with the podiatrist and he'll ask you where's your residency? Where's your office because he thinks you're on his level. I'm serious

127
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:12,180
Now obviously it doesn't mean experience but neither does that it's mean a lot because when I had a tooth extraction number 19

128
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,680
about 10-15 years ago, I

129
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:23,340
Know that when a tooth is extracted and there isn't severe decay in the mandible or the skull or the bone area

130
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,680
You have something called a period on periodontal ligaments called the PDL

131
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,860
What basically it's a cushion that when the the tooth whether it's one root two roots three is set into the bone

132
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,980
It's a ligament. It's softer tissue. It acts as a shock absorber

133
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,580
Yeah

134
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,740
When the tooth is extracted if that PDL remains and the socket closes

135
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,680
The body gets a signal that the tooth is still there and there will be decay that could form between the PDL and the closed

136
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
Socket, right?

137
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,380
So what has to be done if the PDL is present or any of the PDL is present periodontal ligament is you need?

138
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,100
Depending on the size of the root, you know number eight number ten number eleven burr

139
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,660
Which is basically a small file in the shape of a ball goes the other drum. They stick it in the socket

140
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,220
It's kind of messy because it's bloody right, right and you have to remove the PDL by scraping it out, right?

141
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,780
If you don't do that, it will never heal properly Hilda Clark cure for all diseases is a book. She wrote about 30 years ago

142
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,640
She's alive in Mexico

143
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I think she recently died

144
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,480
But she they said she died 20 years ago because in Mexico because she was putting out a lot of remedy

145
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,660
Anyway, Hilda Hilda Clark H ULD a Clark. I have her book

146
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,160
Pretty good. Hold on H ULDA. Hold up. Yeah, Clark. Yeah, I believe so. It's a cure for all diseases. It's a good read

147
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,780
She believes in viruses and things like that, but a lot of the practical stuff works

148
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,280
anyway

149
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,400
Where was I going with this? Oh, yeah talked about a lot of people in older age when they

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,480
You find they're in the wheelchair, they can't walk and one of the reasons was when they had teeth pulled

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,220
The socket wasn't cleaned out and they had decay forming in the bone and it eventually caused enough

152
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,860
Nerve debilitation where they couldn't walk in older age older age could be 65 70 80, right?

153
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,880
So anyway, so even at that age they would scan their mouths and find out that the sockets looked hollow

154
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,860
Where the bone is healed over and they would break through and clean it out and guess what after recovering from the tooth surgery within a

155
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:29,620
Few days, they're able to regain the use of their legs again. So one thing you notice so say what is what is an infected tooth?

156
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,460
Socket that's been closed up for 40 years have to do with you being able to walk, right? Yeah, that's all energy, right?

157
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,460
Yeah, so I just give this example, but by the way, I so I asked the the relationship I have with the dentist is informal

158
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,260
So I won't mention his name, but if I call him up and I say he says hey, what do you need done?

159
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,980
Well, you know, I'm number 21. I might need an extraction or whatever and he says, all right. Listen, when do you when?

160
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,460
Can you call me says? All right. Look up. How about we'll meet at the office at 8 o'clock after I play basketball Thursday

161
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,140
That's that's the relationship. I have one right we do a barter, right?

162
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,000
so it's funny I'll sit there and

163
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,400
He'll bring in assistant because it's easier that way

164
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
It's really easy to get assistance by the way, you know

165
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,600
You go to the colleges and they're just dying to get you know, people to sign off that they didn't so many hours, right?

166
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,100
Yep

167
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,080
so if you want someone eight o'clock at night, you call them up and

168
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,680
It'll be an hour or two and you say look I'm gonna sign off that you did 12 hours and oh boy

169
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,340
Are they happy they'll come right really right away, right? Right. So anyway, yeah the whole world

170
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,340
This is how the world works. You will scratch my back. I scratch yours, right?

171
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,040
So anyway, so I mentioned, you know what I want. I think the PDL is good

172
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,520
I want to get an eight. Do you have an eight bird? He goes what?

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,800
Number eight bird I said and I see so I want to clean up the PDLs. He's not the PDL

174
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,980
I'm like, yeah clean out the PDL. So the socket he'll solve, you know, you know completely because I haven't heard that since I was in

175
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,060
College, they're like how many?

176
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,920
Extractions have you done since you've been out of college? Oh thousands. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

177
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,120
Right, so tie this back to the pediatrists the pediatric the podiatrists by the way

178
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,520
Pito and pedo are two different things, right? So yes, anyway

179
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:13,980
Yeah

180
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,460
You will learn enough fresh out of what's let's say memorialized and I don't think that's good

181
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,220
They pick podiatrists because I don't think they're going to it's like pathology where they totally destroyed that field

182
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,360
Online and oncology which oncology is totally useless. Anyway, all right

183
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,560
You know, so podiatry podiatry is a very practical thing because a lot of people have trouble with their feet

184
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,140
I mean, it's one of those things that's constantly in use and damage occurs

185
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,040
It's called cheap shoes. Yeah cheap shoes, you know, right? So go ahead. I mean, it's just it's a very practical

186
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,040
Thing I was thinking just like dentistry. Yeah. So in other words after after 10 days to a month, let's say

187
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,320
You will be able to operate in that field

188
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,220
Believe it or not technically

189
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,720
practically

190
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,880
So what do you say?

191
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
No, I agree

192
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,500
I mean look I was able to in I can tell you from personal experience

193
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,400
It took me about a month

194
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:15,940
I would say of really reading but I did find having conversations with all sorts of people in the x-ray field x-ray technicians

195
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,380
No problem. It took me about a month to pull it together

196
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,560
To be able to have discussions so I could accurately

197
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah, and x-rays are like in code

198
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,500
You need someone who knows how to read them

199
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,080
Most doctors will stand there staring at it for hours and told the guy who knows how to read x-rays has brought it

200
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,680
Yeah, the doctor never reads him the doctor reads the report from the technician

201
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,940
Is what the doctor reads and that's what they go on usually, you know

202
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,740
Normally, so I wanted to know what the technicians knew. So I just grabbed their textbooks. I went through it and I went

203
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,660
Okay, this is what?

204
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,300
You know, this is what I mean. I don't recall all this off the top of my head now

205
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,960
Cuz this is probably about 20 years ago

206
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,460
And I haven't had to use it much

207
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,400
Since that's another thing, but I don't use something like that

208
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,380
You know, I don't access it as quickly and easily but I mean if I've just recently read it obviously

209
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,540
It's more fresh in my mind and I can utilize it a lot better

210
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,560
But back to the podiatry thing. I mean that's a common issue, right you get older

211
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,960
You might have had injuries that didn't heal properly

212
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,960
You know the common old complaints of corns and this and that right?

213
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,180
You don't take care of your feet you're gonna have issues

214
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,960
I mean, it's just right but once the bones form that way and they don't form back they can continue if they continue growing

215
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,900
They'll go back but the part that grew in the way it did will not will not change right? So with that said I

216
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,440
Would suggest going back to the first emergency situation in the case in the chat the person who listed the various things that they did

217
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Seemed pretty okay

218
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,800
There was mentioned something about two pine boards and all that I would have something more flexible

219
00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:00,560
Because if if you're tying something to the bone to keep the bone aligned it should not be as hard as bone

220
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,140
Wait a second. Does that make any sense? Yes, it does

221
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,400
because

222
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,670
There's an energetic value to these things as well. So you want it to be as hard as bone or

223
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,420
Not as hard as bone, but not harder than bone or stronger than the bone. There is a tiny amount of flexibility

224
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:25,079
That's necessary still for circulation and other things like that within the broken area, believe it or not

225
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,680
The other thing I wanted to bring up when you have a broken bone

226
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Have you ever heard of people dying because they had a broken leg and it wasn't treated?

227
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,560
It's rare, but it happens and why does it happen? I'll give you the chemical reason why yeah, I read

228
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,540
I want to say I read about that more in the

229
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,520
1960s seemed to have occurred a bit more for some odd reason right where there were people what will happen

230
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,960
You know how they say blood is produced in the bone marrow it's not

231
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,560
Right only under severe conditions. Well, this is a severe condition. What happens is the blood that's

232
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,640
Produced in the bone marrow when the bone is completely broken is overloaded with potassium

233
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
And the potassium let me just without getting into much of it because I don't have direct experience

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,420
Seeing anyone go through this or the laboratory clinical experience

235
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,940
But what I would suggest is the flood of potassium rich extra rich

236
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,760
Enriched potassium blood short-circuits the heart muscle

237
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,920
right and

238
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:30,600
Then you have they can't start it again. Okay, once it once it's short-circuited with potassium and it's a type of organic potassium

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,880
It's extremely strong. So it's a salt basically. So enough. So what I would suggest also

240
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,580
with a broken bone is

241
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,800
Potassium is formed in the body with from sodium salts basically high quality salts and activity

242
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,660
You must have activity if you're sedentary all sedentary people have potassium deficiency guaranteed

243
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,040
Guaranteed does it by the way intake of potassium as a supplement is worthless?

244
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,840
It just goes right out the body body looks at it says, huh? We don't we make that we don't need it to induce that right?

245
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,160
So the reason you have a lot of problems with people that are sedentary is they have a high sodium or sodium intake no activity

246
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,780
The body produces potassium too much potassium now that it creates a potassium deficiency

247
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,980
Right. Okay, because the potassium is still not at the level that it should be because you need the activity

248
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,280
Right and you're depleting salts at the same time. So yeah, so don't be sedentary the other thing about

249
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,180
Having a broken bone is the problem of being sedentary

250
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,700
It is a certain amount of request and sleep therapy

251
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,620
By the way, if you do sleep therapy with broken bones you recover much faster

252
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,220
But there's only so much sleep therapy. You can do one popular treatment in the medical community is

253
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,680
to

254
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,580
Induce sleep therapy like some older people can't swallow and they literally can choke

255
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,140
So and if that gets if they get an emergency like that

256
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,920
They bring them into the hospital and they induce a coma for a week for them to recover and other things

257
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,320
Yeah, right gunshot wounds are typical

258
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,940
Severe traumas they induce a coma

259
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,360
Which is basically sleep therapy, which is not good because to get sleep therapy you must cycle in and out of sleep not a coma

260
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,000
Again, you'll have the potassium problem

261
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,400
Wow, how did we go down this road?

262
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,780
The I've made the decision to not get into a lot of specifics, but I will get into some specific accounts. How's that?

263
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,160
Okay, that sounds like a good way to go because I'll give us some examples. Yeah

264
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,380
Someone who's probably here it will hear this. Yeah

265
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll recap this recount the story

266
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
We talked about ginger

267
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,500
Therapy and a few other things and just remind me about this because I'm gonna I'm gonna stop this right here

268
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,520
it's not a tangent and I'm gonna go to the

269
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,620
email

270
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,200
was which was someone who

271
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,700
Discussed he has you know, someone who has a sore on the back of their left leg back

272
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,440
Left leg and it's getting worse. What do you do?

273
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,600
They did mention that they had applied pressure. Like I said, right, okay

274
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,300
Okay, so I'm bringing this up at the same time that I brought up the ginger therapy

275
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,200
When you have an open sore that actually something that develops and then bursts through the skin comes through the skin

276
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,600
It's very different than having a cut

277
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,320
Where it's from the outside in

278
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,700
When something comes to the skin and wants to go out it's from the inside out it needs to do that

279
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,360
So you don't want to wrap it tight

280
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,780
Right, right. Now if you have a cut that's from the outside in like puncturing the tire you do want to wrap it tight

281
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,120
Well, okay

282
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,700
So even if you're if you're developing something like, you know

283
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,480
One of those little pus sacks under the skin there the obvious thing is what do you usually do you get the pus out?

284
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,820
Okay, let that stuff go out

285
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,740
Then blister breaks

286
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,700
Yeah, then wrap it tight. Yes, if something wants to come out facilitate that coming out

287
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,360
Something. All right, and then it's treated like a normal puncture which then

288
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,920
Right once it's once it's empty, right once it's once it's empty or yeah

289
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,300
Yeah, where that cycle is completed and it's got to be sometimes

290
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,160
Let's say you have a pus thing you you open it up and you and you believe in the end the pus comes out

291
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,120
You do a wrap not too tight and check it the next day if there's more pus guess what you're not done yet

292
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,880
Yeah, you got to let it out some more

293
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,680
In other words, you got to make sure that it stops producing new stuff to pack into it to push out or right?

294
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,360
Yeah, exactly. Once it's done ejecting then you treat it as a cut. So this is a first time

295
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,260
I've mentioned when not to wrap tight

296
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go back to the ginger thing when something wants to come out of the body

297
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,960
And it's below the skin level dermal epidermal a ginger compress will accelerate that

298
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:05,300
You grate some ginger or sliced ginger. Don't boil it simmer it hot and a clean white towel washcloth type size

299
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,420
Ring it out. Keep hot as hot as you can take it, which would be in the hundred and twenty two hundred twenty-five degree range

300
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,180
Over the area for twenty minutes at a time and cycle it how many cycles it's up to you

301
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,140
Right how much time you by the way people I've read it someone says I don't have any time. I have very little time

302
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,340
It's like oh my gosh. I

303
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,200
Take that it's like you don't have a lot of time for me and someone else or is that just something that you keep repeating?

304
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh my gosh, it's just I think people are getting more and more insane, right? Yeah, so

305
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,740
So so anyway, I just want to throw that in there. Of course. So so the ginger thing

306
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,940
So here's a this person is listening most likely. Okay, and it's okay. I'm not gonna mention names, but it's a sheet and

307
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,980
I don't say this often and I don't say this lightly, but when I say I have a lot of respect for this

308
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,200
Human person right woman. I can't say it anymore

309
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,460
All right. Okay, and you'll find out why

310
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:11,520
There was a bump on the breast right breast, which means it's the energy of the going up. So the so this is very yin

311
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,360
Right upward energy that wants to come out if it was on the left

312
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,240
Mm-hmm. It would also be yin, but it's a blockage versus a coming out, right?

313
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,360
So bodies forming a blockage if it was on the left, but if it's on the right, it means it wants to come out

314
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,820
so they proceeded with the

315
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:38,500
Ginger and it came close and went to the doctor and they of course, you know the c-word, right?

316
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,680
They came closer and closer to the surface surface got black and blue and itchy and red and black and blue and itchy and very

317
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,940
Very close to the surface and the closer came the surface the harder it got wasn't something that's going to go through the skin

318
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,720
Okay

319
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:01,300
She lives in California and she went of a little more than walking distance to the Pacific Ocean early in the winter morning

320
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,120
Spent time in the water in the winter Pacific Ocean till she was completely numbed out

321
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,960
walked home

322
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,320
Put a mirror on the floor knelt down took about three swigs of tequila

323
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,980
Got a very sharp blade because it was on the underside of the breast

324
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,740
Now I'll continue cut it open and

325
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,720
Pushed it out

326
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,060
Okay, and wrapped it up and all that and they're fine

327
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,460
Right. Okay now

328
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,320
now that is

329
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,660
balls or

330
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,460
Vagina, however, you want to put it right because I think vaginas are tougher than balls know whatever it takes to yeah

331
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,860
Explain that this is something that takes, you know bit of strength to do good. Yeah, think about it

332
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,540
That's like stuff you see in film

333
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,740
like like

334
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,560
Fellini movies, you know

335
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,600
So I just wanted to share that people in a certain age might think back to Rambo stitching himself up in a canyon

336
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,260
You know during the first first blood movie, right? Yeah, and that's you don't have to actually no one cities themselves up

337
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,520
They wrap it tight. No, but it's the example. Yes jumping right in and doing it. Yeah

338
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,800
So here's something about you don't need someone else, but you do but you don't

339
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,720
Right, so I wanted to bring that up now

340
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,000
When something like that on the body

341
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,100
Occurs the right side is where the energy goes up on the left side is when the energy goes down and just because you have

342
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,020
manifestation on the right

343
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,820
Doesn't mean it's the opposite of a manifestation on the left

344
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,580
Because you have two things

345
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,980
That could happen on either side one is that something needs to be ejected because it is of that quality

346
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,460
So if it is something on the right

347
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,540
Manifestation happens whether it's in the organ on the skin or breast or head

348
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,240
It's something that has to come out

349
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,480
or the body is forming an abnormal tissue to block too much of the opposite energy of

350
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Energy going down now the same is true for the left

351
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:15,460
When you have an manifestation on the left, it could be too much of the energy that goes down normally wants to come out

352
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Or it could be in a formation of abnormal tissue to block too much of the stuff that should be on the right

353
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,140
That's spilling over to the left. So you have to determine that right?

354
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,700
So this one for example going back to the leg a sore on the back of the leg

355
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,780
Versus the side or the front of the leg

356
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,260
Right, and it would tell me that that is a young discharge

357
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,360
But it's because of young and mean

358
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,640
What would I mean about that? Let's make it simple. Yeah

359
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,600
Young a young discharge would be too much animal product animal fat animal proteins is

360
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,600
Young, but if it was on the front or the inside or the outside of the leg

361
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,540
It would be purely young and to I would say too much animal fat too much animal product

362
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,620
Most likely bovine or pork or four-legged animal

363
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,140
Right most likely but because it's on the back side of the leg

364
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,980
It doesn't mean that it's not young. Yes it is

365
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,520
But it's also you mean so meaning here and you'll this when I say this it'll hit home

366
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,880
Yes, because it's on the left on the bottom

367
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:33,460
It's too much animal product, but it's too much animal product that has chemicals in it like hormones drugs in the meat

368
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,740
Okay

369
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,160
Which are very yin

370
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,010
chemicals are yin, right so into this person by by the location of it and

371
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:52,640
Specific location on the back of the left is telling me there's too much animal product of low quality animal product typically

372
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:00,220
American factory farm product or right so bovine hormones growth hormones

373
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,900
antibiotic chemicals

374
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,220
Pesticides

375
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,680
Kovat vaccines, whatever whatever whatever so if this person ate only organic meat

376
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,380
It would move to the side inside of the leg or the front of the leg

377
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,200
It's not funny

378
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,000
Right if they start eating organic, but it would still be there because they're eating meat

379
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,620
Too much animal protein and it could be too much animal protein from years ago

380
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,260
That the body says I'm tired of it just like a relationship you could be in a relationship 5 10 20 30 years

381
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,360
And one day you wake up and you start it. That's enough

382
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,120
Mmm, right, okay. You have a divorce or whatever, right? Well, you've heard of that

383
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,940
Yeah, no, absolutely. I and then they become really good friends and then some people turn around and remarry again

384
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,560
It's a weird thing. But um, right in this case, it depends on the age of the person, of course

385
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,940
but let me just continue sure good a

386
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,560
Manifestation on the left leg means it's the energy going the down. Is it something?

387
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,880
Abnormal tissue the body is developing to block the opposite yin energy

388
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,000
No, it's because it wants to come out and he says it's actually starting to smell putrid

389
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,780
But it's on the back of the leg. So it means it's more yin. The front is young the back is yin

390
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,000
So that means that it's low quality meaning chemicals mixed in with the meat

391
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,900
Now if you're eating pork or beef or that kind of formula in America, do you think there are chemicals in it?

392
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,420
Of course guaranteed, right guaranteed. Yeah now what set it off?

393
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,220
Is the condiments now, there's a smell

394
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,160
The smell that's coming out is not the animal it can be and I'll get into that

395
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,520
Briefly, it's the condiments that are being used

396
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,960
With when they're eating that ketchup mustard spices Lowry's seasoning

397
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,760
That's a typical one. I mean whatever a steak sauce

398
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,580
Whatever right you condiments, right?

399
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,160
Mayonnaise with the meat with the meat taken with that meal is what spurred it off. So here's one example

400
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,440
I've experimented this if the person continues to eat what they're eating and they just removed all the condiments and spices

401
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,520
The smell would go away. Hmm, and it might shrink a little bit

402
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,700
Hmm, do you see the logic behind this the reasoning? Okay, let's go something that I don't think I brought up

403
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,680
I was going to bring up I went off on a tangent

404
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,840
Well a little something I just want to clarify real fast because it went by so quick I

405
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,380
Noticed okay, I get the left and right difference

406
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,540
But I was gonna ask about the front and back difference and then you addressed it

407
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:40,660
So could you make that a little more clear please? Because yeah, the front is young and the back is mean always

408
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,920
I've dubbed the bottom. Yes. Okay the bottom. Yes, because your body knows which is front which is back

409
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,300
Right. So for example, it's even in behavioral study

410
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,420
When you shoot someone when you're facing them

411
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,620
It's very forceful and when you shoot forward from the front of their if you shoot the front of their body

412
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,000
But if you shoot them in the back, it's considered very cowardly. Yeah, right, so

413
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,180
Cowardliness is Ying

414
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,680
Forcefulness aggressiveness is young

415
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,140
Again, even if we even with this methodology even works in behavioral studies

416
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,480
Okay and cultural studies, it's interesting

417
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm gonna start saying mean more than mean yin whether I'm gonna drop the why

418
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,400
Okay, sure and just say yin because that's more proper yin and yang. So

419
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,820
Yang is forceful

420
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,020
concentrated

421
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,460
Focused bright yin is scattered soft

422
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,640
unfocused

423
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,880
Right. Okay now in order for food to be

424
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,580
Used by the body it has to become mean all food is yin and within all food you have the yin and yang

425
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,340
but once you take the food a

426
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,680
Certain amount that yin is converted to yang to protect the body because when you are taking in food

427
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,100
Which is always yin you need to take in yin

428
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:08,600
it nourishes the body and also and it gives you energy and the quality of energy and also a certain amount of that nourishment that

429
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,660
you take in is to

430
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,780
Protect the body replenish the skin maintain the bones give you strength. That's what I mean by protection, right?

431
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,420
Right. Okay replenish

432
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,820
The yang protects the yin

433
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,960
Always and when you lose the yin the last thing you can keep losing yin the yang is the last to go we talked about

434
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,740
that with people thinking that

435
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Someone who's terminally ill is gonna have a speedy recovery

436
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,300
Because they got up and they looked like they were gonna be fine and then they died an hour later

437
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,820
Because all the yin was leaving while they're in bed

438
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,000
But the last hour when the yang leaves yang is very bright and focused the person looks very bright and focused

439
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,440
They'd get ready to come home, but then they die. Yeah, cuz they've actually let go of the heavier energy. Anyway, they've let go

440
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,340
Yes, yeah

441
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,980
Let go all the nourishment and all the life force. The last thing is the protection just like when you buy something a bubblegum

442
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,940
Eat all the soft yin stuff and the last thing you throw away is the wrapper, which is hard and thin, right?

443
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,780
Right the wrapper is the last thing right that's considered it's tossed so

444
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,679
When you're whatever eating on the go, let's say so

445
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,900
Yeah

446
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,800
So the you buy a hamburger wrapped in paper. The paper is the young part. The hamburger is the yin

447
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,380
But within the hamburger, there's even young and within the wrapper. There's even young right, right, right

448
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,460
So the protective aspect of the wrapper is young, but once you spread it out, you'll see how far it spreads out

449
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,219
That's very yin

450
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,340
It's amazing how it's just it has nothing to do with polarity by the way a lot of people mistake this is polarity

451
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,940
It's not polarity. It's antagonism

452
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,219
But not antagonism in a social behavioral way, but antagonistic in an energetic way

453
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,060
When something is too hot like an end you need a coolant system

454
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,820
When something gets too cold, you need a heating system to maintain a certain degree of life

455
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,080
This is the level of antagonism that I'm talking about. Okay, so

456
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,380
To go back to when I give another example someone has a brain tumor and it's in the middle of the head

457
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
So it's both left and right

458
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,020
And that means it's extremely yin because the top of the head is the most young part of the body, right?

459
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,260
It's the most focused. It's the highest part right the hardest part, right?

460
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:29,680
Noggin, right top of the noggin all the way at the top of the skull in the center by Camrille fissure area

461
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,420
It was more on the right side of it, but still

462
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,640
You know, anyway a lot of yin energy chemicals severe severe radiation will cause that to

463
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,820
That severe radiation internal ionization

464
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,840
Let where you get other things, but yeah exposure to frequent radiation and severe yin chemicals more than any sugar

465
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,780
See if you have a lot of sugar in your diet, which is yin

466
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,240
It'll decay the spine before it goes and builds a tumor in the head

467
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,400
But when you have a tumor in the head like that

468
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,120
It can go away if you have a just basically a grain based diet with some legumes and sea vegetable

469
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
But if you wanted to address

470
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,760
That because you have a brain tumor its energy too much yin ran up to the most young part of this

471
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,300
So the yin energy will run to the most young part of the body to make balance

472
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,220
The young energy too much young energy will run to the most yin part of the body to make balance, which is the feet

473
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,440
That's why you see very common

474
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,880
A lot of Americans over 50 if you see them in the summer like for their calves are dark red

475
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,240
They have sores on the lower part of their legs very common. There's swollen ankles and things like that, right?

476
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,560
Okay, all of those people eat excessive animal all of them

477
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,340
you'll never see anyone who's vegetarian eat that eat except for now the

478
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:52,660
The problem with the everyone going vegan is they don't understand the energy. They just think as long as it's not animal

479
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:58,520
I'll eat it and they eat the strangest combinations of stuff and then also remind me that dry skin too, right?

480
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,360
The dry skin comes along with that too

481
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,220
Okay, and dry skin is too much oil. Yeah, it could be too much vegetable or protein if it's just dry skin

482
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:13,620
It's too much oil and it could be vegetable oil too. But if it's dry skin and it flakes like eczema then it's animal protein

483
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,000
Right like dandruff is animal protein, right

484
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,100
So but it's an animal protein again processed animal so

485
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,220
Like processed would be you like eating Mexican food and the tacos are always cooked with lard

486
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,080
So you're not eating the pork, but you're eating the lard, right? So that would be dandruff. Yeah, okay

487
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,180
Okay

488
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,620
so

489
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,800
the brain tumor

490
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,740
have formed because too much yin extreme yin ran to the most extreme young part of the body with most yin part of the

491
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,300
Body is the bottom of the feet. The most young is the top of the head

492
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,100
So if you want to address that with a sledgehammer right away

493
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,140
we need to give something that is a

494
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,920
Biologically occurring substance or animal or plant that is very young and then make it even more young and administer it

495
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,240
So well, how what would we be now? We know that for example the most yin energy

496
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,480
That we know of is radiation gamma x-ray all that stuff, right

497
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:25,060
So what animal can take the most radiation is a joke about this since the 80s remember with the Russian was supposed to go

498
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,140
Reagan was gonna have his finger on the button, right?

499
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,380
And everybody was talking about this joke that the only thing that'll be alive after nuclear the roaches right cockroaches

500
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,520
Yeah, take they could take a lot of radiation, right? Yeah, are they technically an animal though?

501
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,940
I mean, I've always had that weird thing about insects insects or animals. This isn't it. This is extreme cases

502
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,900
I'm not saying you should do this, but this is the thinking behind it. Okay

503
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,580
So you have extreme mean so you have to balance it with extreme young. So that you take cockroaches now, they're not young enough

504
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,700
Because we want it we can they're young. They're gonna plenty young. Sorry

505
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,240
But can we make them even more young?

506
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,940
Yes, we take them and we carbonize them. We put them on a cookie sheet at 500 degree oven until they turn black

507
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,460
And then we grind them up and put them in a capsule and the person takes three capsules in the morning three capsules in the

508
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,240
afternoon and three capsules at night

509
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
Or actually three capsules in the morning through capsules in the afternoon even just don't do the ones at night

510
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Okay, and within two weeks that brain tumor is almost diminished to nothing

511
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,000
Really?

512
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,100
Yeah, now you the thing is to borrow you notice

513
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,380
I didn't say find what chemical is young because chemicals are processed and removed from their original condition

514
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,960
The thing about applying what I'm saying is finding things that are naturally occurring

515
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,540
Yes, there you could find chemical substances made in the laboratory industrial byproducts that are more young than that

516
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,920
But it's not naturally. It doesn't have all the energy

517
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:57,120
Of a living thing living thing meaning plant animal right plant or animal, right?

518
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,720
Well, that was my argument with the iodine people were getting into, you know

519
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,380
Making sure they had plenty of iodine around and I'm going no that's not the way to do it with the extracted iodine

520
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,820
What you got to do is find something that has it in it

521
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:14,180
You know, well that the idea behind that is replacement therapy that if you load up on the iodine, you won't take the radioactive

522
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,400
But that's not true. It doesn't work that way either right, right?

523
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,340
It's it apparently works that way enough

524
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:28,780
But if you look at the full experiment, it doesn't really work either because they remember they practice exclusions. They will tell you

525
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,960
We tested this and it worked like that in this experiment

526
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
But they won't tell you they tried it on a thousand people only 20 of them that worked right? Yeah, they'll exclude the other right

527
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,540
They only tell you what were it right? So it's big exclusions 20 successes

528
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,220
Yeah, that's a lot. Yeah. All right. Well, you tried it on nine a thousand nine hundred eighty didn't work

529
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,060
It didn't do any inconclusive usually it's inconclusive. That's how we either they could go either way like with the sugar pills

530
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,960
Alright, so what do I mean by that?

531
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,920
So what do we let's go back to the person with the sore on their leg on the back, right?

532
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,320
Well, first of all

533
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm a type of person that would always tell someone let's just go this way. Let me just preface this

534
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,340
If someone is eating McDonald's, well, that's all they eat. By the way. I have run into people like that back in the days in New York

535
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,000
Right. I'm gonna

536
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,860
You want to get them on a healthful diet?

537
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,840
Good what no I met a guy recently and I was a little surprised

538
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,280
It's like that's all he eats is stuff like that like out of a bag out of a drive-thru constantly and I'm like wow

539
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,800
I don't even know. Yeah, you're still here. Okay, the condiments will get him first

540
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,060
I mean, well, it will tip them over is the condiments by the way

541
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,920
You know, it's like the let you win a glass when something flows over the top

542
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,920
What you notice flowing over the top is what was already the last thing that was up there, right?

543
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,400
So when people get these bodily

544
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,780
Discharges it's the thing that pushed it over the top that comes out first

545
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,120
Mm-hmm

546
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,260
So when someone has a sore and it's not it'll probably end up smelling like a condiment that they're one of their favorite condiments ketchup

547
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,000
mustard mayo

548
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,500
Blowery seasoning something like that very much

549
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,740
So, you know, I'll get into why and I think I have if you understand the difference between chlorophyll and hemoglobin

550
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,940
You'll see what I'm talking about

551
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,500
There's only one thing that's different between chlorophyll and hemoglobin and that's another question

552
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,440
Okay

553
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,300
And the body turns chlorophyll and directly into hemoglobin simply by inside of the chlorophyll is a magnesium atom

554
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,640
And the identical molecule is hemoglobin, but the only difference is that magnesium is not there. It's an iron atom instead

555
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:40,340
so the body turns chlorophyll into hemoglobin by transmuting the magnesium in the chlorophyll into iron and

556
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,560
I will get we'll get into how that's done by the way because you can do it at home. I mean on a science experiment

557
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,600
Biological and the one lot of diseases are when the hemoglobin in the body turns back to chlorophyll in the bloodstream

558
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,260
Which is very toxic by the way

559
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,620
Well, it forms tumors and lymphomas and things like that

560
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,760
And it is possible in an instant for iron to go back to magnesium if the conditions are correct

561
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,240
This sounds crazy, right because it's not taught

562
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,240
So anyway, let's go back. So what do we do?

563
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,000
So let's say someone eats McDonald's all the time and you want to get them on a grain diet organic food

564
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay, most most cases. Oh, what's wrong with you eating that bag food? You gotta stop that and eat. Well

565
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,600
Always right now what I would say is go ahead you McDonald's we're gonna try something

566
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,240
But this is how I'd like for you to try it

567
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,740
In your in-between time

568
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,780
I want you to get a pressure cooker make some brown rice and get some

569
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,600
Veggies and stuff like that when you come home tonight with your bag dinner or a bag lunch

570
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,340
Do me a favor and just put a little side plate of that rice and vegetable and have it with your McDonald's

571
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,740
Have some of it. Make sure you eat some of it

572
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,920
Right. So how's it been going there for a week? Yeah, I've been eating some of it

573
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,240
Yeah, and then you know, okay good. So what do you get?

574
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,120
All right, don't get the french fries eat your you know

575
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,760
Cut back right and then eat more of the rice, right keep eating the McDonald's two weeks later

576
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,220
Keep eating don't get the triple burger get the double burger and eat more rice and you see transition

577
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:21,000
Gradual changing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, keep doing what you're doing, but just introduce because most people want to change it. Oh

578
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,420
Austerity I'm gonna lose it. No, just keep doing what you're doing

579
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,380
Just introduce the new thing in addition to and then you start decreasing one

580
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:39,060
Increasing the other right is you don't get the withdrawal that way you don't get that right very smooth transition

581
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,640
Okay phase it out kind of like what they tell you to do it and people do that with coffee

582
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,960
I don't know why they do it with coffee, but they do it with coffee where they phase the coffee out, you know

583
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,460
Yeah, dude

584
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,220
so you if it's the caffeine that's bothering you get the regular coffee and get the decaf and then

585
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,480
Instead of just three cups of coffee

586
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,720
Do two cups of coffee one cup of decaf right and then the next day or next week or next month do

587
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,260
One cup of coffee two cups of decaf and then another month

588
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,600
You're just on the decaf and now you can pretty much switch over to tea or right

589
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,180
Red bull. Yeah, whatever. It's not a shock. Yeah, but it's not a shock. Yeah. Yeah

590
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,680
Seven and seven at seven in the morning. Anyway

591
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,080
Anyway

592
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,980
Transition so okay back to the leg with the left. Yeah and the sore on the bottom on the back

593
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,960
Go ahead do what you're doing. I would diagnose that very simply

594
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,840
Conditionally without knowing this person as animal that is bought from a regular supermarket that is tainted with hormones

595
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,000
chemicals

596
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,500
pesticides by the way

597
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,680
when I say pesticides you'll find a lot of

598
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,540
Pesticides in meat not because they're spraying the cows with pesticides because the food that the cows are eating is loaded with pesticides, right?

599
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,760
right the growth, okay, so

600
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,940
What I would suggest is immediately start introducing these three things mint tea with golden seal and echinacea

601
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,060
If you can go to an herbal shop where they sell these things in bulk you walk in it smells really good

602
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,360
It's kind of earthy crunchy

603
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,220
Earthy place and they have jars and the jars have labels and it's in bulk and you take it out and weigh it

604
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,980
That's the best

605
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,240
We have a place here called aqua Vita that has just rows and rows of stuff that when I was in LA

606
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,960
I couldn't find the stuff that was here in Tucson. I was like fuck LA, you know

607
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,800
They don't have anything there. So anyway

608
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,200
You'll find them in Manhattan you'll find it in places like, New Mexico

609
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,560
the town, you know a lot of like Santa Fe or

610
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,680
Dallas

611
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,020
Silver City places in Colorado

612
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,120
Places we got a lot of these earthy crunchy types, you know what? I mean the earthy type the you know

613
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,800
Some places they might combine it with a vitamin shop to where they got the vitamins

614
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,880
But then they got a yeah in a little section, but then they have all the natural jars

615
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,920
Barefoot women with unshaved legs with hemp skirts and rope bracelets and anklets

616
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,740
Right with hairy armpits that that kind of place

617
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,940
Hempskirt and a rope necklace a necklace

618
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,860
Yes, exactly, right. Those are the ones yeah, you got okay

619
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,020
Okay that you see them run flying around and walking around just probably one of these shops nearby

620
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:25,060
There you go, right? Otherwise, you could find a golden seal echinacea mint

621
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,340
Maybe someone already put this together. Why?

622
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,260
right, those are

623
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:36,520
Antiseptic and they're mid-growth, but they're very yin. So what I would recommend for the left

624
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,680
Back is a yin treatment, but with a quality yang

625
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,660
the quality yang

626
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,200
would be

627
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,720
something like umeboshi plum

628
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,400
if you can get it make a

629
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,220
a

630
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,700
Kuzu K uzu which is a root starch. It's like cornstarch

631
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,360
But it's much better than cornstarch

632
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,240
You thicken that what's in some hot water and you put some plum in there and drink it

633
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,780
another if you don't want it if you don't have access to that a

634
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,200
Quality yin would be a parsley tea

635
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,800
Get yourself a bunch of parsley, you know when I say bunch they sell them in bunches for 57 cents at Walmart. They're fine

636
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,320
And and throw it in a pot boil to bring the water to a boil with a pinch of salt turn the water off

637
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Throw the parsley in there put the lid on the next day

638
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,060
You open the lid for an eight hours and it's kind of gelled like jello

639
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,500
This aspect pot parsley has that ability, right? So it's very binding

640
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,280
And it's also grief growth

641
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,780
Another thing I would suggest for nutrition if this person wanted to stop

642
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,620
Eating and do a little I would recommend that

643
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,360
slow down on the intake, especially the animal a

644
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,940
nutritious meal in the glass

645
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,640
Would be yes, it's not seasonal, but you can try it is

646
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,280
Soy milk peanut butter and a banana in a blender

647
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,900
so you put the soy milk in the blender then put the peanut butter first and

648
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,520
Then the banana last and always by the way when you peel a banana

649
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,520
Always peel it from the blossom end first. It tastes different

650
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,200
It's amazing how it works, you know

651
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,060
You have the blossom end which is the bottom of the banana and then the stem end where all the bananas are tied together at

652
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,120
The top naturally, right?

653
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,260
Most people break off the stem and start peeling from the stem. No, no, no

654
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:44,200
Always peel it from the blossom end where the flower is on the bottom first and a sure you could do a double blind test

655
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,240
500 people and they'll all say the banana tastes better when you peel it from the blossom end first

656
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:57,580
Just to show you. Yeah. Now. This is not seasonal, but it can be a replacement for a short time if the person is hardy

657
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,880
It's very important. See when people are not hardy

658
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,840
They can't take the cold or the heat not eating seasonally is devastating

659
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,960
If someone is not hardy and they're frail or like a sensitive person they eat seasonally

660
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,540
They're in balance right but if someone is hardy

661
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:19,980
I've met some hardy people where it'd be, you know, really cold outside and they're out in the t-shirt doesn't bother them too much, right?

662
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,080
Or whatever, you know so you can do non-seasonal

663
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,960
Why did I suggest this because the peanuts are underground?

664
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,280
The soybeans are about waist high and the bananas are much higher and they're all very lean

665
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:40,680
At the same time. Okay, right to balance out the young that's happening as a nutrition

666
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,120
Right now I've been experimenting with soy milk since the 80s. I'm not a soy boy

667
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:52,380
Remember, there's so many varieties of soys and for the American market. They've been pushing animal grade soybeans

668
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,180
That's why when you look at the silk and all these soy milks are out there

669
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:03,240
They're so full of other things because they're not using quality. So I the only way a place you get quality soy milk is Asian

670
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:10,680
Traditional Asian and the best one is called West soy and it's usually organic even though it doesn't say it

671
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,640
On the label if you look at the ingredients usually it means it says organic soybeans naturally

672
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:23,700
But I've been experimenting with and believe it or not the Walmart brand great value organic soy milk is as good as the West soy

673
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,240
Believe it or not. And so is the organic Walmart peanut butter?

674
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,340
the great value

675
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, Walmart also sells organic bananas. Oh, I want to mention this also

676
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,320
If you don't eat organic bananas, you're not eating bananas

677
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,560
You're eating some decorative thing that looks like a banana and I've mentioned this to Linda my wife many years ago

678
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,380
I said get the organic. Yeah, why is it when I buy bananas?

679
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,380
They taste good and when you buy them, they don't you know

680
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,700
Why because when they always buy bananas and make sure that they're organic and she's really yeah

681
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:03,360
There's a big difference between the flavor and the organic banana and the non-organic big difference

682
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,080
Huge same with apples, you know, if you but you don't buy an organic apple looks pretty but it doesn't taste like anything, right?

683
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,680
Now, by the way organic is a scam

684
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:19,360
When when they want to certify a batch of goods organic it has to be 60% of it has to be free of chemicals

685
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,900
And then it's a legally organic

686
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,120
That's the legal aspect right

687
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,640
Now you're a passing grade in school. They're 60% but yeah

688
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:37,040
Yeah, yeah exactly it doesn't mean that it was not it's not even how it's growing right let's sometimes the manufacturer put a label

689
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,680
It's organically growing blah blah blah, but the the legal American organic is it has to be 60% free of chemicals or whatever?

690
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,780
Yeah, right. Okay. So yeah. Yeah, so but anyway

691
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:55,400
Walmart, I did my research which is available to most people. They have organic bananas. They're only about three or four or five cents more

692
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,440
For the non-organic they have the organic peanut butter

693
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:04,280
Which is cheaper than skippy right and they have the organic great value soy milk you get the vanilla or the regular

694
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,100
I've tested them. I've tested soy milks for years now

695
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,060
West soy is the best

696
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,660
Yale's is very high quality. Also. Yale's why e o

697
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,640
apostrophe s

698
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,880
Which is named after the first?

699
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,680
acknowledged Chinese Emperor

700
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,240
is

701
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,360
It the soy milk is so rich and it's such a variety of soybean that it tastes like white corn sweet white corn

702
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,680
You ever have like sweet white corn how delicious just raw just bite into it, right?

703
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,300
That's what it tastes like when you drink that it's it's very yeah, it's pretty neat

704
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,140
But you can't find that here other than the can

705
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,080
So what what I would suggest is get the Walmart

706
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,520
Organic peanut butter organic bananas and the organic soy milk. It's in a half gallon thing. It's real cheap, too

707
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:48,860
Something

708
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,620
if you can't find the West soy either one because in other words

709
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:58,440
West soy is so good that if you want to get someone who drinks a lot of coffee off the dairy or children that are

710
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,540
into dairy in their cereal

711
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,520
Substitute it with West soy or the great value organic soy milk and they won't know it's like 2% milk

712
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,840
Okay, you know it doesn't look you know, like a lot of these milk substance. They taste terrible

713
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,380
Yeah, right

714
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,580
but if you have a child that is used to 2% or not whole milk or even whole milk and you use the

715
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,160
West so I were this great value organic

716
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,320
They won't tell the difference

717
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,580
So anyone who wants but listen if you drink too much so much you will have the same

718
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:31,720
Manifestations if you have too much dairy except you'll be a little smarter because too much dairy makes you dumb

719
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,040
Okay, or and and depressed by the way, you know

720
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,500
Do you ever notice how the they did the big dairy campaign got milk?

721
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,280
Yeah, and then at the same time there was the big depression campaign. Are you depressed?

722
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,560
Right because it causes depression in humans

723
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,860
It's amazing how when you you make the correlation and you see how it's actually manifesting

724
00:54:53,740 --> 00:55:01,260
So anyway, we kind of went into a few things of jumping around a banana grove here. And yes, no, I

725
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:08,700
Not gonna say eat cockroaches. I gave that as an example, and I'm not gonna say it winter in the US have

726
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Bananas, but winter bananas are harvested in the winter by the way

727
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,540
Right, just like oranges are harvested in the winter where they grow where they grow, right?

728
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,660
So I'm in Tucson and we have a lot of citrus here. Well, guess what? It's not till January

729
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:30,540
Well, so it's winter. It's cold here. But if the citrus is in balance, but if you take it up to New York

730
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:36,520
Oh, you're gonna lose vacuum. How do we know you lose the body's losing vacuum what develops in the body?

731
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,920
mucus

732
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:38,840
Yeah

733
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,220
Body when the body is losing vacuum where it wants to create a plug because it's losing vacuum

734
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,780
Just like you plug a tire when it's losing pressure

735
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,400
It develops mucus by the way for those that are new or maybe not

736
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,480
So I want you to go look up anatomy of a woman who is pregnant

737
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,280
What keeps the baby and all the other stuff from falling out? Oh, yeah in the cervix. It's what's it called

738
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,640
Is it anatomical point to it? It's called what the mucus mucus plug? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

739
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,020
Perfect and all these things are all these signs and code. We're here to read the codes, right? Yeah

740
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,320
Definitely
