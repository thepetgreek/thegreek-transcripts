1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
She plum so all right. I'll just lead ahead. I'll just just sit back. Yeah. Well, it won't be a long one

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,720
I might read a little bit from a thing that Michio Kushi wrote in the 1950s

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:12,840
so

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,620
Okay, fair enough. This is really it's really important be able to diagnose and analyze so

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,700
Okay. Yeah, excellent. All right. I'll get us rolling

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,560
The

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,000
Sonic event 73 and here we are now. We might have seen a few things in the chat room, but not much new

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,440
I know you got a couple of contacts here and there and you might want to address those to start with Greek

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,860
But sure also go into I don't know the further study of how things really work to after all

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,040
It's interesting to break it down and explain the process of just about anything. So where should we begin?

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,330
Well, we mentioned in the past we spoke about intuition thought action and

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,220
That would suggest

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,580
Is there a method, you know, I mean, how would you say it?

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
When you standardize stuff, you know

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Like you can have someone who builds things right like sheds and houses and all that, right? They don't need blueprints, right?

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,980
but

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,680
Our blueprints bad. No, not at all. All right, they're actually necessary. So there's a there's a

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,480
When you study a blueprint, there's a test. It's almost another language

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,560
It's not difficult to learn but it's fairly a standardized process

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,100
so I've been bringing up the yin and the yang a lot lately because I can't find anything else that

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:48,720
Shows how one can determine and make accurate predictions other than those who are good at doing that. Should I say naturally?

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Right. So it's basically teaching a method in a way

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,540
Yeah, if you understand the process how something happens in the first place, right?

24
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,200
Then it gives you the ability to understand how something might happen in the next place, right or well

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,020
It it's well, here's the thing ready. It's it's how things are always happening

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,820
Happened and are going to happen. There you go even better

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
It's really the structure

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,760
There's a there's there's not much on me to kushama. There's a bunch of books

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,540
I used to have them and they're kind of an okay read but you don't leave with much

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
His stuff isn't very good

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,480
There's a couple of books out there maybe four or five books on macrobiotics that there's one the writings of Michio Kushi

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,120
I think how old are those books? I just balanced this back out by the way, I think 60s 70s 80s

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,040
Okay, 60 70s 80s. So that's relatively new information that you're saying is useful. That's kind of

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,080
well, he's gathered and stuff from

35
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,500
from

36
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,640
Taoist thinking basically Buddhist Taoist actually all of the real ancient

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,700
Quote-unquote religions before they became staunch control mechanisms 500 years ago

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,440
Were a matter of you, you know, you go to the temple. That was your university. That was your court building, right?

39
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,260
it was your

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,440
hospital

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,940
Sort of like a little house on the prairie, right? The church was the school. It was also the meeting place

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,240
It was also the yeah, but also in a big urban environment

43
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,420
It's just it's just bifurcated into well trifurcated whatever into many different other things

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,320
so well because the control mechanism has to

45
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,160
Do what do you call it when you separate people right and you make them focus on one thing, right?

46
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,540
So compartmental you know, she's right and I was in the compartmental eyes. Yeah, so

47
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,780
Excuse me. What I would suggest is

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,700
I've had some messages about people listening and re-listening to what I gave yesterday

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,920
and it basically was a follow-through if this then that and if that then this and then

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,240
That than this and it just keeps folding over, you know

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,100
Kind of like a young child and tell him something and he's and he goes why?

52
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,580
Can you tell him why and it is but why but why right so it keeps on going, right?

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah, you could always ask why so this is the answer to the why anyway

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,220
You can always ask why and you can always ask what's next because after well then what's after and what's after sure?

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,480
That's another endless questions, isn't it?

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, but it's about

57
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,920
Tendencies, right? We talk about tendencies all the time, right?

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,200
like when you look at a cat you might expect different reaction than if you look at a dog, you know, if you're antagonized the

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,620
animal and

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,440
Because of its properties, right?

61
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,940
How they react to a loud noise for instance, right like, you know

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,540
Oh, or if you're if they get aggressive while you're holding them, right? Okay, the cats got sharp claws and all and if you understand

63
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,060
Yin and yang you could predict that without even ever

64
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,700
Like you'd see a cat and say, oh that probably that animal probably has sharp claws

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,120
And if you look at a dog, you'll say it probably doesn't right

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
if you understand the concepts of

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
Let's just say yin and yang which I don't want to keep

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,840
Leaning on too much that if anyone I brought this up has any other solutions on how to describe it expensive contractive or what?

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Have you?

70
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,880
Let's use it

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,340
But because when you keep saying yin and yang it sounds like you've just done some kind of modified Asian philosophy, right?

72
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,840
Yes

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,360
You know, most people have heard of it

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,100
Very few people know how to use it what very few people most people still know a little bit about it

75
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,980
But very few people know how to use it and it is the basis of how things work here. Oh, there's um

76
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,000
they don't like using the colors either because people used to say well, there's a matter of black and white right and

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,680
Black and white or two modes as opposed to being colors and they're very

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,740
Opposite in their way, right one reflects everything one sucks everything in and they seem to be these opposing and balancing forces

79
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,300
One way or another that could equally appear in almost anything light

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,420
They're not no, they're not balancing here. This is the other thing. This is a little Greek speak mixed in

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,320
You know, let's say you have a scales and they're bouncing up and down right, you know, if the old-fashioned scales left and right

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,900
Oh, yeah scale with a fulcrum in the middle. What happens when they're balanced?

83
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,920
There's no more movement

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Right, so that means stagnation. So what happens is when you you never truly achieve balance

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,140
It's slightly lean one way slightly more than the other to maintain movement

86
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,180
Because quote-unquote use this term loosely the construct the universe

87
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,340
The relationship that we have with our perception to what we consider real, right?

88
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,860
Always has some kind of motion or change, you know, like the half-life of elements, right?

89
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,600
For example, which takes a long time. Okay, listen, I'll go over this

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,900
This is a I'm reading off of a PDF if you just search Michio Kushi in folios

91
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,540
I n f o l i o s in folios. It's not a Rex research.com site

92
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,920
Rex research has a lot of stuff on inventions and all that other stuff speaking of inventions before I get started

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,500
I got an email about some

94
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,670
question about cars and it's from down under and

95
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,050
My response was I'll get into it a little bit

96
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,490
But I just wanted my response was

97
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,570
Spark plugs and throttle body if you can rework the throttle body and the spark plugs you're on your way

98
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,430
That's the two things that have been ignored in the automotive industry and I have two techniques

99
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,370
The spark plug technique and the throttle body technique are both modified techniques

100
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,010
But I've optimized them so and I gave the initial

101
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,610
Basically, you just drill a hole on the J strap, you know a strap at the end of the

102
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,550
Spark plug so the when the combustion or the spark occurs

103
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,390
The hole looks it's an aperture acts like a port in the rest of the bore

104
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,970
The piston sees the spark instead of being completely blocked. And the other one is there's something called the gadget man groove

105
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,530
What was his name

106
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,450
Ron Hatton

107
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,450
Kind of took his own life after a car accident, but a couple of years ago

108
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,490
He's one of these guys that says we need to do this to make the world a better place

109
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,530
And I always told him don't say that I've had personal calls with him for since 2013

110
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,270
And actually performed that

111
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,190
Service but on my own it's modified

112
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,510
There's plenty of videos on it

113
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,250
And you can do it yourself if you study it, but you know, it's kind of like if you get a recipe

114
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,090
You know you modify it, right? Usually if you're into cooking, right?

115
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,390
so these things

116
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,549
Have been around but they're not popular. But those two things will give you a lot more power and a lot better efficiency

117
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,490
I just wanted to bring that up. There's a well used to be known actually right now

118
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,130
So there's a sub or two that I work with their cars and they're always amazed by the results

119
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,990
on what I do with the throttle body and the

120
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,870
Spark plugs. So I just wanted to bring that up and the water device

121
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,050
I just mentioned if you've been around and gotten Sonics, I've brought up pretty much the crux of the matter

122
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,250
I am working an industry right now and part of it is they want to keep some of the developments because it's constantly being developed

123
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,770
A little hush and I said well for how long well just for a little while

124
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,250
so we'll see, you know how that goes, but essentially what was been put out on the

125
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,690
Let's say five six months ago

126
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,630
On Sonics and in the chat regarding the water device is pretty much the the crux of the matter if you do that

127
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,150
You got you got it, right?

128
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,050
So yeah, so anyway, I want to get into

129
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,130
Because the last Sonic was about addressing

130
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:45,410
Several things even to the point of carbonizing cockroaches, right? Right. I think people got that and they and the logic behind that, right?

131
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,430
Yeah, so I want to spring up some points because

132
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,450
Macrobiotics again when you say that it sounds medical it sounds

133
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,350
Macrobiotics isn't so just macro means big and biotics means life, right?

134
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,610
So it yeah again and if you look at macrobiotics, it's what is it if you study it

135
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,050
It's and you end up doing a modified Japanese diet or a Japanese diet pretty much and modified

136
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,850
You know, which is leaning on whole grains and legumes and vegetables, let's say and

137
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,970
You you really it turns off a lot of people when you get into condiments

138
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,670
Which I did get into how condiments affect you also on the last one

139
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,190
It's the first thing that comes out

140
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,750
Because it was the last thing that went in right? So in a way in terms of the way the body sees it

141
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,350
What I would say is

142
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,630
When you get into microbiotics and you look at the condiments they use they're strictly Japanese condiments and you're like, oh man

143
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,010
This is kind of a turn-off to someone who is like

144
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,210
Would say Western or just Western, right? So

145
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,430
yeah, modifying these things because you'll notice eventually that it's about

146
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,330
Original Greek speak where I went into regarding in food intake and living

147
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:12,790
Across latitude living and eating right wherever you are in the earth. You have temp we have northern and southern polar zones cold

148
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,470
You've got temperate

149
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:22,930
Zones both northern southern hemisphere and you have the equatorial and those three areas that I just mentioned are very different

150
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,330
And whether what things grow, right?

151
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,630
traditional

152
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,990
Ways of living and if you just follow that right it just to recap

153
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,800
if you're in New York City, and it's cold outside and you drink orange juice any tropical fruit and

154
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,520
Sugars where sugar comes from right tropical

155
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,900
your body is going to be adjusted to a

156
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,280
That climate even though you're living in the in the winter a lot different latitude

157
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,760
You will lose biological vacuum and to compensate for that. The body produces mucus. That's all it is now, by the way

158
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,500
from the

159
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:07,280
Laboratory clinical perspective they will say it's bacteria. Yeah, there is bacteria and quote-unquote things in there that the body produced

160
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,460
It's not like you contained

161
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
Contagious

162
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,760
Contracted bacteria that made you sick. It's backwards. You see so your body your body becomes a petri dish, which is possible, right?

163
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,740
It's not the intake of the bacteria. It's the growing of the bacteria internally

164
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,700
from the loss of vacuum

165
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,020
Increase of mucus. Yeah mucus whenever there's mucus, by the way

166
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,500
That is your first sign that you're losing biological vacuum

167
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,300
And this by the way is not in any of the macrobiotic writings at all

168
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,360
This is not addressed and one thing that's a turn-off for me personally about Michio Kushi big-time is his belief in

169
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,060
The viral theory and AIDS is a real disease. He didn't know how can someone so quote-unquote smart and wise

170
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,120
Fall for that, right? I think we've gone over that several times. There is no AIDS disease

171
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,820
It's it's a cycle. It's a psyop a very dangerous psyop right and just to recap

172
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,740
They have a bullshit test recently there was a lab

173
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,000
There's an article that got 1,500 samples by the way COVID samples that were positive and they reviewed them like an audit

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,640
There was not none of the 1,500 positive samples had any virus of any kind in it or you know what they're saying, right?

175
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,840
And he says they didn't even they didn't bother using the bullshit PCR test actually wrote bullshit in the lab report, right?

176
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,320
That's how bad it is

177
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,020
So it's a test for nothing really I will do it basically test how much puss is in the blood so

178
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,000
Quickly, how do you spell?

179
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Kushi's name by the way, I just say

180
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,640
Okay with a K and the rest of how it sounds you s hi. Okay. Okay, Michio. Yeah

181
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,920
Okay, no problem, which is a very common name like Bill or Bob or John in Japan. Yeah

182
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,800
No, I know it but I just wanted to check the last name. That's all. Thank you

183
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,140
Yeah, fine

184
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,280
The family name in Japan they do it backwards by the way, your family name comes first, so when you

185
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,500
Say Jing ping in China. Also, there's it's ping ZG. It's right. They do the last name first

186
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,800
There's you know, so it's like Kim Jong-un Kim Jong soon. The reason is because Kim is the family name

187
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,040
Yeah, yeah, exactly. But yeah, right. It's not like yeah, right, right

188
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,680
Wait Westerners kind of do that when they when it's abbreviated, but you know, even in a non abbreviated they do it backwards last name first

189
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,320
In Asia, so yeah, cool

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,580
So he fell for that but but just to recap on the AIDS they they have this test that basically is

191
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,620
Statistically impossible and impossible and they just send out letters that let's prank this guy or that could be dumped and pulling out of a hat

192
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,660
And that's positive and then they follow up because they have your contact information, right?

193
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,460
on oh

194
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,340
You know, you were possibly tested maybe positive for a very serious illness, right?

195
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,820
That could be a service never that it is a serial

196
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,720
So you should consider treatment possibly and they keep sending and then people are gullible

197
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,900
They don't say that you have it. They say you've been in contact with it, right?

198
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,060
No, you've been you've been maybe tested positive for a potentially positive

199
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,080
For potentially a hazardous disease or dangerous disease potentially

200
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,820
I thought it was they they say you tested positive for exposure to

201
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,080
Dangerous they could they could use all kinds of language because they have to consult the creative writing department at the medical department

202
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, and they say you're writing the person goes for treatment and we know what happens

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,000
They look like crap and they feel like crap and they die and they say well, we have records that they had AIDS

204
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,080
Oh, yeah, everybody's like, oh my gosh AIDS is killing so many people. It's people are really

205
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,740
Right stupid when it comes to this stuff because they're stuck. Here's the thing

206
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,400
What does that basically say is that if people really tightened up their psychology?

207
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,960
Let's say their mind. They would be less gullible if they're less gullible. There'd be no AIDS

208
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,100
Right, there'd be little fewer financial troubles, right? Just ask the bank week

209
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,900
You loan I never got a loan. How can you give a loan? There's no money, you know? Yeah, well show me the loan

210
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,620
Yeah, it's kind of hard to think if people weren't stupid. They wouldn't be poor, you know

211
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,480
Yeah, right, but but yeah, all this stuff is cut if everybody's doing a cutout. This is a cutout operation

212
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,780
Right. So how much choice do they have a lot of choice, but I don't know

213
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,880
I don't know about that lately. I've been speaking to people

214
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,380
Inventors and you and they're not smart at all. I mean, oh my gosh. How did this person get there?

215
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,740
It's like well my gosh talk about like

216
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,820
Floating through life, you know

217
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,180
It's very easy. By the way, you can go, you know, what depends on the University

218
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,120
You can go to university and get a degree pretty much anything and just graduate with low marks

219
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,800
They'll still give you the degree right and then you have social rank, right?

220
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,220
Jeez it's pretty

221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,340
It was pretty spooky pretty spooky

222
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,640
House, how ridiculous I'm not about professional people, you know, oh my gosh scary. Anyway doctor really from this. Yeah

223
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,420
Oh my gosh, you know, there are no there are no doctors anymore there. There haven't been

224
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,840
long time

225
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,700
You know, by the way, I've never gotten a shot. I think I'm gonna bring this story up to show you how everything's cut out

226
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:08,980
In

227
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,900
1970 or so in order to go to school

228
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,020
Had to have they had these green or blue cards was a kind of cardboard index card

229
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,200
Yeah, it was a vaccine card. He wrote down what vaccines you got, right? That's right. And

230
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,720
I was at a doctor's office, which was in the front of his house back then

231
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,440
The doctors operate a lot of them operated, you know out of their homes. The living room was converted into

232
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,700
They put up partitions and a little waiting area in the living room right and side rooms built in receptionist, right?

233
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah, and they some gaze examination rooms

234
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,800
They called them examination right in some cases the front of the house was the doctor's office and then just passed a certain point

235
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,380
Where the bathroom is usually boom past that bathroom is the living space. Yeah. Mm-hmm

236
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,300
They did that in Jersey to you

237
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,240
so I remember I was a tall guy bald head big head bald and

238
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,500
It was snowing outside I was there with the siblings or waiting quite a while with the moms and

239
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,040
Hand but with the cards to get stamped after you get the shot

240
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,540
The receptionist his wife goes in there. She kind of

241
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,080
Yells and tells everybody be calm because he died. He fell over and had a heart attack and passed out

242
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,460
I don't I think he died

243
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,080
Yeah, so I looked through the door being curious child. You see this really tall man in a white robe with

244
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,520
Gray pants flannel pants and very polished shoes laying down sight with his head sideways in his mouth open

245
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,600
first time I saw someone you know, but that and

246
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,760
She went around to the people who were waiting and it was a snowy day

247
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,900
So it was just us in another group another lady and maybe man. So what are you here for?

248
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,180
and she said here go here, you know and

249
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,120
They came to us and they said what are you here for?

250
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,760
Showed the cards and she just takes the cards and stamps and stamps and stamps them by you got it

251
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,660
There you go. Never got the right never got any of those polio's measles, whatever. They were jacking people up with

252
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,780
Right. So now think about that. What are the chances of that, right?

253
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,340
Well, there you go. Those are the chances

254
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,080
Back then so, you know something unusual

255
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,920
Right because typically they would say go somewhere else and get the shot she but she felt that it was

256
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,080
Okay to just right. In other words, let's look at it this way. She knew it's bullshit

257
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,120
You don't need the shots, right? You just need the stamp on the card, right?

258
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,140
Apparently because otherwise she would have said oh no what I'm gonna do is send you somewhere else

259
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,460
Somebody else can give it to you or maybe she could have given it to you. She was a good enough nurse, right?

260
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,540
Oh, look, I'll do it because yeah

261
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,280
If it was what they said it was she would make sure that we got him just like she sent the other people to another

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,040
Office, but even then it was known. It was bullshit couldn't have been that big of a deal

263
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,100
Yeah 19th and that's funny because that's like a 70 we're talking

264
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,680
6970

265
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,740
Black and white TV in the living room and there was moon landing and there was some people there and they were saying this is a

266
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,160
fraud

267
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,020
Hmm

268
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,000
Adults and the family friends

269
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,620
Okay, while it was going on. I remember it was late at night when it was happening was 10 ish 11 ish

270
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,140
Eastern time live or whatever. This is this is a total fraud and I looked at him and I looked at TSA

271
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,780
Yeah, it looks kind of fake

272
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,980
I gotta say that's the first time I've ever heard somebody say right away on that day when it was being because that was a big

273
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,680
Deal watching that live on the black and white. Yeah

274
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,160
Someone is standing right where they were sitting and standing and they're like, this is a fraud

275
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,380
That's the first time a lot in real time. Yeah. Yeah, that's the first time I've heard of a group of people doing that in

276
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,160
Real time. Yeah, that's a very awake group of people. It is the early early truthers. I was around

277
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,200
I wonder if you that that has a great deal of influence over who it is. You have to yeah, it has to think about it

278
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, just a little mental aside my apologies. No, no, that's true

279
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,440
Figure I'd share that because I think both not getting the shot of being around people like that, you know, which we're not relatives

280
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,920
They were just friends. It doesn't matter. You know how they say

281
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,420
It's a village. It's not the families are supposed to just provide food clothing and shelter

282
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,920
the rest of it's supposed to be the acquaintances and associates of the family the education and all that right psychologically and

283
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,460
Culturally and all that. It's absolutely true. You can't do it with just the two parents and

284
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,240
siblings, that's impossible

285
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,560
You need more than that to add to create a culture you don't have a culture out of two people, right?

286
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,480
yeah, and one of the things I was always very suspect with chicken because similar people like that would

287
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,220
Be a ghast if you were serving chicken because they come back from Vietnam

288
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,380
So when they would go into a village, it would be all the chickens that were left alive. We're eating the humans, right?

289
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,480
people are not aware of how

290
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,580
Natural tendencies that say they eat each other to by the way if a chicken dies in the pen

291
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,640
They'll come, you know

292
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,300
Remove it. It'll be eaten by the other chickens. Oh, yeah, absolutely. If you don't they'll go they'll eat it

293
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,160
Yeah, which is I could see what's going on there

294
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,740
But anyway, that was yeah

295
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,400
So another lots of little things that came across as a young person because you imagine being that young and someone's oh no

296
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,740
Chicken, that's disgusting. It kind of gets stuck. You know, even if you ask why you know, you guys right?

297
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,960
You see the chicken McNuggets growing up in a totally different way, right?

298
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,840
So they can see a lot of things in a different way if you're accustomed to seeing something in you know

299
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,140
Well, you've been influenced just by someone saying in an adult, right? That's that's how we've brought up before

300
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,920
Often people say well, I'm not technical. I'm not good at that

301
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,820
I said, you know, I could see where that comes from because we all have the same capability

302
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:53,100
Because as they were young they heard someone influential or it was accepted to say so and they said oh I could say

303
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,900
I'm not good at math and not have to do the work to learn it and I'll be fine

304
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,880
Just like they were I'll do that

305
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,460
right

306
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,640
You see and they copy and emulate

307
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,680
How many times you've been in public and seen see young children speak like the Marvel stuff or the cartoons that you see on TV?

308
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,960
They write they emulate that in their speech

309
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:20,440
Emulation exactly. So whether it's choosing to eat or not eat a food or it's choosing to use certain words or certain phrases or whatever

310
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,040
It's all based on this external input that you're yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I say get him while they're young, right?

311
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,340
Get him while they're young

312
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,560
Whatever in terms of influence. Okay, so the way to read off of this because this is a very comprehensive

313
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,620
it's about a dozen or so things and I'll throw my my

314
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:46,860
Three cents into it. So he's got a on the left column stuff like tendency position structure direction color temperature weight catalyst atomic

315
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,060
Elements construction of vibration and then he has a column in the middle for you

316
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,310
column on the right is young and I'll just go through each one and it's it'll be very basic and

317
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,120
maybe I'll throw something else and so in terms of

318
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,120
Tendency, I'm gonna go through these first and and then I'll read some principles here and some unified theorem

319
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,760
Okay, so for a tendency yin is expansion. Yang is contraction

320
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,260
For position yin is outward yang is inward

321
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,380
Okay in terms of structure

322
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,320
he says yin is space and time is young which I disagree because there's time is just a

323
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,460
Measurement. So time is distance by the way with no distance. There's no time, right? Well something changes. There's a distance, right?

324
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,800
Yeah, but you don't object to the expansion and contraction. I know no, but I think that one should be left out

325
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,080
Okay, I just I'm putting that shit. Yeah, I'm not gonna leave anything

326
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,980
Listen, I'll tell you how to look at it in a way that you can consider

327
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,820
You could say that time is young and believe that there is such a thing as time. I'm telling you there isn't

328
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,420
It's merely the measurement of distance, right?

329
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,860
So because even measuring distance takes time. Haha. No pun intended

330
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,160
Yeah, so yeah, and then direction. I'll actually direction up is

331
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Yin, and just you know ascent is yin and descent is young down. It's young color

332
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,900
Purple is yin red is young

333
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,480
Temperature cold is yin

334
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,420
Hot is young

335
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,480
And just to go on that when you have a lot of cold it makes things hard like water and other things, right?

336
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,800
Which are young?

337
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:31,300
Okay, so if cold is yin if you affect something like water with a lot of cold or a banana or whatever

338
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,100
With a lot of cold what happens it gets harder and harder, but wait a second. I thought cold was yin

339
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah, it makes things the opposite

340
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,540
The antagonistic heart, right?

341
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,560
Okay, give an example on that because it's very explain you ever see where they have liquid nitrogen, which is minus 100 and whatever below

342
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Okay, they dip they have a nail on a board and they dip a hammer in

343
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,440
It and they try to drive the nail and the nail the hammer shatters like glass

344
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,780
Of course, then they dip they dip a banana, but you can drive the nail with a banana

345
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,900
Why and it doesn't shatter

346
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,000
Why because the the hammer is already very young and you tip it over comes too young and it can't hold its young anymore

347
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,620
But the banana started off being yin and you made it really young and it's gonna hold its it can hold that

348
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,660
You see that didn't shatter

349
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay in terms of weight lightweight is yin and heavyweight is young

350
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,140
in terms of catalysts

351
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,360
Water is yin and fire is yang in an atomic

352
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,900
Structure yin would be an electron a proton would be young

353
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,380
He's got elements. Yeah, that's a strange thing about fire and water though

354
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,160
because it almost I

355
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,100
Don't know why but my impression is that fire would be more of a transient thing

356
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,380
Water is more of a solid thing

357
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,660
Well, hold on water is an exception because if you start compressing water

358
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,380
You think it would become more yin like compressing a banana, right which is young

359
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,220
But it actually becomes more young than what you're compressing it with

360
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:09,040
So what this one thing meets your cushy did not appreciate water. You could not get into the talking about it

361
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,980
Hmm, which is by the way water is a lifelong pursuit

362
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:20,520
No, just studying water. Absolutely. I'm just thinking in a pure physical sense though that one is more substantive than the other

363
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,820
Now fire by the way fire is oxidation. Yeah

364
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,660
But that fires oxidation, but you can't have fire without oxygen and that's a different type of fire strange fire

365
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,560
If you want to go that way

366
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, but see there you go

367
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,940
Is that you know fire requires other things to feed it and it also in and of itself is not really an object

368
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,300
It's more of an action water is

369
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,520
objectively

370
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,200
Something well, so the category was under catalyst

371
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:55,340
You know, let's go under catalyst. Okay, that's why I'll skip the elements because he's got elements of various things like potassium oxygen

372
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,780
Calcium or yin and yang would be hydrogen arsenic chlorine sodium in terms of construction

373
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,460
The surface of something is yin, but the inside is the young part

374
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,480
Vibration shortwave is yin and yang is longwave just like the colors. Let's say in terms of expression work

375
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,960
Psychological work is yin physical work is young

376
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,540
In terms of attitude gentle or negative is yin active and positive is

377
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,840
Young or forceful, right and biology vegetables are typically yin and animals are typically young

378
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,020
But I've gotten into and I'll read some of the principles anything nutritive is yin

379
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,680
Because right because young is the protection element

380
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,460
Usually and that's more advanced

381
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,240
But I don't mind throwing the advanced part in first because when you throw the advanced in part first what you're going to learn anyway

382
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,660
It set tends to be more self-corrected the system, right?

383
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,120
If you have more advanced knowledge on something you're less likely to make a mistake as a beginner, by the way

384
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,860
That's a philosophy. Maybe I find that to be true in many cases, right?

385
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,480
so

386
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,360
Okay in terms of gender or sex yin is

387
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,160
Female male is young

388
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,380
That which that should be a major example, right? That's pretty simple there, right?

389
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,200
And then in terms of nerve we have ortho sympathetic or parasympathetic. Oh, what the hell is that?

390
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,460
Okay, so ortho sympathetic is yin ortho sympathetic is where you get a nerve impulse and parasympathetic is young

391
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,780
That's where the body

392
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,230
Relaxes right actually it's in reverse there but in terms of

393
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,760
This is kind of then he has the cold season is yin

394
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,180
Hot season is yang

395
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,000
Right, but what's interesting in the cold season things that are affected by the cold season become hard

396
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,280
right and yang and

397
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,980
And the heat season for the hot season things become yin when you look I love melting right so hot, right?

398
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,260
What's melting? Is that yin or yang? It's yin. See that's a good

399
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,360
Way to see the antagonism, it's calls a polarity

400
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,540
I don't believe in polarity and opposites attract and things there's no attraction there get into that

401
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,940
Then basically tastes hot sour sweet is yin

402
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,960
Salty and bitter is yang

403
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,300
Tropical climate would be yin a cold climate is yang and summer is yin winter is yang

404
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,740
We'll stop right there because then he gets into other things that are more technical or chemical

405
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,620
so here's a

406
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,380
Seven principles of the order of the universe. This is Michio Kushi

407
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,560
Influenced by George Osawa also

408
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,360
I mean sounds like an Asian filed modified Asian philosophy here very much and the thing is this needs to be redone

409
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,960
More on the western side, you know

410
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
well, I

411
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,960
Shouldn't say needs to be redone. But the whole thing has died away, you know, you don't hear about it anymore, you know very much

412
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,020
so

413
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,380
I'm gonna take this with a grain of salt

414
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,240
So number one, he has seven principles of the order of the universe. All things are differentiated an apparatus of one infinity

415
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,720
Everything changes is number two. Number three all antagonisms are complementary

416
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,480
Tell that to your wife the next time she wants to

417
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,360
You want to have an argument? Actually, they want to set the argument anyway

418
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,580
For there's nothing nothing is identical

419
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,020
Five what has a front has a back six the bigger the front the bigger the back

420
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,440
Seven what has a beginning has an end?

421
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,080
Now the bigger the front the bigger the back was a classic if you hang around macro neurotics, I mean macrobiotics

422
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,200
When you give something good what it does it's a very leveling mood leveling or thought leveling

423
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,700
Way to think

424
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,140
The bigger the front the bigger the backs when someone's got really good news or or you know, really good

425
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,940
Let's say proposal even what what's the catch? What's the backside right? Right and that always goes together

426
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:14,400
So people that are in the macro biotic stuff when you give them something really good. Well, what's the backs? What's the counter?

427
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,420
You know, what's what what's the backside right?

428
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:23,680
So so that can actually drive people to seem pessimistic or not really grasp the opportunity

429
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,480
I should say take advantage of an opportunity

430
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,240
So anyway

431
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,840
Well to adjust that with attitude. It's what you know, the greater the risk or the greater the

432
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,180
Investment the greater the return right the great

433
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,480
Not always a lot of people have made great risks and lost everything and end up sleeping on a park bench

434
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,580
No, but the only way to achieve the great return is to take the great risk, you know that not not

435
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah, that's a saying not true either. I'm not saying it's true. I'm just applying it

436
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,120
Yeah in a world when you figure out it's cut out

437
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,300
Most of these people I've been around people very wealthy and said tell me how you got there or forget. Well, I'd be go read

438
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,000
How these wealthy people you could access online or whatever pick one and look at their bio and their history doesn't add up

439
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Doesn't make sense never does

440
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,280
Right. It's a cut out. Yeah

441
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,740
right, so

442
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,960
to go on a certain theorems here

443
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,180
Infinity differentiates itself into yin and yang which are the poles that become into operation when the infinite

444
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,060
centrifugal

445
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Arrives to the geometric point of bifurcation

446
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,620
Okay, so basically you just described the shape of the galaxy right when you see the swirling pattern in a galaxy

447
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,020
Yin and yang continuously form from infant centrifugal this

448
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,500
centrifugality

449
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,980
so

450
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,300
basically

451
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,520
Both yin and yang come from the expansion of the universe. So this is Big Bang Theory, which I'm not into either

452
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,420
Yin is centrifugal yang is centripetal

453
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,660
Yin, and yang together produce energy and all phenomena both material and energetically

454
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,860
Yin attracts yang and yang attracts yin

455
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,800
You don't agree because you'll see why here in a moment

456
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,020
Yin repels yin yang repels yang

457
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,600
The force of attraction and repulsion is proportional to the difference of yin and yang

458
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,159
Components yin and yang combined in varying proportions produce energy and all phenomena again

459
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,760
phenomena, by the way, if

460
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:30,480
Is material also because you know as they the quacky scientists tell you which is correct and to some degree when they look at an atom

461
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,360
Let's say a very dense material

462
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,000
It's atomic structure. Well, you know the best they can measure the closer they look there's nothing there

463
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,080
But once they get down to the electron proton

464
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,639
Right

465
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,900
Level the the distance between the electron and the proton that makes supposedly the solid atom is so great

466
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,860
That you could say the atom is 98% empty space if not more, right?

467
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,500
So that makes material a phenomenon

468
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,640
Because how does it feel so solid when there's nothing there versus nom noumenon?

469
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,620
The majority of anything that you encounter as a solid object is actually composed of empty space. Yeah

470
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,140
So so that means that anything material is actually a phenomenon once you start viewing it as such then you can get into the

471
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,700
transmutation aspect of things

472
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,620
And by the way from a spiritual point of view, the highest level of transmutation is to transmute yourself, by the way, right?

473
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,740
so into a higher being

474
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,320
Well, that's the catch

475
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,380
okay, nothing is yin solely or nothing is solely young and

476
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,660
There's nothing neuter. It's either yin or yang in

477
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,770
Excess in every occurrence says here large yin. Here we go

478
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,460
Large yin attracts small yin and large yang attracts small yang

479
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,080
This is this is the idea of the ether that the potential goes from low to high. It's not attraction

480
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,400
It's that the lower potential the small yin will go to the larger

481
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,320
Right. This is yeah

482
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,460
So all extremes, okay yin produces yang in extreme situations and yang produces yin

483
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,480
Give an example like you have a grenade in your hand

484
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,180
Military, you know, I'm the grenade grenade and it's young it's small. It's very dense

485
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,760
It's hard right focused, right? Right when you pull the pin what happens immediate expansion, which is yin and

486
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,440
pulling the pin is so extreme that the

487
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,180
grenade ceases to be

488
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,840
That would be an extreme action when something ceases to be right

489
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
So the same with the hammer, which the iron is already very young

490
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,240
but if you make it more young with the being of the cold it gets

491
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,860
So brittle which what is something brittle when it breaks yin spreads out everywhere, right?

492
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,320
Where the banana was or yin it could take the the yang reaction from the yin cold

493
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,220
So it's a flipping process

494
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,440
You're subjected to something that has a yin component and he's that mostly yin components and he's subjected to some young

495
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,520
Then you can predict what the reaction will be

496
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,500
Right, and then if you have something with many yin components and predict subjected to the more yin

497
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,860
You can predict what it will be but in the process

498
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:21,640
There's a relative scale though, because look if you put a hammer in a refrigerator, it's not going to shatter

499
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,240
It's not producing enough yin

500
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,820
Too much of one flips and become its opposite, right?

501
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,900
So for example when someone is going on an angry tirade and they're done with their tirade

502
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,060
Which is very forceful noisy very young

503
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,820
When they're done with their tirade what results they fall down and go to sleep

504
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:51,620
Which is Yin. Yeah, so this you can apply this to everything in anything even color theory, by the way

505
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,140
Anything and everything but again

506
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:01,900
It sounds like the Greek is some kind of Asian file, you know using some modified to Asian philosophy and if we can find a

507
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,760
Basis in Western quote-unquote philosophy or methodology. I'd be willing to adapt it a little bit more because guess what?

508
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,660
We speak a Western tongue

509
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,400
It's a Western culture usually, you know

510
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,280
And all that it'd be good to develop something like that after we develop a b c d e f and geos also

511
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,390
No, absolutely

512
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,290
the only the only thing that stands outside of this of course is the

513
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,290
I heard this once and I don't remember exactly what the context was

514
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,590
But you can't get everything from nothing and you also can't get nothing from everything

515
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,430
So yeah at the most extreme points

516
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,250
it's

517
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,670
Not, you know

518
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,910
In other words, there has to be something in order for it to become everything there has to be nothing in order for it to

519
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,130
Be nothing, you know what I mean?

520
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:50,830
so

521
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,290
There is there is an extreme point on the scale where this does fall off

522
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:01,670
But only at the most extreme point. Yeah, but here's one way to use it lately

523
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,410
I've been working lately past six nine months or something on developing things

524
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,010
Technical devices and when I get to a point I want to make an improvement or I know there's something else

525
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:16,430
That's let's say hasn't come into fruition. I use the yin and yang principle

526
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,830
And so when you're thinking about something and you're asking, you know internally out loud even and

527
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:31,410
You're thinking about it for hours and days and weeks on on on and you're not getting any any development at all

528
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,070
It gets kind of tired, right? It's like I'm not getting it. I mean, come on throw me a bone, right?

529
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,930
I'm not getting any develop nothing. I'm thinking about it. What right thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking nothing

530
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:48,530
Doesn't mean stop thinking keep it going keep thinking thinking thinking thinking and what happens you get a little tired

531
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,870
And it's like seems played out to be asking those questions still

532
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:59,310
How can we make this better right and it gets more played out and it kind of wears you out a little you get tired

533
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,490
Right, you keep doing it and you're like more almost like OCD. I guess might be the

534
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:11,670
Application here. It's like he's guy still talking about or thinking about this for weeks and he's got no headway keep doing it

535
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,090
To the point where you become so Ying

536
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,150
From it so expansive seemingly most people would give up way before

537
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,410
Nothing's coming to them right and he's still doing it what happens suddenly like a bolt of lightning BAM

538
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:32,570
What happens young the idea comes and hits you like a bolt of lightning out of nowhere very sharp very focused

539
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,530
Right write it down

540
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,750
Actually, sometimes it's so sharp and focused. You don't have to write it down

541
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,110
It's like a 3d image in your brain. You can touch it feel it smell it, right?

542
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,930
So in other words

543
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,130
persisting

544
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,150
right

545
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:55,570
It's in thought I find that to be a formula that works for me when there's no solution for something hold on to that idea

546
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,670
Even though you're not making any headway so long just keep something

547
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,210
Even in the biblical text keep knocking keep asking right and errors

548
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,410
Just keep it going and then it comes like a shot like a shot

549
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:15,610
Right so that actually works for me and ever and sometimes when I don't have an answer for something

550
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,610
I'll just persistently

551
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:24,430
Keep that question and try to look at it from sideways up down right and it does the answers always do come like a shot

552
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,460
But you have to keep expanding you can't just do right with repetition though, right? I mean exactly. Yeah

553
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,720
It's like almost imagine you're traveling in a desert for days and weeks and you just see the horizon or in the ocean

554
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,220
You're on a boat and you're just days and weeks. It's like I don't see any land

555
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,200
Just keep going and then you'll see what you'll see a very sharp focused little island young, right?

556
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:55,000
It's typically the story but to make the story work the way I'm saying that is counterproductive

557
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,520
If you walk for weeks in a giant circle

558
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,000
You're gonna accomplish nothing because you're covering the same ground over and over again

559
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,760
You will you will because you'll notice the center of the circle the young part that you're walking in a circle and you should maybe

560
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,180
stop

561
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,600
The moment you realize you're walking in a circle is when the yin and the yang come together
