1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:15,560
Sonic Event 74, you know, it's funny, I keep making that same mistake at the beginning,

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,820
now it's become the intro accidentally.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,160
And that's okay, sometimes patterns are meant to emerge a certain way, and sometimes you're

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,800
meant to break them, and I gotta tell you, it's inspiration.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,920
Anyway, maybe we'll get to that, maybe we'll get to some other things.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,020
Greek, how you doing tonight?

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm doing all right.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,880
Any messages we should look at?

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,540
Anything we got noteworthy?

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,540
I did get one, I was gonna see if you wanted to record something short, but you know, we

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,780
could just combine this all together into one, and, well, still make it short if we

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,260
want, I mean, we can go any direction you want to.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,660
The only odd thing I got in a message, which I wasn't sure if I should bring up to you,

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,180
is, you know, look, I've separated myself from participating in a whole lot of rituals

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,180
and things like this, this is the message that I got.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
And I'm still surrounded by people doing, you know, Christmas.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,560
That's fine, it's fine.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm going to talk a little bit about something like that, which we also did on episode 47.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,780
Yeah, yeah, so, but the thing is, I'm still surrounded by people doing Christmas, and

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm out of place, you know, how should I handle this?

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,140
Because I have a want to be kind of mean about it, but I don't want to be mean about it.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,060
Yeah, so, go ahead.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
Very, very simple.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,360
I've been running all week, not into the Christmas thing, because usually here, there's some

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,740
spiritual protection that you get after a while, or maybe you get it before you know,

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,980
or after or during you know what's going on.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,200
I'd be standing at the register for checkout and register, you know, the cashiers wishing

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,120
everybody a Merry Christmas after the transaction, right?

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,080
I get up there, do the transaction, have a good day, and they don't even know me.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,100
It's almost like it doesn't apply.

31
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,160
We all know intuitively what's right and wrong with every individual, let's say.

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,200
But what I wanted to bring up, well, a couple of things we before we got on, we started

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,020
talking about burdock and food and all that.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,519
Yeah.

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,140
And I don't like to say I told you so, but anybody who's done the rice number seven or

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,620
number eight, I told you so.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,100
It has nothing to do with, hey, this is how you make this dish, you know, to taste good.

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,000
It has nothing to do with taste, but it will end up tasting good.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,460
No, but you know how to do that too.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,820
Yeah, you know how to do that too.

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,820
You know how to make things to taste, but that isn't what this is particularly about, which

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,680
is funny because look, if I got a report back that, hey, this sucks, I would definitely call

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,280
you out on it.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,880
But no, everyone, you do get the energy.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,020
Excuse me.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,340
You do get the energy and the vitality and what would you say, revitalization and recuperation

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,860
properties if you keep it up.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,340
Right.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Because we're, you know, you actually end up, the humans were made to eat grain.

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,280
We were made as grain eaters.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,860
And it's funny how they, you know, oh, well, the grain is carbs.

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,260
It's not, you know, I think I've gone over this other thing as a carb or protein.

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,380
There is, but it's just one little nitrogen atom.

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,440
If you look at the molecule, it's the same thing.

55
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,100
It's a scam.

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,080
Well, some people have also taken the idea that, look, you feed the grains to animals

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,360
and we're not like other animals.

58
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,680
Well, no, but some people want to go with a whole, you know, look, I'm a special animal

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,000
route.

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,320
And I mean, physiologically, are we all that much different when you get down to it, the

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,900
mechanics when it comes to nutrition and feeding a body?

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,240
Are we actually all that much different from a lot of other animals?

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,040
Maybe not so much, right?

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,560
We are.

65
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,280
We are.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah, we don't.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,260
Well, you can go to many directions on that.

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,140
We are, but we are not an animal per se, either, because the spirit is not.

69
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,600
Remember, the animals are very different.

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,300
They come downloaded, pre downloaded software programs, operating systems.

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,860
We don't remember.

72
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,820
But is the food the same way?

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,480
See, that's the thing.

74
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,640
Is the food the same way?

75
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:56,900
Yes.

76
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,560
All that other stuff.

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,580
So what you're telling me is that we come still blank slate pretty much at that point.

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,380
OK.

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,840
OK.

80
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,320
Go ahead.

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,380
We're like those empty hard cases or whatever, but we will adapt to whatever food we eat.

82
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,660
You know how they show the eagle being very noble, you know, on the American thing or whatever.

83
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,260
I don't know if anyone's lived in an area where the eagles are naturally, you know,

84
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,220
inhabitant.

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,280
You know, I stayed up in the White Mountains in Arizona and they have a very large eagle

86
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,020
population.

87
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,400
I've seen them try to hunt at the lake and all that.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,160
But most of the time they were scavengers.

89
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,760
What do I mean?

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,480
You leave the garbage can lid open.

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,340
An eagle will go into it.

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
There's roadkill.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,980
An eagle will go eat it.

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
It sounds like seagulls, man.

95
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Seagulls do the same thing.

96
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,760
Yeah, exactly.

97
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,600
Very much so.

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,100
So they're scavengers.

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,940
But it doesn't sound very noble if you call them a scavenger.

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,640
So anyway.

102
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,200
Yeah.

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,700
So we've got that trade as well.

104
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,520
But yeah, I just want to bring up the food part is very important because it's what you

105
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,460
are, what you ate.

106
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,220
And you kind of go that way regardless, you know, whether if you if you want to eat well

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,220
or not, you're going to, you know, anyway, you know, it's about blood quality, really.

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,760
Well, yeah.

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,440
But you don't need to feed this to your cat, though.

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,900
You know, I mean, right.

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,220
They'll eat it.

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,940
They'll eat it.

113
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,580
Yeah.

114
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,040
Well, you know, I remember hanging out in Manhattan near Thompson Square Park and the

115
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,860
Krishnas would show up in their school bus every so often and give out free food.

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,260
Yeah.

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,860
Once a week.

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
Once a week they sit down.

119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,700
And if you'll sit and listen to their thing, they will bring out a tin of completely vegetarian

120
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,220
food.

121
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,180
In Tompkins Square.

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,500
Yeah.

123
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,060
Right there on Avenue A.

124
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,320
And they park along Avenue A facing south and they come out and they play, you know, the

125
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,380
little finger drums and they're chanting and serve food.

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,940
And it was the most delicious food I've ever eaten.

127
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,900
We're talking like 1986.

128
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,520
Right.

129
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,940
Yeah.

130
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,620
Well, even still in the 90s, because I live between 1st and A on 9th Street.

131
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,500
And believe me, I could just walk right there every I think it was every Thursday they were

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,840
there.

133
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,900
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,020
Once a week, roughly.

135
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,360
Yeah.

136
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,160
I was on 11th Street between 2nd and 3rd.

137
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
There you go.

138
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,560
Not too far.

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,540
You and I could have been the same bodegas, except it was a decade apart.

140
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,920
But good.

141
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,660
Yeah.

142
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,180
Anyway.

143
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,800
And the food was I was like, my gosh, this is so delicious.

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,160
You know, I realized right there, you know, so the veg, you know, being total veg, only

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,520
veg, there's no onion, you know, they use hang, you know, because the onion sucks your spirit

146
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,440
right down and all this.

147
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,400
But anyway, I was talking to one of them.

148
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,060
So once food is really good, it says, yeah, it's spiced in a way that only humans would

149
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,240
eat.

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,580
In other words, so what do you mean if you're eating this at the beach and you threw it

151
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,380
on the sand, the seagulls, you know, the crabs or wouldn't eat it.

152
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,020
So they have a spice profile that is strictly for humans.

153
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,420
It's just, you know, that's the spirit, you know, the mental notion behind it.

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,160
Right.

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,680
So it's spice specifically the Vedic way.

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,220
Vedic means knowledge, by the way.

157
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
That only fit for human.

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,140
Again, if you scavenger would not find it appropriate.

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,420
So that's why that came up because you asked if you could feed it to the cats.

160
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,200
And I was like, well, if you really do Vedic food that's tailored for just humans, you

161
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,640
know, tailored specifically, you know, we're talking about traditions that go thousands

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,120
of years.

163
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,640
The cat wouldn't eat it.

164
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,460
The dog wouldn't eat it.

165
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
The seagull wouldn't eat it.

166
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,600
The mouse, the rat wouldn't eat it.

167
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:12,820
Right.

168
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,700
So that's another level.

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
And this is sort of on that level, but without spices.

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,100
And again, when I speak about microbiotics, I really don't like using that term because

171
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,040
they're very dogmatic.

172
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,140
If you watch some of the Michio Kushi, one of his last lectures, he starts bringing up

173
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
stuff that he was against.

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,900
Or, you know, it seems like people get to the end of their life and they realize that

175
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,440
it's time to loosen up a little.

176
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,400
You know, so I never I never bought whenever I heard dogma and rigidity.

177
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,200
I always called it out and I never went for that.

178
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,600
So hence the lascivious comments once in a while.

179
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,460
But yeah, what I wanted to talk about was I noticed that.

180
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,560
OK, what do we do?

181
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,160
Let's go back.

182
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,880
OK, let's go back to what you said.

183
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,500
What do we do about Christmas without getting or what you do is very simple.

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:00,820
OK.

185
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,660
Somebody wished me Merry Christmas the other day.

186
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,480
And I said, you too.

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,180
But I want to tell you, I reap the I reap the benefits of it, but I don't fall for I have

188
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,700
without getting the pitfalls.

189
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,100
Right.

190
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,920
And the person didn't want me to explain what that was.

191
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,660
So, in other words, let's say there's a big part.

192
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's just do it this way.

193
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,480
This is a big party in the middle of the week that everyone does for the great pumpkin in

194
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,980
the sky.

195
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,299
And every middle of the week or right before the middle of the week, everybody gathers

196
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:36,240
and they bring out they have to cook organic, delicious food for the great pumpkin in the

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,539
sky.

198
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,900
So go ahead and eat some of it and you get the benefits.

199
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,620
But when it comes time to do reaching to your pocket for the great pumpkin in the sky.

200
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,080
No.

201
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,300
When it comes time to write, do all these other things for the to support the great

202
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,320
pumpkin in the sky organization, you tell them, fuck yourself.

203
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,720
Right.

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,360
But when they're giving out stuff for free and having a good time, you go there.

205
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,080
Right.

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
So what you're saying is I can go to a birthday party, but I don't have to participate in

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,380
the ritual or give a crap about that.

208
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah.

209
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Go and I'll bring a gift or anything.

210
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,660
Yeah.

211
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,860
So if you go to a Christmas party, it's packed with people.

212
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,260
Cop a couple of feels on, you know, and then leave.

213
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,160
Have some pizza, have a couple of drinks, even a piece of cake.

214
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,420
Yeah.

215
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,580
And then take off.

216
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,940
But don't participate in the game is what you're saying.

217
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,820
Right.

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,220
In other words, reap the benefits without those also.

219
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,600
Right.

220
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,780
Without without having to feed the monster.

221
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,180
Right.

222
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay.

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,920
Fair enough.

224
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,640
So my apologies for your squeak in the back, because I do have a box full of puppies.

225
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,620
I got seven puppies, little itty bitties.

226
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,540
Again, a couple of days.

227
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,420
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:35,880
Yeah.

229
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,020
I got a house full of dogs.

230
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,520
Yeah.

231
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,020
Just you wait.

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,840
Actually, about four weeks, they get even more chewable.

233
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,360
They'll find any anything that's below waist height.

234
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,180
They're going to chew on.

235
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
You know, I absolutely know.

236
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,040
That's why I'm going to try and find homes for them.

237
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,980
They're mighty many months.

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,740
But anyway, sorry.

239
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,940
I just want to know about clothing, laundry, anything, you know, armrests on chairs.

240
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,860
If it smells like oil or an animal, they will eat it.

241
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,740
Yeah.

242
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,280
So, yeah, I know.

243
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,540
I know.

244
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,040
But anyway, I was just so squeaky noise.

245
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,320
Sorry.

246
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,720
Go ahead.

247
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,280
Yes.

248
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,880
A very simple like, you know, someone gave me these to give me Christmas gifts.

249
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,500
And I said, look, I'll take you can transmute these things to here's a birthday gift or

250
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,280
a Christmas gift.

251
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,340
I say, well, look, I'll receive it if it's true as tribute.

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,880
Right.

253
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,300
It's OK.

254
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,120
How would you would would you give it to me as tribute?

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,280
Well, let's say yes.

256
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
They just transmuted.

257
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,960
It's no longer.

258
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,640
And you know what tribute is.

259
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:31,840
Right.

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, hang on.

261
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,760
I mean, let's put a pin in tribute because I want to continue on with this concept.

262
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Let's get back to tribute in a minute, because what you're saying is to this person who's

263
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,780
worried about the fact that he's got people with Christmas all around him is that he could

264
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,880
participate in, you know, getting the benefits of it, like you said.

265
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,320
But he doesn't have to embrace the ritual.

266
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,300
Now, does that mean.

267
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,620
Right.

268
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,540
No, you're not participating in the ritual.

269
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,760
See, if you're just going there to reap the benefits, you sound like the IRS now.

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:10:59,980
Right.

271
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,220
Well, what I mean is you're just taking the benefits.

272
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,060
You're not taking you're participating in the ritual at all because part of the participation

273
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,240
is give and take.

274
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
You're just going there to take.

275
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,000
They're stupid enough to do that.

276
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,380
They're definitely stupid enough for you to take and not give them anything.

277
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,500
So let me say, OK, OK, when you run into what you're doing business, if you run into someone

278
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,580
who's a bonafide sucker, in other words, they whatever color their skin is, they've got

279
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,640
sucker in all caps, tattooed on their forehead, the same color of their skin.

280
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,400
You know, I'm talking about.

281
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,860
Oh, yeah.

282
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,240
OK.

283
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,820
OK.

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,280
Right.

285
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,540
So white guy would have sucker tattooed in white.

286
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,900
Right.

287
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,900
On his forehead.

288
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,820
Someone I once said so is I didn't see such a sucker tattooed on the forehead.

289
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,800
So like, hey, dummy, I mean, because, you know, for sure.

290
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,340
OK, you take their money.

291
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,080
Why?

292
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,160
Because if you don't take their money, they're a sucker.

293
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,480
Remember, they're going to give it to someone else.

294
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,720
They'll find somebody.

295
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,760
And it's better than you take it than someone else, because they're going to lose their

296
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,420
money anyway.

297
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
Well, OK, I understand that.

298
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,260
And believe me, I heard that mentality said to me several times from various Italian businessmen.

299
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,420
But the thing, you know, because that's the deal.

300
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Look, if they're not going to give it to me, they're going to give it to somebody else

301
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,100
anyway.

302
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,380
So you might as well be.

303
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah.

304
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,080
And that's how I was taught when I was young.

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
But another thing I was taught when I was young, which I want to run by you in this

306
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,840
context is I always was taught to to try and be respectful of where other people are at.

307
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,060
If you're going to deal with them, if you're actually going to do business with them or

308
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,860
interact now on one level, when you're going and you're dealing with a cashier, you're

309
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,740
doing business with them.

310
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,920
Right.

311
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,620
It's not their business, but their job is there.

312
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,260
That's what they're occupied with.

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,860
So, you know, you get through there politely by acknowledging stuff.

314
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,700
Right.

315
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, I used to say assalamu alaikum to people who were Muslims and I'm not a Muslim.

316
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,800
I never have been.

317
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,380
Not even close.

318
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,820
You do that out of respect.

319
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,500
I think I mentioned a Korean client here shy on the English.

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,580
And I said, oh, I'm going to come here to hang some artwork.

321
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,300
His wife's relatives were old Korean royalty before the Americans got there.

322
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,900
And they had some priceless stuff they wanted hung.

323
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,260
Anyway, I learned some Korean when I went there just out of respect.

324
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,440
And he felt so comfortable.

325
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,540
He was so uptight with everyone.

326
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,340
But he was very comfortable with me because I just took some time out.

327
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,420
I mean, you can make somebody happy if they don't, you know, English is not their first

328
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,600
language and you learn to just say simple things like that.

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,380
You do it out of respect, just like you send a diplomat right over or representative.

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,060
Right.

331
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,500
But you simple, you know, thank you.

332
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,320
Excuse me.

333
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,200
And how are you today, sir?

334
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,340
You know, basic stuff.

335
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,100
If you learn that in their language, it's a way of showing respect and it's a way of

336
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,020
making them more comfortable.

337
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,380
But that's not acquiescing to all of their rituals.

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,720
Right.

339
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,920
I mean, so where's the line is what I'm getting.

340
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,140
No, I won't eat dog.

341
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,440
Like.

342
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,620
All right.

343
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,300
Give me an example.

344
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,200
Like, I'm very fond of the Vietnamese.

345
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,260
I've worked with Vietnamese.

346
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:50,860
Right.

347
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,200
Sure.

348
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,940
And I could kick it in Vietnamese.

349
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,480
And very often with when I'm with the wife or I say, watch this.

350
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
And she knows what I'm going to ask.

351
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm going to say, I'm going to tell.

352
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,160
And basically, that means, do you eat dog?

353
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,620
And they say sometimes, like, can you please say it again?

354
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,780
And they're like, no way.

355
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,500
Nobody else around us knows what I asked.

356
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,180
Or sometimes they'll say not here, meaning in the US.

357
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:21,740
Right.

358
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,840
Right.

359
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,140
And I'm like, whoa, that's cool.

360
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,660
He's honest.

361
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,000
Right.

362
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,620
So he does eat dog, but not here.

363
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,420
Right.

364
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,940
Honk again.

365
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,380
So anyway, it's a very simple language.

366
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,400
But so.

367
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,240
Well, I read it.

368
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:38,860
I read it.

369
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,660
Take whatever you want.

370
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,600
It's give and take.

371
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:40,840
Right.

372
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,040
But in this case, you're just going to go there and reap the benefit.

373
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,940
Look, if they're stupid enough to do it, that's what I'm going to get into.

374
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,900
Let's get into.

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Let's just segue.

376
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,780
Because this is better.

377
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,500
This is better.

378
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:50,780
Sure.

379
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,580
Let's segue.

380
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,600
OK, so you've got you've subverted the power structure of one country.

381
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,400
You're a private group.

382
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,380
No one knows who you are.

383
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,460
I was talking about someone asked me, what about Elon Musk?

384
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,560
Elon Musk existed as Elon Musk.

385
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,920
Everything.

386
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,780
Everyone talks about him 50 years before he was born.

387
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,800
He just fits the role.

388
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,000
He has a handler.

389
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,020
And the moment Elon Musk says, I don't want to play anymore.

390
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,500
Suddenly, every news station is going to have the same story that they found cocaine like

391
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,680
DeLorean on him.

392
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,020
Right.

393
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,820
Or child porn or somebody.

394
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,680
He raped four women.

395
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,460
Something terrible is going to remove three women.

396
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,320
See, they do this with rock stars, too.

397
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,520
The same thing with rock stars.

398
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,480
Like for a little while, they influence the culture.

399
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,700
They are the king of the genre.

400
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,920
They are the pop star.

401
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,300
No, no.

402
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,480
They do that with everyone.

403
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,560
I brought up DeLorean because when I bring up cocaine, that was that time.

404
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,560
Now, they wouldn't do cocaine.

405
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
They would do other things that socially, you know, in the in the mix.

406
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,580
Right.

407
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,080
Because in the 80s, cocaine was in the mix.

408
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,140
Cocaine is an 80s thing.

409
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,480
But that's a hell of a drug.

410
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,280
Is that by the way?

411
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,700
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

412
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,300
Rick James.

413
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,680
Look at this thing.

414
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
He fit perfectly with that.

415
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,340
Anyway, look, what I'm saying is, though, is that there are certain roles out there

416
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,440
where there are people like that.

417
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,400
And it's not about the person exactly.

418
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,160
It's about the role.

419
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,020
Donald Trump.

420
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,520
Hold on.

421
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,060
Donald Trump.

422
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,080
That's why when you were going off with this lady that's got a New York accent all the

423
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
time about Donald Trump, I tuned in.

424
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,220
I was like, oh, my gosh, Chuck, don't you know that Donald Trump is a puppet?

425
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,680
He's a TV actor.

426
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:18,880
Right.

427
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,940
Just like the rest of them.

428
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,120
Right.

429
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,180
That's my point about the guy, actually.

430
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,880
It's exactly my point about it.

431
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,800
But so is the one with a New York accent.

432
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,400
You want to see a real TV actor before there was TV?

433
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,060
Sure.

434
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,500
There's a there's there's a YouTube video.

435
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:32,720
Lift up.

436
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,680
I think it's Coolidge.

437
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,540
He was one of the.

438
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,820
Maybe not Coolidge.

439
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,500
Maybe.

440
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,400
No, it wasn't cool.

441
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,900
One of these presidents in the 1920s, an early film, not 1920s, 1930s.

442
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,760
It's a film on YouTube.

443
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,280
Very short.

444
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,020
President U.S. talks about people should start filing to the IRS.

445
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,920
And he looks like a zombie.

446
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,080
He's like, do you remember the the trope with Bill Clinton?

447
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,540
They're putting makeup on him.

448
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,680
He looks like he's in a trance.

449
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,680
Talk about MK Ultra.

450
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,100
Right.

451
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,540
Oh, yeah.

452
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,300
I'm almost certain you're talking about Woodrow Wilson.

453
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,800
But go ahead.

454
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,020
No, it wasn't Wilson.

455
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,180
It was after his two presidents after Wilson.

456
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,579
It was before Roosevelt, I think, or after Roosevelt.

457
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,940
No, it's before Roosevelt because after Roosevelt was the Truman Eisenhower stuff.

458
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,280
Right.

459
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,460
Before Hoover.

460
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,280
It wasn't Hoover.

461
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,640
It was somebody early on between Wilson.

462
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,040
It's a film because it's very rare.

463
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,119
And he's like a zombie and he's looking like.

464
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,780
Right.

465
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,119
So there are George Washington.

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,400
OK.

467
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,500
Sorry, George Washington.

468
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:28,160
He was killed early on in the Revolutionary War.

469
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,900
They found his body frozen solid.

470
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,000
They buried him right where the monument is in Brooklyn at Brooklyn Heights.

471
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,080
There is a little monument right by the promenade.

472
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,940
And it's a tribute to where the battle of Brooklyn, a battle of where the British chased

473
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,420
them out.

474
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,140
Right.

475
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,580
Well, anyway, they went back.

476
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,500
There was a battle anyway.

477
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,220
They replaced George Washington with a lookalike.

478
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,600
The problem was the lookalike didn't have any teeth in his mouth.

479
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,480
So they spent so much effort to put teeth in his mouth.

480
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,860
Right.

481
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,400
Right.

482
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,340
It's like George Washington lost all his teeth.

483
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,140
Wait a second.

484
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,420
And then when he started going to the Freemasonic rituals, he was like, you know, I'm tired of

485
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,700
this.

486
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,440
Guess what?

487
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,380
They bled him to death.

488
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,700
Right.

489
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,520
The the the the the second one.

490
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:09,900
Right.

491
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,520
So this has been going on for a while.

492
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,560
Another thing, Napoleon.

493
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Napoleon was not banished to an island and died.

494
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,320
He had a brother who looked just like him.

495
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,820
His brother took his place and Napoleon came to the US and lived here, you know, because

496
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,000
Incidentally, Taft is the only guy in between.

497
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,480
Theodore.

498
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,280
It must have been.

499
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,720
Thank you.

500
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,000
It's probably Taft.

501
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,260
Yeah.

502
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,500
OK.

503
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:31,900
Yeah.

504
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
It must be Taft.

505
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,120
Go watch it.

506
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,860
It's a YouTube video.

507
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,560
Find it.

508
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,300
Talking about people will follow.

509
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,600
Everybody laughed at that.

510
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:37,820
Right.

511
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,280
OK.

512
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,300
And that's what the IRS does, by the way.

513
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,240
They find people that are high every 10 years.

514
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,540
They get someone that's high profile and they beat him up in public.

515
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,040
And we talked about this to get everyone scared.

516
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,340
Right.

517
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,660
Right.

518
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,180
OK.

519
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,780
But that's not what I wanted to talk about.

520
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,120
Let's go back because it sounds like a mega tangent.

521
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,540
And I and I do go on mega tangents.

522
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,320
But it's OK.

523
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,680
So go around to the same thing.

524
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,340
So we're getting there.

525
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,060
Don't worry about it.

526
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,420
Yeah.

527
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,760
OK.

528
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,740
So you're you're a private group.

529
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,140
And when people when you have someone ask you, who is their handler?

530
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,520
Says once you find out who they are, they're no longer a handler.

531
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:08,880
Right.

532
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,680
So this group has been running this influencing.

533
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,300
There are several groups.

534
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,260
The power structure of a nation.

535
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,800
Well, could they they successfully do one, two, three, four, five, six.

536
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,960
And they now they've got been running for over 150 years.

537
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,540
All the power structures of all the nations.

538
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,780
Right now, all the puppets that are the government's kings, whatever.

539
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,620
And some of the kings and people didn't want to play.

540
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,500
So between the 1700s and the World War II, they got rid of all the monarchies and all

541
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,140
that stuff, too.

542
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,420
And if any monarchy that's left is down with them.

543
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,620
Right.

544
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,060
So anyway.

545
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,440
What they do is when they're in control, you need a security structure and a

546
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,520
policing structure to make sure that when you give an order, it's done.

547
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,560
And if it starts to not be done, how do you structure?

548
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,200
You know, what kind of enforcement structure do you have?

549
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,500
Right.

550
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,660
So you have to.

551
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,940
That's why I always refer to them as policy enforcers, because police.

552
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,700
No, no, no.

553
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,900
That's what they do.

554
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,780
That's what they do.

555
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,200
No, no, no.

556
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,020
That's way down.

557
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,120
That's the secondary group.

558
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm talking about the primary group.

559
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,560
Now, the primary group that runs all the governments behind the scenes also need a

560
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,100
security apparatus and an enforcement apparatus.

561
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,960
So all the state departments and presidents do their thing right now.

562
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,760
If you're going to develop an apparatus like that, you have to learn how much you

563
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,620
have to find out.

564
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,060
Engage.

565
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,300
How much do you invest in that apparatus apparatus?

566
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,540
Because it's intelligence agencies also.

567
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:29,920
Right.

568
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,120
And then eventually you'll find out it's also the schools and it's the churches

569
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,320
and it's the media.

570
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,340
Right.

571
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,120
And when I say schools, I mean universities also, because when you have a grade

572
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,880
school teachers teaching, they usually have the college degrees.

573
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,040
So you got to get them there.

574
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,100
So you to find that instead of setting up a separate security apparatus or

575
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,760
whatever, how much how much discernment the population has, what you do is you

576
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,780
start putting out total bullshit information, stuff that is unfounded.

577
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,120
And you see what the reaction in public is.

578
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,140
Will they go for it?

579
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,540
Like you tell them there's a big bang.

580
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,300
The sky is blue because it reflects the color of the ocean.

581
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,000
Right.

582
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,920
You tell them that, you know, you absorb nutrition through the intestine.

583
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,880
You tell them they have an electron that spins around the atom and it's a slow,

584
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,300
slow cousin, the proton and its fat brother, the neutron.

585
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,580
It's all stupid.

586
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,520
I mean, stuff that, you know, is beyond any reason.

587
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,600
Right. And you watch the reaction.

588
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,860
You watch the reaction.

589
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,300
If everybody absorbs all that and goes along with it, you need a minimal

590
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,700
security policing apparatus, minimal.

591
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,060
Absolutely.

592
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,960
If you tell them everybody get on the roof on Monday.

593
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,200
And what do we do now?

594
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
Tune in at seven.

595
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,220
All right.

596
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,360
Now jump 40 percent of the population that jump off the bill.

597
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,880
Wow.

598
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,480
Do we need to start enforcing and policing?

599
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,380
It's like a percentage of people that when they said, you know, AIDS is this

600
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
big disease that's killing you.

601
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,160
Well, what happens?

602
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,160
What does the disease do?

603
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,660
Well, nothing.

604
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,000
It actually doesn't do anything.

605
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,260
Other diseases kill you.

606
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,180
The disease is ignorance.

607
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,000
If you cure ignorance, there'll be no AIDS.

608
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, there is.

609
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,720
There is STDs.

610
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,240
That's different.

611
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,020
No, no, no, no, no.

612
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,940
There's plenty of those.

613
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,640
There's like 18 different varieties.

614
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,920
But what I'm saying is that most people get STDs, get the treatment for AIDS

615
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,260
and they tell them they died of AIDS, which actually died from the epithelial

616
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
drugs from the problem, from the treatment.

617
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,860
It's the treatment that kills you, not the illness.

618
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,040
Yeah. The treatment, again, just to reiterate, when a cell is replaced in

619
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,000
the body, you have cells that replace themselves in 30 minutes.

620
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
You have other cells that take seven years to replace.

621
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,600
It releases a hormone.

622
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,420
It's a form of whatever you want to call it.

623
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,640
A simple way to say it's a hormone to let the body know, hey, I'm replaced.

624
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
So what they do is they give you that hormone.

625
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,080
So when the cell naturally dies and falls off, when you take that hormone, it

626
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,000
thinks the cell has been replaced and it hasn't.

627
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,540
So it stops growing new cells, whatever region of the body.

628
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,700
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,660
So you look like you've got a starvation diet.

630
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,000
You start getting sores and most likely your lungs will fall apart and die of

631
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,020
pneumonia, which are typical.

632
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,080
Or if you're very young, you'll have these fat tumors develop that will kill

633
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,340
you. All right.

634
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,060
I mean, if you're two years old and you get a fat tumor in your head the size

635
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,980
of an orange, it'll kill you.

636
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,000
Right. So this is how they're killing people and getting away with it.

637
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,400
And the doctors, they know this, by the way.

638
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,800
The ones that are at the top of this, they know.

639
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,460
And by the way, how do you know AIDS is a total scam?

640
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,000
Most doctors did not find about it through a medical journal.

641
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,880
They found about it like everybody else watching television in 1980.

642
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,960
Yeah. Watching the.

643
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,140
And then they went watching TV.

644
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,120
They're like, what's this?

645
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,480
And they start then they started the ones that inquired, they fed them the

646
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,060
bullshit. There is no study, medical study on that, that the doctors received.

647
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
They got it just like right.

648
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,420
They got it like everybody got 9-11 and covid.

649
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,500
No. And I recently tried to on TV.

650
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,540
I recently tried to explain this to somebody.

651
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,200
And to tell you the truth, the conversation ended with me saying, you know,

652
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,740
what you're talking about is hepatitis.

653
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,500
It's not even this imaginary AIDS.

654
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,160
And besides.

655
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,700
But what is hepatitis?

656
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,420
It's a it's a pathogen pathological condition of what?

657
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,400
The liver.

658
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,460
Yeah, exactly.

659
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,640
But that's the thing.

660
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,820
And but liver pathologies.

661
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,740
It's not AIDS.

662
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,900
It's just over and over.

663
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,940
They're telling me all these different symptoms of what happens.

664
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,440
And I said, those are the behaviors.

665
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,300
The behaviors, the exposure, everything is the same as.

666
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,300
So what do you think?

667
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,060
AIDS is not.

668
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,800
But hold on.

669
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,460
AIDS is not AIDS.

670
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,180
There is no immune system.

671
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,360
If you ask someone to explain the immune system.

672
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,840
Good luck.

673
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,140
You know what they're really explaining?

674
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:42,880
No.

675
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
What they're really explaining is the eliminative system.

676
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,640
Yeah.

677
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,640
But that's the thing that filters things out, which again, gets back to what?

678
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,840
No, there's no filtering.

679
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,760
There's no filtering.

680
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,880
Well, it's the elimination system.

681
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,020
But that's what I grab it.

682
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,340
OK.

683
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,760
OK.

684
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,740
How do they do garbage in Star Trek?

685
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,040
They open the thing and dump it out or they put it on the transporter and send it somewhere

686
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,960
through the transporter.

687
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,000
No, but that's my point, is that it's through a system that grabs all the crap and takes

688
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,820
it out and does what?

689
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,640
Sends it out.

690
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,400
Sends it out.

691
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,280
It literally does not take anything.

692
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,720
It sends it out.

693
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,260
In other words, it reproduces it on the specific body parts that are made to handle it.

694
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,280
The waste management part.

695
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,680
And it reproduces it in there.

696
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,780
So in other words, yeah.

697
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
In other words, the induction works both ways.

698
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,320
I hope people got that.

699
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,480
I've never really got into, you know, I only got into showing the stark example of nothing

700
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,920
passing through the intestinal lumina, intestinal walls into the body.

701
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,380
What happens is the right is it's by induction.

702
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,140
The food actually de-energizes into the blood vessels around the intestines.

703
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:47,700
Right.

704
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,840
But I never got into how things get out.

705
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,000
They get out the same way.

706
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,880
Right.

707
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,120
The pores in the skin develop moisture inside of them, just like a thundercloud develops

708
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,760
rain before it.

709
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:57,960
Right.

710
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,080
And then it's ejected.

711
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,780
And that energy that's required to create that material as waste is gotten from the

712
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,940
right makes the stuff on the inside disappear.

713
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,240
And isn't that another that's another kind of induction anyway, because look, when you

714
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,880
look at a big old cloud over your head, it's not carrying around millions of gallons of

715
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,140
water.

716
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,480
No, it couldn't.

717
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,360
It would be fog.

718
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,160
It would hit the ground just at 27 feet per second.

719
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Right.

720
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,400
Because that's actually towards the ground at 27 feet per second, because that's actual

721
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,220
water in the air.

722
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,800
When you got water in the air, it becomes a mist or a fog.

723
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,940
And that's different because that's that's there.

724
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,860
That's water vapor.

725
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,180
Yeah.

726
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,520
There is no water in the cloud.

727
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:32,920
Right.

728
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,100
Like I mean, as such.

729
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,600
Right.

730
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,380
OK.

731
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,060
Anyway, sorry.

732
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,460
Sorry.

733
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,380
We got away from this whole thing with Christmas and the cashiers.

734
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,980
And again, you know, when so the when they're saying to you, have a nice day because they

735
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,140
intuitively have picked up.

736
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,920
Maybe this isn't the guy to bring it to.

737
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,160
Now, I'm sure that doesn't work 100 percent of the time.

738
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Sometimes somebody will say to you, Merry Christmas or whatever, because they're on

739
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,660
auto.

740
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,380
Right.

741
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,500
I mean, they're not really.

742
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,120
No, we didn't.

743
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,820
We didn't get away.

744
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,020
No.

745
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,300
This is part of the security apparatus.

746
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,040
It's part of the security apparatus.

747
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,600
In other words, everybody, if you watch a documentary on Christmas Day, tell you everybody

748
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,560
knows that it's not December 25th when J.E.S.

749
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,420
U.S. was born.

750
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,300
But it's a pagan holiday.

751
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,460
The biggest Christmas documentaries on PBS say that just like when they bring up dinosaurs.

752
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
It was 60 million years ago.

753
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,340
Now it's 65.

754
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,560
And then it became recently 66.

755
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:22,940
Right.

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,000
Because six, six is very important.

757
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,100
By the way, I recently talked to someone who was teaching a yoga class and what and they

758
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,240
specifically said no refunds.

759
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,480
But a woman decided her church told her while she was taking the classes that it's satanic

760
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,540
and not to do it.

761
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,180
And he didn't want to have problems with her.

762
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,400
He said, you know, there's no refund.

763
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,400
You agreed to that.

764
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,640
But, you know, I'll give you if you think it's satanic.

765
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,660
I'll do a religious exemption kind of thing.

766
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,680
I'll give you your money back.

767
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,720
So he reaches into his checkbook and refunds her the the refunds her the tuition because

768
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,900
she thought in her church told her was satanic two weeks into the classes.

769
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,040
And guess what number was with an off plan.

770
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,640
Guess what number you get one guess.

771
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,520
The check number was six, six, six.

772
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,780
That's right.

773
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,680
That's right.

774
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,600
And he gave it and she didn't say anything.

775
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,520
She didn't notice.

776
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
And she cashed it.

777
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,020
So how funny can it be?

778
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,720
So you see that you see the side, the different sides to this.

779
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,020
Right.

780
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,780
I mean, it flips, you know, yin and yang.

781
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,040
Right.

782
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,660
Well, yeah.

783
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,880
And there's always an irony attached to any of this stuff, which which is always hilarious

784
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,320
to me.

785
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,660
Like a lot of times the people that think that they, you know, suddenly struck it rich, but

786
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,480
they did it through, you know, ill gotten means.

787
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,880
They often pay for it because.

788
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,500
Yeah.

789
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,520
But look, let's let's go back to the whole thing.

790
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,340
So they put this false narrative out.

791
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,560
It's been going on for thousands of years and everybody goes for it because it's a good

792
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:41,840
time.

793
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,680
All right.

794
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,320
So now if you want to do another narrative that you're going to have to wear a mask because

795
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,940
they got these little viruses around, are you worried about people not believing it?

796
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,800
I don't know.

797
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,180
They're going to believe it.

798
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,480
So it's part the Christmas, the covid, the 9-11, all of that is part of the inner core

799
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,020
security apparatus to test and see now what happens when you have people that don't go

800
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,300
for it.

801
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,380
Oh, there are the whack jobs.

802
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,700
There are the nut jobs.

803
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,360
They're ignorant.

804
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,420
They're not trained.

805
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,520
Right.

806
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,700
Or.

807
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,880
And the ultimate is, oh, they're terrorists.

808
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,300
Right.

809
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,740
That's the worst.

810
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,240
Right.

811
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,500
Being called a terrorist now.

812
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,760
Right.

813
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,160
So.

814
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,040
So this is part of the security apparatus has been going on for a long, long time.

815
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:28,040
So instead of looking at it as Christmas holiday or covid or AIDS or you got to pay taxes or

816
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,180
whatever, it's part of the security apparatus, which, by the way, speaking of the trigger

817
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:39,400
word terrorist, just really quickly, I was looking at a documentary on Vietnam and, you

818
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,340
know, the U.S. military.

819
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,360
And it's so funny to me that they were using pretty much the same terms that they were

820
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,780
and calling the Vietnamese terrorists, by the way, the North Vietnamese, they were

821
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,040
terrorists.

822
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,260
Good.

823
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,680
Yeah.

824
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,060
Before.

825
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,100
Yeah.

826
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,880
It started after the 50s.

827
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,400
Yeah.

828
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,260
In the 60s.

829
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:56,840
Right.

830
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,540
Yeah.

831
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,120
Before that, they called them insurgents or whatever.

832
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,600
You know, most people think they mixed it around.

833
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,560
But what I'm saying is when when they started to battle it and they started making these

834
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,420
films in the early 60s and they were talking about the stuff that had gone on just post

835
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,000
World War Two, which is when the conflict actually started in Vietnam, you know, with

836
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,840
the French and all that.

837
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,520
And we had been food.

838
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,880
But anyway, the bottom line is that they were saying that our special forces were there

839
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,460
to do what?

840
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,880
Battle terrorists.

841
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,120
It was the same kind of thing that they said that we had to do in Iraq.

842
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,740
And it's just it's just the same story recycled.

843
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,560
I mean, history.

844
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
People think it's a different.

845
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Well, that was a different thing.

846
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,360
They were fighting fighting communism.

847
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:32,960
Yeah.

848
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
But if you take a look at the motivator, it's the terrorists again.

849
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,880
It's always the terrorists.

850
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,840
Well, no, it's a new thing.

851
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,320
You know how things change, like, you know, the Civil War was the war of northern aggression.

852
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,920
And then in the late 1800s, it became the War of the States.

853
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,060
And by the 1920s, it was the Civil War.

854
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,540
Well, what I'm saying is in the modern age, in the modern age where we're, you know, disseminating

855
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,600
things by, you know, what's the next bad word?

856
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,320
The next bad word is going to be something religious.

857
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,800
It's going to be some religious connotation.

858
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,660
I don't know what it is.

859
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm sure it's out there already.

860
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,460
Pick one.

861
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:04,880
Yeah.

862
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,920
And if you stay, it's going to be based on, quote, unquote, your faith or allegiance or

863
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,700
like allegiance.

864
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,820
That's what religion is.

865
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,080
But again, all of these things that you see and now it's gotten to the point where pretty

866
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,800
much all of it is false.

867
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,220
Right.

868
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,680
If if you don't if you hear if you if it's not a report of a dump truck falling over

869
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:32,000
on I-10 or I-95 or someone getting hit with a, you know, baseball bat in a parking lot,

870
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,640
it's false.

871
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,020
Right.

872
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,280
You know that we know that already, because if you bring this up to, you know, people

873
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,040
like like let's go back to you said the Vietnam recently, I was one of these Vietnam vet morons

874
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,320
in there.

875
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Seventy six years old.

876
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,740
He's actually an inventor and I've known him for almost 20 years and I brought up the draft

877
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,380
is voluntary.

878
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,700
You just don't know what part of the process you're going to be volunteering.

879
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,940
He couldn't remember.

880
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,040
I said when they draft you, it's still voluntary.

881
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,140
It doesn't sound like it because, you know, they have to make you feel, you know, little

882
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,800
and fearful.

883
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,380
But when they've got you standing there after the medical checkup, the physical checkup,

884
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,680
they have everybody walk into a side room in their drawers and in their shirts, underwear

885
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,380
and socks.

886
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,780
And they say, OK, everyone that is going to join the army, take one step forward and everyone

887
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,400
takes a step forward without thinking.

888
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,700
But if you just stand there and don't take that step forward, they have a sergeant come

889
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,740
up to your face and yell at you.

890
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,380
What's wrong with you?

891
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,720
And if you put up with that, they pull you to the side, they say, get your clothes on,

892
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,760
they give you 20 bucks for your bus fare home.

893
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,500
Yep, and they have you down, I forgot what it's called, medically unfit or something,

894
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,260
but it doesn't look bad on your record.

895
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,100
One of these medical.

896
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,340
In other words, you got discharged at the medical point, not at the performance, you

897
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,520
know?

898
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,220
Yeah.

899
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,600
So anyway, and basically says, well, I saw he's like, oh, I was in whatever hostilities

900
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,180
in the field.

901
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,880
I said, I said, have you seen, I said, you were fighting on the wrong side.

902
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,100
And he says, I'm fighting on the wrong side.

903
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,120
I said, yeah, you don't want to be a loser, do you?

904
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,540
And he goes, no, we didn't lose that war.

905
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,340
Yes, you did.

906
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,200
If you even on Wikipedia says Vietnam was united under the northern Vietnam after that.

907
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,560
Right.

908
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,060
Yeah.

909
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,900
Even Wikipedia got it right.

910
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,400
And so you're basically a loser.

911
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,040
Don't you want to be a winner when you fight?

912
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,900
I mean, what you and it's like, you know, I was like, I will leave this guy alone.

913
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,300
So anyway, it's all of it is part of the security apparatus.

914
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,460
The dumbing down is part of the security apparatus.

915
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,840
It has nothing to do with dumbing you down for whatever reason.

916
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,100
Yes.

917
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,680
Rockefeller and those guys said we want Americans not to be educated.

918
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,320
We want a society of workers.

919
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,660
Right.

920
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,580
And all these other things.

921
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:38,820
Right.

922
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,020
That's also part of the thing.

923
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,200
Yeah.

924
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,040
They tell you what's going on, but it's part of the security apparatus.

925
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,960
You got to put out falsities has nothing to do with whether the information is true

926
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,480
or false.

927
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,820
But it has to be false to see what kind of reaction they get, because if the people go

928
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,400
along with the false stuff, guess what?

929
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,380
You don't have to give a reason for anything.

930
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,840
The other part I wanted to maybe a bridge, abbreviate a little bit.

931
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,960
How do they get the information across you with rhyme and reason, rationale, science,

932
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:07,480
logic?

933
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:07,880
No.

934
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,040
With images and repetition, 9-11 and repetition, images and repetition.

935
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,560
With the covid, they show you a cartoon of this little spiky thing is actually a dog

936
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:16,820
toy.

937
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,780
That looks a lot like that spiky ball.

938
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,080
Yeah.

939
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:20,980
That's true.

940
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,719
I never.

941
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,199
Wow.

942
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,100
You just snap a little on my head.

943
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,360
I never I never thought of it.

944
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,860
But you're exactly right.

945
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,199
There is a common dog toy in.

946
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,080
It's for gums.

947
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,820
It's to stimulate their gums.

948
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,460
No, it's like you think it's actually useful as a dog toy.

949
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,600
But you can see it.

950
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,560
I swear on any like any aisle in a Wal-Mart that has dog toys or if you go to any pet store

951
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,840
where they've got the plastic toys, it's probably a funky color and it's exactly this

952
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,040
thing.

953
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,139
Oh, my God.

954
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,620
Sorry.

955
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah.

956
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,960
It's supposed to stimulate because dogs typically have problems with their teeth.

957
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:55,639
Some do.

958
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,160
Anyway.

959
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,860
And years ago when someone needed a teeth cleaning, I was like, I didn't go to a dentist

960
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,420
for a teeth thing.

961
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,140
Just gave him this.

962
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,380
Your husband's got unsightly teeth.

963
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,540
Just give him a few milk bones.

964
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,120
You'll be fine.

965
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,800
Anyway.

966
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,040
So, yeah.

967
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,900
So that those were the days when, you know, somebody's talking and talking and you pull

968
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,380
a quarter out of your pocket and you hold it in front of them.

969
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,740
What's that?

970
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,560
I said, here's a quarter.

971
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,700
Call somebody who cares.

972
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:19,980
Right.

973
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,460
Oh, yeah.

974
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:20,980
Anyway.

975
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:21,920
Yeah.

976
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,000
So that was the old days.

977
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,340
Now, no one knows what the hell that means.

978
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,620
Right.

979
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,380
What do you mean?

980
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
Call what I need a quarter to call for.

981
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,160
Right.

982
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Not only that.

983
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,720
What's so what the hell is a quarter and how do you make a call with that?

984
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
It doesn't fit my cell phone.

985
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,740
Yeah.

986
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,720
You give you give someone who's under 30 one of these rotary phones and it's funnier than

987
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,580
watching a monkey try to fuck a football.

988
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,480
But anyway.

989
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,240
Anyway, did I say just say what I think I said?

990
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,900
I used too many medical terms there.

991
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,260
You did.

992
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,360
Anyway, a lot of them.

993
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:48,860
Yeah.

994
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,520
Yeah.

995
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,520
So so they're using symbols.

996
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,140
9-11.

997
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,160
Everything is a symbol.

998
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,160
So they put the symbol.

999
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,960
What's that?

1000
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,860
Oh, must be.

1001
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,280
Right.

1002
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,220
So they're like Confucius.

1003
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,520
It's not laws and words and things.

1004
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,340
It's symbols that you're controlled by.

1005
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,660
Right.

1006
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,220
You symbols and images.

1007
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,100
Thick state.

1008
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,700
So how is this done?

1009
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,460
And why is this done?

1010
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,140
Like I said before, most people are not real humans.

1011
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
There are backdrop people.

1012
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,700
Yes, they're real humans, just as much as, you know, the army of clones was in Star Wars

1013
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,140
or whatever.

1014
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Right.

1015
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,260
In other words, most of the people here are no different than as if they were grown in

1016
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,320
a tube and put out into the world as extras in this giant movie called Life on Earth.

1017
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,120
Right.

1018
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,860
They bleed and cut the same.

1019
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,300
They scream or whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

1020
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,420
So.

1021
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,240
Right.

1022
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,580
So that's all they are.

1023
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:35,720
Right.

1024
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,980
Now, if you've ever seen a big movie set when they have a lot of extras, what they do is

1025
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,660
they gather them.

1026
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,960
They have some forgot the name, the crew chief, not the crew chief.

1027
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,220
But what they do is they get the extras before shooting starts.

1028
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,860
And they do basic keywords, basic hand signals and things for what the how the people should

1029
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,440
react and be the extras.

1030
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,760
Right.

1031
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,320
Right.

1032
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,980
Very short, abridged, abbreviated signals to the crowd.

1033
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,560
So they get an idea.

1034
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,000
Right.

1035
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,240
Right.

1036
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,900
Whether it is, you know, we're filming, not filming.

1037
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,300
Do this.

1038
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,620
Do that.

1039
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:06,840
Right.

1040
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,180
OK.

1041
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,140
Just like if you've ever sat in the theater or where they're actually shooting a sitcom.

1042
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,260
Like I've been to the car when they're shooting the Kate and Ali show and the Cosby show.

1043
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,680
I was actually in the audience.

1044
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,820
And before they start the shoot, they say, OK, when you guys see this and somebody holds

1045
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,600
up a big thing that says applause.

1046
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,180
Right.

1047
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,160
What do we do?

1048
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,300
And everybody applauds.

1049
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,460
All right.

1050
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,860
Let's do it a little bit more like this.

1051
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,780
And then and then like, what does this say?

1052
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,540
Right.

1053
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,440
This is boo.

1054
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,100
What do we do?

1055
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,700
OK, good.

1056
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,820
And they do several times.

1057
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,580
People come with these signs and they walk between the aisles right in front of the audience

1058
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,360
to see what the reaction is.

1059
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,600
Right.

1060
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,080
Right.

1061
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,580
And then when they start filming, they get a live audience.

1062
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,000
Right.

1063
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,220
And then they got another signal for like, you know, a lot of action, a lot of noise.

1064
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,560
Do it.

1065
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,540
Make a lot of fuss.

1066
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,360
And they have another one where it's like everybody kind of slow down and just, you know,

1067
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,160
hang out in place.

1068
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:57,800
Yeah.

1069
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,860
Actually, I've been an extra.

1070
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,080
So, yeah, I've done this.

1071
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,340
Yeah.

1072
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:00,540
OK.

1073
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Yeah.

1074
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,820
So they do these signals.

1075
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,400
This is it.

1076
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,540
So when you look at what's put out to these morons, meaning ninety nine point nine nine

1077
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,400
nine percent of the population, doesn't matter what country, religion, color, creed or whatever.

1078
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,500
Actually, there might be quite a few people on the southern continent of Africa and eastern

1079
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,300
Congo area that actually do have the ability to think.

1080
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,840
And maybe some in the past June area of Afghanistan there that are independent thinkers still maybe.

1081
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,060
But the rest of the world doesn't work that way, the way people are told.

1082
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,760
So they are just following along exactly like extras.

1083
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,780
You need a simple image and a simple instruction.

1084
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,260
So all this stuff, if you realize that you're not part of it, there's a lot more that you

1085
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,020
can realize than they will.
