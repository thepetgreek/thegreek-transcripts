1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,400
The Sonic Event 75, rated Y. Anyway, here we are. So, looking back at a lot of different

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,520
things, not a lot of action in the chat room since we last spoke Greek, but how are you

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,060
doing today? I'm doing alright. You know, I just mentioned to you, the Sonic 73, I think,

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,400
was a doozy, I think, from memory. We really spent an hour almost talking about how energies

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,580
work, and hopefully it was helpful. And here's the thing. If, let's say, something is explained,

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,220
let's just use this general term. And when the thing is explained, someone doesn't get

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,040
it, or the people don't get it. It doesn't matter. You were exposed to it, right? It's

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,180
the start, right? So, yeah, you know how very often when people question, let's say, well,

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,280
an introduction to, let's say, something that's going to be edifying, they don't really

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,060
ask, do you know this? Have you ever heard of this? Have you been exposed to this? Right?

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,120
You see? Sometimes I get exposed to a more advanced lecture, and then I fill in some

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,960
gaps later, and then it comes, it's like, oh, yeah, that's what that was about, because

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,460
it makes more sense, because I get the more baseline information in later. It's sort of

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,280
cracking the ice.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah, the reverse order of what they do in the schools, right? Where they give you the

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,980
book, and okay, we're going to teach you the basics, and then you've got to go. Not always

17
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,460
necessarily in that order is the best way to go, is it?

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,100
Yeah, I don't think they use that word anymore. I think they're allowed to use teaching anymore,

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,540
because they don't. I think they're getting more honest, by the way.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,420
Yeah, don't say that.

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,140
No, no, no, no, it is. You just have to understand the premise. We've gone over before, the guy

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,420
who sued Fox News for libel, and the court case was thrown out, because Fox News is an

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,540
entertainment company, right?

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh, yeah, several lawsuits.

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,380
So they can't make it.

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah, several lawsuits they've had to state that, oh, look, they gave us false information.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,660
They're like, well, what do you want from us? We're an entertainment company. Exactly.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,340
Yeah, yeah, but the people go and do stuff, so the onus is up to them. Now, what happens

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,560
is there was, okay, here's another example. One of the cabinet members in Obama's cabinet,

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,280
executive cabinet, right, basically was questioned about certain policies they put in place,

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,280
and he says, look, this is all policy. If the American people are too stupid to understand

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,020
it or what to do with it, it's not my problem, right? This goes on, you know, couple that

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,720
that our job will be done when everything the American public believes is a lie, couple

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,940
that with umpty, right?

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,660
Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,020
So, yeah, so going on, let's see, I want to go back to we did a few episodes ago, a

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,520
couple of episodes ago, something I got into barely, that was the one where barely into

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,900
depth, but very much an overview, like, for example, on the medical side, to treat it

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,000
organically, if someone has a brain tumor, that is something that's going to the most

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,880
young, contractive part of the body upward, that means it has to be extremely lean. So

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,880
you would counter it with something extremely young, which would basically be the quality

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,280
of if you want to find something that's very young, what could take a lot of radiation,

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,980
that would be a cockroach. So you want to make it even more young, you carbonize his ass,

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,920
grind it up, put it in a capsule, and that will shrink the brain tumor, like nothing

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,960
else, right? Organically, naturally, right. And it has nothing to do with the chemical

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,540
if you give this to a materialist, they want to find out what chemical is doing that, right?

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,420
But they don't understand for all the here's the thing, I've talked about this before,

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,700
you know, materialistic society, they're materialistic, blah, blah, blah, blah, science or whatever.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,780
But you know, what's ironic about that they know nothing about their materials, nothing.

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,420
And what I mean by that, it's everything is basically a hydrogen compound or composite

51
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,160
compound, not the way they say compounds form. But when you put more of them together,

52
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,640
hydrogens, that is impressed them together, and they stay together, that's compounding,

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,220
right? And they don't understand that. And it's energy, not they see that they've able

54
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,980
to pull the wool over people's eyes that the elements are ephemeral, or empirical, actually,

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,160
which means you know, they don't change. They're actually ephemeral. They're all forms of hydrogen.

56
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,280
Well, here's what the biggest problem is, right? Is that, you know, even when people

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,040
take a look at okay, this worked, let's talk about the development of aspirin just really

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,900
quickly. Okay, they withdrew the chemical from a particular plant and said, Okay, this

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,420
is the chemical that seems to actually do the job.

60
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,280
Hold on, it was not the chemical at all. Let me just interrupt for a moment, like I usually

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,360
do. If you speak to any very experienced medical technician, aka known as a doctor, what they

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,500
always say, in one form or another, when, when parents with a newborn, not a newborn,

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,120
but a young child asks the doctor, is it okay to give aspirin? And they ask how old

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,180
if it's older than five, you say, you know, aspirin, in general, doesn't do any harm,

65
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,780
and it doesn't do any good. So what, what does it do? Nothing, because they took away

66
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,720
the essence, it was not chemical, but go ahead.

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,500
Well, but that was what they attempted to do, is to figure out which chemical creates

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,740
the condition that they want.

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Well, again, no, the people that originally did aspirin understood the energy aspect a

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,680
little bit more, not much more, just a little bit, a little bit more, and it went away that

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,980
people, these guys do things that are in tradition. Aspirin is considered a traditional medicine.

72
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,460
And the reason, yeah, the reason it's not available is because it's traditionally available.

73
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,660
There were other things like mercurochrome, by the way, that are taken off the market,

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,220
they said, because it was dangerous. And the way they took it off, it was so effective,

75
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,480
by the way, for cuts and wounds and things like that. It was made out of mercury and

76
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,160
chromium, which are two supposedly very toxic things. When you put them together, it forms

77
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,700
another compound, looks like iodine. What they did is they dipped a baby, a newborn baby

78
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,640
in it, and put the baby aside, and the baby died. And so they said it's toxic, right?

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,780
Literally, they coated an entire young newborn with it, and that would be an unnatural condition,

80
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,500
right? So, yeah.

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
But it was extremely effective. Yeah, I treated many a wound with that stuff when I could

82
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,260
get my hands on it. A bottle of mercurochrome was practically an essential in my first aid

83
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,800
kit when I was much younger. It was perfect. It did the job.

84
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,420
Yeah, if you knew what to do with it. Most people didn't use it properly. They put it

85
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,120
directly on the open wound, where you have to close the wound first, and put it on the

86
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,700
bandage. You never put it directly. But anyway, it's not available anymore, so there's no

87
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,900
importance to get into it. But what I'm saying is most of the stuff that people, whatever,

88
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,720
it's all done by tradition. Why? Because 85% of all prescription medicines in less than

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,700
10 years are banned. That's a statistic. If you want to say, if you want to be very

90
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,620
conservative, and strike out derivations, 70%. Every 10 years, 70% of what's prescribed

91
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,780
now that was fairly recent will be banned as harmful and dangerous, because the chemistry

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,220
has nothing to do with it. Here's an example of the chemistry and the energy. Okay, so

93
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,040
you have a chemical A, whatever, let's say it's medicinal, and then we have chemical

94
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,840
A on the side, the same thing, but they look different. One is a powder, one is a liquid.

95
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,600
You know that the liquid one, in many cases, will be more effective, right? Okay. So taking

96
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:57,440
a liquid form, and then you have chemical A again, that's injected. That's a different

97
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,300
effect. Same chemical, right? I'll give you a great example that they tampered with,

98
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,980
screwed with, and continue, and it might as well be tradition for how long they've been

99
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,920
using it, is opium, because if you work with the initial, with the paste, if you work with

100
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,920
the stuff that you actually get out of the flower, it's a whole different world from

101
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,460
this garbage that they create now. Sure. Now you can judge that by its energy, and by the

102
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,700
way, you can synthetically make something that's very close to it just by looking at

103
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,220
it, not knowing the chemical constituents. So as the plant grows up, it still continues

104
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,820
to grow up, but in energy, part of the plant does not want to go further, so what does

105
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,360
it do? It forms a bulb. Right. Right? Instead of a, like imagine wheat or corn. As it grows,

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,260
it starts to get sharper and pointier. I mean, it's like, yeah, let me go, let me go, I want

107
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,140
to go this way, right? But with opium, as it's leaving the ground and going up, right, towards

108
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,360
the young, right, what happens is part of it rounds off, like it doesn't part, but the

109
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,820
rest of it continues, right? So what do you know about energy movement, right? Well, it

110
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,680
sort of hits, yeah, it starts to swell and bulge, and it almost forces itself back toward

111
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,020
the ground because, yeah, like your car, you have an accelerator and a brake pedal, right?

112
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,240
So once you start looking at these things, it's quite interesting that you can actually,

113
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,020
it's very difficult to do it alone, but you can actually do all of this in your kitchen.

114
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,420
Why do I say kitchen? You mean transmutation, was he talking about this? Alchemy,

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,340
transmutation in your kitchen, because usually requires heating, electricity, water, right?

116
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,080
That's why I say you can, if you can't make it in your kitchen, it probably can't be made,

117
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,980
right? So that's the aspect to that. But I wanted to get into something else, though,

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,440
because I know it's quote, unquote, the pagan holidays. And I always refer to them that way

119
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,460
because what they did, by the way, is they, you know, they say there's 12 months in, you

120
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,140
know, the 12 system, right? Oh, yeah. But it's really a decimal system because they're

121
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,500
ending the year in the 10th month. And they know, and everyone knows it's the 10th month.

122
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,900
They just don't acknowledge it, right? How do we, how do I know? Desi is December,

123
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:17,020
Dessa is 10. So, you know, yeah, exactly. So they're forcing a 10, a 10 denomination,

124
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,140
a 10-deca system on everyone. And it's, they'll say it's 12 months, but it's not

125
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,780
acknowledged functionally as such because they end the year in the 10th month, right?

126
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:35,040
And they call it the 12th month, but it can't be, right? From any aspect. What people do

127
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,960
now are celebrating, which I understand. I think even the narrative that I discuss, there's

128
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,220
a spring festival, there's a midsummer festival, and there's a fall festival. And then typically,

129
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,000
there is not much highlight on the winter festival because the winter in an agricultural

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,580
society is the time where you do things that you couldn't do while you were doing agriculture.

131
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,400
The busiest time in agriculture is spring, summer, and fall. Most important, I'd say

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,040
they're all just as equally important, but the fall is when you tally everything in and

133
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,440
you reflect and see what you did for the year. So when your seventh month is over in the

134
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,160
fall, coming on the eighth month, if you have a broken wagon or you need a new roof

135
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,260
or you need to travel, now's the time to do it. You plant your winter rye, you know, the

136
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,540
slow-growing stuff that doesn't need attention, and you travel. So it's interesting how they're

137
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,320
doing. I mean, all right, Sam's a summer holiday. When is the most traveling? Thanksgiving,

138
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,180
Christmas, right? You notice?

139
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,460
A lot of people travel in the summer, though.

140
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,340
A lot of people do travel in the summer, though.

141
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,040
Yes, they do. I think more people travel in the summer, but not in a focused week or a

142
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,740
focused day.

143
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,540
Like, everyone seems to take off a week or two, and it's always the end of July, August,

144
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,960
you know, depending on how far you are from the coast, by the way, or coastal area. Like,

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,680
if you look at the European coast, right, or the American coast, right, it'll be around

146
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,140
that time. Now, in the upside-down world, you know, the other hemisphere, it's the opposite.

147
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,640
They're in the middle of summer right now.

148
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,120
Right.

149
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,200
So back to the thing that I wanted to just bring up, cooking. I think we did also on

150
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,560
the inverse of this one on 57. It was 57. We talked about meat and potatoes, and you

151
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,100
never cook meat and potatoes together, by the way. You always have to cook them separately.

152
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,020
But I've been doing something with animal lately called low and slow, and it works with

153
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,420
everything, and I just want to go over it. If you're making a roast, I think, what do

154
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:39,000
they call a joint in England? It's called a joint, a roast. What I found out is the

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,640
usual Greek-speak stuff, and maybe I'll throw some beginner stuff in here. You never want

156
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,820
to put anything into a pot or a fire or whatever if it's coming out of the fridge. You have

157
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,100
to have it minimum, at least, room temperature. What do I mean? Like, if it's in the fridge,

158
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,380
it's at 4 degrees Celsius or 39, and now you want to get it into a pot at 200, let's say

159
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,480
the boiling point of water, Q12 or something like that. That's a huge temperature difference,

160
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,560
right? So the reason why you're doing part of the preparation is to have it out of the

161
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,280
fridge and close to room temperature, so you don't have that big temperature difference,

162
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,760
because that big temperature difference will actually change the results, by the way. So

163
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,220
for people that are afraid of all this stuff, once someone will say, well, I want to make

164
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,300
sure it's cooked because of the salmonella, I'm like, what? You can't cook salmonella

165
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,640
out. If you know chicken has salmonella or is suspected, don't buy it. You should never

166
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,020
buy, actually, in many things, it's unlawful to eat a diseased animal, you know? So why

167
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,060
would you, right, a foodborne illness and all that stuff, that has nothing to, right,

168
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,320
that's factory farming and people with poor sensibilities, like white people. Oh, did

169
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,940
I just say that?

170
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,280
You did.

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,540
Anyway. Yeah, it has nothing to do with the color of your skin.

172
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,020
Yes.

173
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,220
I met plenty of black folk that act like white people, not white folk. White folk and white

174
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,860
people are two different things, by the way. So, yeah, so anyway, and by the way, anybody

175
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,500
tuning in now, I've been speaking out, not really for, but mostly against white people

176
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,680
ever since I've been doing this Greek speak. So I'm not part of this too much white agenda

177
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,840
that's been coming out lately. They're doing it for a wrong reason. I'm just saying, like,

178
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,160
you got to get some tradition. You got to get some backbone. You got to get some, let's

179
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,840
just say this for everybody covering here, some proper hygiene methods, you know, proper,

180
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,900
you know, some stuff, you know, because I actually think that putting a chemical on

181
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,280
something is hygienic, right? So, yeah, learn how to use, right. That's all. OK, well,

182
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,700
not going into a tangent, but I want to say, OK, white people are the way they are, especially

183
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,020
in America, because they're depression babies.

184
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,520
What they did is they screwed people with the depression in the 30s. No one knew why

185
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,480
it happened. By the way, the only reason the depression, Great Depression was there was

186
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,780
no stock market crash. Yeah, it was a stock market crash. But if you read the newspaper

187
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,860
articles, bankers were not jumping out of the windows. The army was brought in to protect

188
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,020
Wall Street in New York then because people were going and throwing the bankers out of

189
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,660
the windows. Go find the articles. It's not. Yeah. Yeah. So what all they did see back

190
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,540
then, 20s, 30s, whatever, when people quote unquote got their salary at the end of the

191
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,700
week, if you watch the old movies with a company office, there's a big safe in the black and

192
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,980
white. Right. You know, let's go talk to the press. It was always a big thing. They didn't

193
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,480
use checks, credit cards and stuff like that. Very few people use bank accounts. There's

194
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,660
no reason for it. So back in the 30s, if you said, I'm going to write you a check, they

195
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,060
were like they were set it back. You're like, you're going to pull some kind of scam on

196
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,980
me. Yeah, that's right. It is a scam. All checks are scammed. Right. So everything was

197
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,040
done by cash. Yeah. All the way into the 70s and 80s. Quite honestly, nobody wanted a credit

198
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,000
card or anything other than cash. People looked at you straight. Well, you know, I actually

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,820
know one of my in-law relative relative is one of the first people to be issued a credit

200
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,620
card in the late 50s. And he was part of a it was an experiment like you can't like like

201
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,480
what I'm doing with water devices or at least you can't really buy them because, you know,

202
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,400
we don't know what they're going to do, really, even though they're pretty miraculous in the

203
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,500
way that they do what they say they do. So what they did with back then, when you got

204
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,420
a credit card, you got a call every week like, where'd you go? What'd you buy? What was the

205
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,380
reaction to the questionnaires? Because there's still feeling it out. Right. So but anyway,

206
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,320
everything was cash. All the banks did was when the secretary went to the bank to pick

207
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,480
up the cash to pay the workers, they said, sorry, we're out of cash. They withheld the

208
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,200
cash. Right. So if you worked in a factory that made electric motors, the only thing

209
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,160
they could do is, quote unquote, pay you with electric motors. So all these guys got electric

210
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,120
motors and they go to the stove to get some meat, milk and bread and they bring the milk

211
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,420
and bread to the counter and the story says, here's electric motor. We're not getting

212
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,300
cash. And the store owner says, yeah, look over here. I got 50 electric motors. I don't

213
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,859
need any more. Sorry. Bye. That's all they did. There was no depression. It was all.

214
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:08,660
And by the way, I think Bernanke apologized for for the Federal Reserve orchestrating

215
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,980
the Great Depression. So from that, there were a lot of people, by the way, that knew

216
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,780
what was going on. And there was like a sort of patriot type revolt going on. And then

217
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,260
they did World War Two. Right. To flush them out. Right. So. Yeah. So. Right. Yeah. So

218
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,300
like to me, nine. The covid was to flush out the 9-11 people, by the way. You know, that

219
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,840
sentiment that still lurked on. Right. So they fell for it. You have to change the

220
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,040
venue. Right. Well, as soon as you get basically people resisting the situation, you have

221
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,380
to do something to clear them out a little bit, because otherwise you'll get too many

222
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,880
of them will get together and you'll have an actual resistance. So, yeah, I mean, that's

223
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,380
what they did. World War One, World War Two, each one. It was was another like let's flush

224
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,960
the population. The truthfully, the young men who were of that right age to be in a good

225
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,400
mood to fight. Well, you got to do something with those people, because otherwise they

226
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,020
might turn against them to do stuff like throw the bankers out the windows. Yeah. So good.

227
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. So. So would that depression era, which was like, we don't

228
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,460
really know what's going on, but we have to go along with it. The canned food stuff that

229
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:24,060
that just no more traditions as as because we might it might happen again. And what happened

230
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,320
was the people were carefree to a point of negligence. You had World War Two and then

231
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,500
the boom, the commercial boom of the 50s and all that with all the member of the slogan,

232
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,620
better living through chemistry, chemicals or whatever. And and they forgot what was

233
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,440
brought over by the Dutch, the Scottish, the Irish, the Germans that, you know, I'm talking

234
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,440
about predominantly the East Coast. Right. Right. You know, that's basically, you know,

235
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,560
if you hear certain accents down south or in like near Tennessee or whatever, they're

236
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:02,300
actually derivations of like Pennsylvania of German and Scottish. And right. So, yeah,

237
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,700
some of these accents were just certain families that branched out and kept they spoke a certain

238
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,560
way. Right. So the East Coast of the U.S. is basically your Dutch, German, Scottish,

239
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,700
Irish, you know, pockets in the north and more in the northern east coast and south

240
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:25,080
of Italian. And right. Right. And such and such. So, yeah. So and then they moved over

241
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,860
to California. Right. But they got them after the migration happened. But it affected the

242
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,780
so the whole country, in other words, impoverished traditions and the culture of the people that

243
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,580
came here. That's that's where I quote unquote say the white, you know, they're white. You

244
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,680
can't cook. Right. If you're white, you can't cook.

245
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,700
Well, the first move was the first move was, look, you can't get the good quality food

246
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,600
you want to get because you don't have cash to go get it. So now you're stuck with whatever

247
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,680
you can get your hands on, because if you want to eat nothing or something that's crap,

248
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,720
people are going to choose to eat the crap. Well, then, yeah, they raided all the they

249
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,320
raided. They got old shoes, boiled it to eat the leather. I mean, I would I think that

250
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,740
was a bad direction to go. I mean, because you could always cultivate something. It was

251
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,060
the lack of knowledge. But what I'm saying is when I say white people, it's this culture

252
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,800
that came out from the Depression and all the steps of corruption till now. And give

253
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,680
me an example. When I first met the wife, we were dating and she goes, I want to introduce

254
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,960
you to my some friends. And I say, well, are they Mexican, Greek, Spanish? No, they're

255
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,860
American. OK, so she said, meet me at six o'clock and we'll go over to their house for dinner.

256
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,000
I said that. All right. Well, I show up at 10 after six and she says, you're late. Where

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,260
have you been? And I said, well, I had dinner. She goes, why do you have dinner? We're going

258
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,460
for dinner. I say, you'll see. You'll see. So we go over there, we sit down and eat dinner.

259
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,960
And I they give me some food. I just moved it from the left of the plate to the right

260
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,060
plate. She ate a whole bunch. We leave. She goes, oh, I don't feel well. I don't feel

261
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,320
well at all. And I'm like, I told you these are white people. You don't eat their food.

262
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,400
Right. You know. So and then it happened again. And she's like, oh, my gosh. Now that makes

263
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,180
sense. When she was growing up or whatever, that whenever there was a big dinner, nobody

264
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,100
felt well, you know. And it was like, come on, you got it. This is like, you know, really,

265
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,400
really like snap your finger to it, you know. And you see. So that's a real life example.

266
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,760
And she's a witness to it. And many others are witness to it. And also I've had some

267
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,540
response, by the way, from people with Greek students. I thought my mom's cooking was good

268
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,700
or my wife's cooking was good. I heard what you talking about it. And I started doing

269
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,660
some of the things I said. Oh, yeah. What I thought was good sucks. I can't eat it now.

270
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,920
And I'm like, yeah, yeah. What changed? Nothing. I mean, you changed a little bit. It doesn't

271
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,420
take a lot to make someone realize what they're used to is crap. Right. Now, I'm not saying

272
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,780
all of the white people food is crap. But if you use that as a rule, you'll be safe.

273
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,080
You'll be very safe. And if it's not crappy, it's an anomaly. So what do I mean by that?

274
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Winter time, they're doing their holiday. So low and slow, low and slow. This is a mega

275
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,800
tangent went around the block twice, not just once. So what I've done recently is

276
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,280
some chicken. I've done some ribeye and sirloin steaks all the same way. Just remember this

277
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,840
forty five minutes to an hour per pound. What is he talking about? So let's say you have

278
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,500
a ribeye piece. It's three inches thick or so. It's about a pound and a half, two pounds

279
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,480
almost. Let's say let's call three pounds. It's a one bone ribeye porterhouse steak.

280
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,340
That's three inches thick. Same thing without the bone. You leave it out of the fridge.

281
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,360
You put it on a plate that goes inside a paper bag with salt on the paper bag and you leave

282
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,800
it there overnight. Right. There's the salt ionizes. Right. If you're in a room full of

283
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,240
salt, it smells like ozone. Right. Because the ions. Right. OK. So. So you let it dry

284
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,380
out and come up to room temp and then you put it in an oven. If you can make it work

285
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,220
this way at one hundred and twenty degrees at about an hour per pound. Now, most people,

286
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,140
when you put an oven at warm, it doesn't go below 150. Well, you're going to have to figure

287
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,440
out how to work that. Maybe leave the door slightly open, tune it down, turn it down

288
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,280
even more, you know. OK. And and you're basically at one hundred and twenty degrees. That's

289
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,480
it. You know, look in Tucson or Phoenix, if you close all the car windows in the summer,

290
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,560
it's one hundred and eighty degrees on the dash. That's too hot. Right. You know, cook

291
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,460
an egg on the sidewalk. I didn't think that was possible. I did it here once. It didn't

292
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,240
fry up like in a pan. But yeah, in three minutes, the egg was ready to flip over easy. Right.

293
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:44,760
So, OK, so really, really low. And you basically are warming the meat through. Now, the logic

294
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,540
between this and that is this, you know, like rare is less than one hundred and thirty degrees

295
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:57,660
mediums, 140 well done, 150 and up. Right. So why would you cook it at 350? Right. OK.

296
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,460
So what's going on here is you're basically warming up the meat and the fibers are instead

297
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,060
of contracting when they go into the fire and getting tough, they're they're relaxed.

298
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,880
It's like they're in a sauna and it starts to relax and relax and relax. Now, let's

299
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,360
say this three pound piece that I did last night and I've done this over and over with

300
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,720
steaks and all that, too. And chicken. Let's say this has been in through three hours.

301
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,120
It just looks basically this just slightly darker than it was when it was raw. And it's

302
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,640
at one hundred and twenty one hundred and thirty seven. I've tried also, which is fine

303
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,980
up to a hundred, but definitely not one hundred and fifty go below 150. This is not going

304
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,880
to work because it will get tough. So between one twenty and one forty. Now, if you if you're

305
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,100
one of these people that watches your food opening and closing the door, what does that

306
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,260
do? It drops the right. So you'll be fine. Right. If you. Yeah. So. So what you do is

307
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,360
when it's after the three hours for a three pound piece at one hundred and twenty degrees.

308
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,480
He told us that people are like, you're not cooking at a hundred. OK, what you do is you

309
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,780
do a very rapid broil on it. One minute to two minutes on each side. I use I have a

310
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,540
mesquite grill and I have a pizza oven. So the pizza oven goes to a thousand degrees.

311
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,620
The grill, it gets up to seven hundred. Right. So I light a fire on one side of it and I

312
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,980
bring the meat and it's like, wow, really hot. You know, one minute. Flip it around, flip

313
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,780
it around because you have six sides. If it's like a block, like a cube. Right. OK. You

314
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,400
got the top, bottom, left, right, front, back. Right. So and you just keep moving it.

315
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,980
So you got six minutes in there, one minute per side. You take it out of the fire. This

316
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,120
is all cosmetics, by the way. And you put it back where you had it for 120 degrees for

317
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,000
another half an hour. And with the flight, with the heat off and then you serve it and

318
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,800
it's for tender. You could do this with any kind of meat, by the way. Lamb, fish or whatever.

319
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,020
The fish doesn't have to be that long. Let's leave fish out of this for now. Yeah. Fish

320
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,860
definitely different. Yeah. To me. But you don't you can do it. But it would be 10 minutes

321
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,700
per pound with fish, not one hour per pound. You know, it doesn't need much. Again, the

322
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,140
worst fish you'll ever eat is something that comes out of the fridge and goes right to

323
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,280
the pan. Right. It'll never it won't even taste good. So you have to have things at

324
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,520
room temp. If you're afraid of foodborne illness or whatever, you must encase it with

325
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,240
salt. One way to encase it with salt is wrap the fish or the meat or whatever with paper

326
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,580
towel or napkins and then cover that with salt. Cover it with salt. There is no way anything's

327
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,400
going to grow on it if you're afraid. Right. OK. You know. OK. Now, also, what I do before

328
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,700
I do this, I have a big plastic mixing tub or whatever that I use in the kitchen. I put

329
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,340
baking soda, salt and water and I dunk the meat in there for a few minutes. Then I take

330
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,140
it out and dry it off. That removes anything that might be taking trying to grow on the

331
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,320
outside. Right. What about a pan? Nothing will survive. What about a pan of salt water

332
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,160
also in the oven? What do you think about that? Yeah. For for for resting. Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,360
That'll work. But you need it. You need proximity. It has to be close. You can't just be in the

334
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,040
oven. That's to be proximity. OK, so what you'll end up is having something extremely tender.

335
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,480
By the way, with poultry, I don't know. By the way, you know what inspired me the most to

336
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,180
cook is when I found when Scribd came out, Scribd, S-C-R-I-B-D. It was really you didn't

337
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,380
have to sign up. Anyway, I found some someone had scanned some cookbooks in there from the

338
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,400
15, 16 and 17 hundreds and there was no name on. There was a name to cook, but the file

339
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,160
did not have a name. So it was file six, four, nine, seven, four, three, two, one, nine, seven,

340
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,300
one, you know, that kind of thing, because I had it bookmarked. I remember years ago, a computer

341
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,320
that died out. So I'm reading and studying cookbooks. And basically, you know how expensive

342
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,800
books were 500 years ago. So very expensive. You know, a book could be ten thousand dollars

343
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,220
in today's money back then. Right. So obviously, if you wrote cooking instructions

344
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,320
and recipes on a book, these people were very, very wealthy. Right. And now they wanted to

345
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,580
keep it in case they had to replace someone and, you know, in the kitchen. And they took

346
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,660
the time. You got to realize, guys, when you look at and gals, if you read a book or find

347
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,740
something that Scribd that's more than or printed two or three hundred years ago, even if it's

348
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,060
scanned, that book costs about the two of those books. You could buy a new car. That's how

349
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,800
valuable they were back then. Right. Right. So I knew right away that this was done by

350
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,760
someone who was serious, serious business about food. Right. And I realized certain

351
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,500
techniques. A lot of it was, you know, there was something of the master roaster was about.

352
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,780
This was this chapter was to the master roaster. Right. This one was to the

353
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,320
sautee. And this chapter was for the baker. So it was interesting. You know, like, what's

354
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,260
your job? I'm a master roaster. I never heard. I mean, they call people chefs now, but they

355
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,080
don't call them master roasters anymore. Right. That's your job to roast. So I was fascinated

356
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,720
by it. And I just I can't recall any anything poignant that I could bring out and

357
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,560
say this. This is what I got from that directly. But the whole perspective

358
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,340
that I brought forward today and on other Greek speaks is what I got from there

359
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,660
specifically, because you want the perspective that I gave you. Now, if you go to a nutritionist

360
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,240
or cook hundred and twenty degrees for three hours for three pounds and then no, no, you have

361
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,900
to bring it up to temporary. It has to be at least three hundred. Right. No one is going to do that.

362
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,500
There there is a there is more of a low and slow trend that's been happening

363
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,780
again. People are coming to their senses. This is purely for pleasure, you know, for

364
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,980
pleasure, meaning eating food that is distinctively delicious and pleasurable to eat.

365
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,360
Now, one thing that I did get out of the the ancient books, let's say 300 years

366
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,680
is ancient, by the way, for a cookbook, is that the poultry must be dried properly.

367
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,380
So whenever you're dealing with poultry, most likely the audience will

368
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,360
be dealing with chicken or turkey and duck. It's almost traditional that you

369
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,300
should dry it out because of the heavy fat content. What what you do is you must hang the bird somewhere

370
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,040
or put it on a rack where it dries. I mean, literally where you touch the skin

371
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,040
and it feels like dry skin. Right. You know, dry skin, like dry, like, you know,

372
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,200
somebody says you got to put some lotion on your elbows. Right. That kind of that kind of dry almost.

373
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah. Yeah. You got to get some lotion on those elbows, man. Right. Or your kneecaps. Right.

374
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,420
That that's dry. Right. You won't get that chalkiness because of the fat coming through. But really dry.

375
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,420
Yeah. If you stuck a piece of paper to it, it will be just like sticking it to another piece of paper.

376
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,780
Once you get it to that point, what happens is the fats in the bird start to dissolve.

377
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,920
And what the fats that are layered within the muscle fibers, when they dissolve, they become

378
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,380
I wouldn't say acidic, but they release an enzyme that does what to the meat?

379
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,420
Tenderizes it. Yeah. Yeah. Inside out. And then you can do a fast cook.

380
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,220
So instead of cooking the chicken to death, you can just cook it for, I don't know,

381
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,640
a three pound chicken for 40, 15 minutes per pound at high heat or do the low and slow.

382
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:19,140
I dry the part of the poultry out so much that I just goes right away into high heat, browns right away.

383
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:25,280
So after like 10 minutes, it looks like it's done. But then you lower the heat and do the slow part there.

384
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,940
The reason I do that with poultry, because it's so willing to give up all of its juices.

385
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,260
When I do a chicken on a 600 to 800 degree grill, there is not one drop of fat.

386
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,100
You ever see like barbecue chicken, the fats burning everywhere.

387
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,780
I said I said or anything, if you're cooking any meat on a fire and it's dripping at all,

388
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,300
you might have one or two is OK drips. And I mean, not not three or four drips.

389
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,620
If it's pouring liquid out, guess what? It's pouring out all the flavor, all texture,

390
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,040
all the tenderness is coming out of the meat.

391
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,580
So I've been to barbecues and places where they invite me to eat.

392
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,240
And I see the person by the grill and all you hear is sizzle, sizzle, sizzle.

393
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,580
Five like you want. Would you like some barbecue? I'm like, I would, but not that one.

394
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,460
No, thanks. Because, you know, and I ask people, how was the chicken your wife just ate?

395
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,220
Oh, I was like eating sawdust. Right. That's because they lost all the moisture in the beginning.

396
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,580
Right. When I do it. Ha ha ha. Greek is bragging about his poultry skills.

397
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,240
Yes, I am. There is not one drop of fat or oil in the grill, no matter how hot it is,

398
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,480
because it starts off very dry. Again, if the meat is moist,

399
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,620
you're cooking to sear or to brown or caramelize.

400
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,580
It has to be way above the boiling point of water,

401
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,780
but nothing will get to that point unless all the water is gone.

402
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,860
So if you have wet meat in the fire, even if it's a frying pan,

403
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,220
it's going to be at 210, whatever degrees, 212,

404
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,700
for as long as it takes for all that moisture to boil off while it's still cooking the meat,

405
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,180
which is not a low temperature. It's rather high.

406
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,620
Low has to be below 150 or really, really high.

407
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,020
Now, if you put that meat in front of a thousand degrees,

408
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,200
it still will not go above 200 degrees until what all the water is gone.

409
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,520
So why don't you do yourself a favor and dry your meat off? Right.

410
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,840
So or the best way to do it is through time and convection.

411
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,300
Another thing that I do, Wal-Mart sells these little battery operated,

412
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,200
rechargeable fans or 10 bucks, 12 bucks.

413
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,860
You plug in USB and they run for like eight hours on low. It's fantastic.

414
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,880
There are four inch fans. We call those muffin fans or whatever.

415
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,640
You just put one of those fans in the oven or whatever or a box with the poultry

416
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
and you let it blow and blow and blow overnight.

417
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,340
And that will get it nice and dry. Also, again, with your salt.

418
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,440
Again, with the poultry, what I do is I Babscotch it,

419
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,600
which is I cut the spine right down the middle.

420
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,520
Now, it's easier to cut the left and right of the spine if your knives aren't sharp

421
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,820
or if you're using a scissor, if you're not good with knives.

422
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,680
I recommend getting a heavy duty kitchen scissor or the kind of scissors the paramedics use.

423
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,940
If you've seen those, they're designed to cut through leather and zippers and buttons.

424
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,840
They're very strong. Those are good.

425
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,400
If you've heard of them, yeah, they're easy to get.

426
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,820
Everyone should have one of those, by the way, because it'll cut through pretty much anything.

427
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,420
Right. And cut the spine out.

428
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,440
And when you open the bird or the duck or whatever turkey,

429
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,480
just up from the tail, about inches to up from the tail, left and right is where the kidney sacs are.

430
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,480
And you don't see them when you're cleaning out the bird because they're underneath the membrane.

431
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,940
And if you cook them in there, you're going to get that gamey liver flavor in your meat,

432
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,600
which is not that great. Right. Right.

433
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,300
Because if you're cooking organ meat, it needs to be cooked very differently than muscle meat.

434
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,300
Yes. So what you want to do is feel around where the spine left and right,

435
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,120
about an inch or two above, two inches above the tail there.

436
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,699
And you'll find a soft spot. Poke your finger in there and push.

437
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,200
And guess what? The kidneys will pop out.

438
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,980
And if you have a cat or a dog, it's a delicacy. Right.

439
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,900
And clean that carcass out really, really, really, really well.

440
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,680
There is, you know, and of course, you always want to get the best quality.

441
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,440
And I wanted to bring this up because it's become the low and slow method I've been using for a little while now.

442
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,100
It's become very important to me because the difference between doing the low and slow,

443
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,680
which is low temperature, long time, and then just a rapid high heat for color and flavor.

444
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,940
The difference between doing that and not is huge.

445
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,840
There's no comparison. You will not want to go back.

446
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,500
I mean, the right. I mean, it's not subtle.

447
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,800
It's not like you want it boiled, fried or grilled. No, no, no.

448
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,420
There's nothing to do with the style of cook. It has to do with what it does to the animal.

449
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,700
Right. By the way, if you go to a hardcore Chinese restaurant where everything's in Chinese

450
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,360
and you don't speak Chinese or read Chinese, they give you the English version.

451
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,420
When you're looking at beef category, it'll say muscle, muscle, muscle, kidney, liver, tripe.

452
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,100
Right. Because when you eat a steak or most things you're eating, what the muscle muscle.

453
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Right. We don't call it muscle. We just call it steak or beef or chuck or whatever.

454
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,380
Right. So we just call it by the cut. We don't call it for what it is.

455
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,420
So organ meat is another thing that can be discussed.

456
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,960
By the way, when they fed animals that are supposedly carnivorous, just muscle meat, they got sick.

457
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,960
They need organ meat. Right. Tigers, lions, bears, let's say they go for the organs.

458
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,060
That's where. Right. That's where all the energy is. Again, it's about energy.

459
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,540
If you feed a lion or a tiger just muscle, they die of a certain toxicity.

460
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,300
If you want to meet, they always eat through the muscle and go for the organs.

461
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,860
Well, yeah. Well, the stomach area. Yeah. And then they save that.

462
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,320
In other words, when they're full on the organ meat, then the other stuff is put aside.

463
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Right. Or it's left for scavengers, by the way.

464
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,140
Well, that's the other thing to do for it. Right. When you see the you know, the hyenas or the carcass.

465
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,860
Yeah. The other things that feed off of the carcass, the birds that come along and all that.

466
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,380
Yeah. And they're more they're more, let's say, set up to eat the muscle meat.

467
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,080
So I just wanted to bring that up because, again, I've done about five or six of these now in the past couple of months.

468
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,340
And it's there's no discussion. And I wanted to make that an addendum.

469
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,940
If you're doing, quote unquote, holiday cooking.

470
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,900
And I think the last time when we spoke about what do we do with these pagan holidays?

471
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,640
I was like, you can enjoy the benefits of it without the pitfalls. Right.

472
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,320
That's right.
