1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,720
Okay, I'm gonna give the Greek a call.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,620
It looks normal, right?

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,680
Yeah, it does.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,100
Not even a coloration difference or anything.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,400
Alright, so I was looking at 67, and 67, what it was, is stress in the atmosphere.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,020
Now, I started talking to you about the general condition of people, and the mentality that

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,340
I was noting among people.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,320
And then you started talking about stress in the atmosphere.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,479
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,020
Okay, that's why teenagers stay up late, because the air is clear.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,320
There you go, right.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,840
And then we got into that whole thing about why it is that people stay up late, because

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,020
that's when other people are sleeping, and therefore, there isn't that in the ether.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,180
So, and that's the way that one went.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,240
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,660
Okay?

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,680
Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,420
Alright.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm just reminding you, because it's 76, so I went to 67.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,440
So, next one we do, let's see, 77.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,720
87.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,460
77, you know, 77, well, 77 is a 77, right?

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,520
Palindromes are stops, but when you subtract the palindrome of a palindrome, it goes right

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,060
to zero.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:06,660
Right.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,500
2178 is the only number that doesn't collapse.

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,880
Any other number, you subtract its palindrome, so, you know, 1 through 11, 0 through 11 doesn't

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,500
work, right?

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,020
Right.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,800
Because if you subtract 9, it doesn't have a palindrome, 9 from 9, it goes to zero.

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,340
Right.

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:21,860
Right?

33
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,160
Any number, you leave the integers out if it's negative, and you keep doing the palindrome,

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,600
they go usually to 9, and then 6, like Tesla was saying, 3, and then 0.

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,040
All numbers within two or three operations, when you subtract their palindrome, it doesn't

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,640
matter if it's 49,999, right?

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,060
Right.

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,220
It will go down to zero after just a couple of operations, and from its palindrome.

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,900
But palindromes disappear right away, not double numbers.

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,580
Great.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,700
So, what's the palindrome of 77?

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,480
77 minus 77, boom, that goes right to zero.

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
So, we live in a synthetic environment.

44
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,560
The only one that doesn't do it is 2178.

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,340
It becomes 8,000, whatever, and you subtract it, and it becomes something, and then it

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,960
becomes a little bit bigger, twice, I think, 2178, and then you subtract the backwards

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,000
of that, and it goes back to 2178.

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,140
And then you do the palindrome of that, and you're back to where you started, where it

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,160
brings you right back to 2178.

50
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,860
It just loops around.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,220
It's the only number that does it.

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,080
That's the fine constant.

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,680
137.84 or whatever also is the fine number constant they use in physics, right?

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Pi times 5.

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,080
All right.

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,260
Okay, let's get into it.

57
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,520
Let's just start making a short one.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,460
Yeah, no, absolutely.

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,040
I just wanted to let you know where we were at.

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,320
All right.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,460
Let's start.

62
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,140
Sonic event 76.

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,300
Okay.

64
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,960
I almost tripped over that.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
It was funny because I had a bunch of other numbers just floating in my head due to the

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,740
fact that we were having a little conversation before I started recording, and I was going

67
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,360
back over some things and trying to follow the Greek.

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,300
He's very, very quick, obviously, with the numbers.

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,700
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,960
How are you doing tonight?

71
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,440
Quick with the numbers, yeah.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,900
That would have been good back home, so to speak, in Jersey.

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Remember the guys running numbers?

74
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,060
Handle the books.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,920
You can make book, right, as opposed to handling the books.

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,260
Right, right.

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,240
Anyway.

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,680
We were talking about, well, sort of, let me just get into it because I had a little

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,900
chat, a text chat with someone recently on what they call Christmas Eve, like what to

80
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,180
do and this and that, the energy.

81
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,800
I said, listen, take advantage of it because, you know, we got into why teenagers stay up

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:44,940
late.

83
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,340
Well, not why, but I would suggest that the reason teenagers like to stay up late, to

84
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,720
recap, is they've gone from a young body to an adolescent body, and they're developing

85
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,980
a larger body looking more like an adult.

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,880
So as the body size changes, just like any ham radio antenna person will tell you, change

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,340
the antenna size, change the frequency, receptability.

88
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,060
So as they get more into the adult frame, the mindset can pick up more of the adult

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,600
mindset during the day, all the radio waves that the brains are transmitting and receiving.

90
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,800
And guess what?

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,540
In the collective, in normal society, it's really fucked up.

92
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,940
But this is new to them because they've just, you know, formed this more mature body.

93
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,180
Well, they didn't have the antenna before, so they weren't able to pick up as much.

94
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,140
I mean, it's that simple.

95
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,860
Well, yeah, it's when they just got introduced to it.

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,200
Right.

97
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,620
That makes perfect sense.

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,640
I mean, I can think back to when I, I mean, I don't know about you, but I virtually did

99
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,800
not need sleep as a teenager or as in my 20s.

100
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,200
I mean, I did my best stuff basically when everybody else was sleeping.

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,040
Right.

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,400
It's, this is an interesting, and I'm really sticking with this description or this reason

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,640
because once you understand, you know, the brain receives and broadcasts, right?

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,880
It's spiritual stuff, meaning mind technology, mind science, mind tech.

105
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,740
Well, I'll tell you something else, too, is you'll note a difference.

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Okay.

107
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,420
Now, where you live now, it's not, I don't think the population density is super high.

108
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,760
It's not like the Northeast.

109
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,000
But when you're in a place like New York City, right, you know, they always say the city

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,620
never sleeps.

111
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,800
It really doesn't.

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,760
There's people on the street, no matter what time you're out, no matter where you go, you'll

113
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,580
find people actively moving around in New York.

114
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,540
Now, other places, your city totally sleeps.

115
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,660
It stops, you know.

116
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,100
There's no nightlife.

117
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,500
If you, I went down, someone wanted me, I dated a girl and her dad worked one of these

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,480
jobs with all the bennies, they call them benefits.

119
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,760
When someone says you got to do it for the bennies, that's like a total slave, right?

120
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,400
Get a job with lots of good benefits, right?

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,200
And I was like, all right, I'll check this guy out.

122
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,760
He worked in maintenance.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,120
You know, when they hit the brakes too hard, especially when it's raining, you get a flat

124
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,160
spot on the wheel, on the train wheel, right?

125
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,680
The subway.

126
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,180
Sure.

127
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,840
So they have to machine those to a certain degree and then balance out their height and

128
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,220
all that.

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,020
So that's what he did.

130
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
And he was getting like 50 bucks an hour.

131
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,540
This is the 1980s, you know, which now would be equivalent to 150, 200 an hour.

132
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:13,860
Yeah.

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,060
It'd be really good pay, actually.

134
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,440
But yeah.

135
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,120
Yeah.

136
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,040
And he said, I don't think they're making that much because the salary is actually going

137
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,600
down, right?

138
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,540
So comparatively speaking, it did.

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,040
So probably they're making 100 bucks an hour, but really they should be making 200.

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,360
Yeah.

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,620
Yeah.

142
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:26,720
Gotcha.

143
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,620
Yeah.

144
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,980
In other words, at 50 bucks an hour in the 80s, you could buy a Cadillac, right?

145
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,180
No problem.

146
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
You can buy a house in a year.

147
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,080
Pay off the house in a year.

148
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah.

149
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,460
Right.

150
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,400
So anyway, I went down there, checked it out.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,240
It was busy.

152
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,580
It was really busy.

153
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,720
It was fun.

154
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,500
You know, it was like these big toys, you know, cranes lifting all these things.

155
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,160
You can't move anything on your own, right?

156
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,940
Everything's so heavy.

157
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,440
Right.

158
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,960
So there's machines everywhere.

159
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,200
And it's crowded.

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
You know, we're talking like three in the morning, right?

161
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,340
Well, and your work is important because, look, you're balancing thousands and thousands

162
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,800
of pounds on these little wheels.

163
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,280
Okay.

164
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,980
So you don't do that correctly.

165
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,780
You know, you got problems.

166
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,140
Well, it's not even that scope.

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
In other words, the city never sleeps.

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,200
I mean, I went in there.

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,860
It was like another city within the city functioning, right?

170
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah.

171
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,280
Yeah.

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,520
Of course.

173
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,000
24-7 they do this.

174
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,720
And then all the other stuff.

175
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,460
There's the nightlife, they call it.

176
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,500
And when I say nightlife, literally nightlife.

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,620
So, I mean, there are places that open at 2 a.m. or 10, actually 10 a.m., 10 p.m.

178
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:24,820
Yeah.

179
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,000
And then they carry over.

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
All the way to dawn.

181
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:27,780
Yeah.

182
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,660
The bars were normally open until 4, but it's still dark out.

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,000
And then what could you do if you walked out of a place at 4 is usually somebody knew where

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,200
an after-hours place was, and those would go on until well into the daylight hours for

185
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,480
sure.

186
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:40,940
Yep.

187
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,300
And you could go back around to the legitimate establishments reopening, really.

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,220
If you wanted to drink 24 hours a day in a bar in New York, you can do it.

189
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,280
At least quite a few bars, yeah.

190
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,120
Everybody knew a place you could go.

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,240
But that's not the reason why.

192
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,620
The thing is the quality of the thinking, again.

193
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,300
The teenager analogy that we've given many times is the quality of thinking.

194
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,680
It's messed up, the collective.

195
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,120
So, okay, going back to the text that I was doing with someone, it's like, you know, he's

196
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,760
kind of perturbed.

197
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,620
Everyone around him is doing that holiday thing, and I'm saying, listen, take advantage

198
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,420
of it because it's really quiet right now.

199
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,060
In other words, they're all in this mindset, mostly.

200
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,980
Some people are very depressed or very sad during that time, right?

201
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,660
You know, I take advantage of that, by the way, by going to the secondhand stores by

202
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,400
the Golden Ghetto.

203
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,460
The Golden Ghetto is like the edge of the rich neighborhood.

204
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,560
There's a secondhand store.

205
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,840
And I buy brand new Nordstrom shirts, which are $80, $90 shirts for five bucks.

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,559
They still have the tags on them.

207
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:37,900
Why?

208
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,020
Because these old people, they get these $30,000 a month pensions.

209
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,680
They retire to the big house in Tucson.

210
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,400
They got nobody.

211
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,080
So what they do is they walk in the malls.

212
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,260
You know, they even open up the malls in the summer real early so the old people can walk.

213
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:51,980
Right.

214
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,020
Yeah.

215
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,420
And they do the same.

216
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,440
He goes to the mall every day, whether it's, you know, whatever, BMW or Rolls Royce or Cadillac.

217
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,200
And he goes in shops.

218
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,260
He doesn't wear anything.

219
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,500
He's got a walk-in closet full of, you know, expensive shirts and suits and all that.

220
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,800
So he passes away around Christmas.

221
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,880
They usually die between Thanksgiving and New Year's.

222
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,120
And the family comes from back east, New York, Chicago, Jersey, Massachusetts.

223
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,720
And they look at this big house, $2 million house, and it's full of stuff.

224
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,580
They don't.

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,100
Selling the stuff and all that.

226
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,020
It's like, ah, we want to sell the house and get them break, you know, separate the money.

227
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,680
So all the stuff in the house gets pulled out and sent to a secondhand store.

228
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,360
Like a half a million dollar wardrobe gets sent down to the secondhand stores, getting

229
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,260
a lot of these, you know.

230
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,160
So they want to sell them.

231
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,320
Right.

232
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,940
So they mark them.

233
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,480
But I used to joke around with the wife.

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,680
I had a bag.

235
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,500
I spent 20 bucks and I had like three, four shirts and a couple other things.

236
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,760
And I pulled a shirt out of the bag, Nordstrom's, Calvin Klein, all the stuff.

237
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,760
And I go, I think this is this is a little worn out.

238
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,440
And the tags are hanging.

239
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,300
And she looks at me.

240
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,920
What do you mean?

241
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,840
It's never been worn.

242
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,500
You know, you know, it's kind of being, you know, funny, you know.

243
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,360
So this is the time for me to go do my shopping because these old parts die around this time

244
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,920
between Thanksgiving and January is when I go to this particular secondhand store.

245
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,180
It's called Speedway Outlet.

246
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, and what is is, you know, what's funny is that I guarantee you there's a couple of

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,800
people that are in business around that area that are just doing liquidator work where

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,640
picking up this big business this time of year.

249
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,000
Right.

250
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,600
And that's all you do is you go in and look, you got three, four kids, whatever.

251
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,720
They want to divide up the money.

252
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,480
Like you said, they don't want to bother with this.

253
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,920
They're not going to the secondhand store.

254
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,800
They don't know where it is.

255
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,280
But you do.

256
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,720
Oh, yeah.

257
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,560
Well, I'm not going to liquidate his closet and his furniture and his piano.

258
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,980
You go to Craigslist and they have a grand, not a baby grand or a grand piano free.

259
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,160
You know, it's a thirty thousand dollar piano.

260
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
Just come take it out of here.

261
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:46,820
Right.

262
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,160
Right.

263
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,640
And I'm like, what the hell?

264
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Is this a scam?

265
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,420
No, it's not a scam.

266
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,180
No.

267
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,280
But the thing is, somebody was paid to get rid of it.

268
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,300
And now they're just looking for somebody else to do the work so they don't have to

269
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,800
go get a truck.

270
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,420
You'll go get the truck to go get rid of it.

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah.

272
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,440
And also the Tucson is a retirement city.

273
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,900
It's a retired like Palm Springs, Tucson, Phoenix.

274
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,280
Right. Those places are known to be retirement cities.

275
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, of course.

276
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,320
So this is what's going on here right now.

277
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,240
And it's because, OK, it's not because they're having happy thoughts.

278
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,140
Some people are actually kicking the bucket.

279
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,460
Right. Right.

280
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,040
And so this is the time of year to go to retirement cities and buy secondhand stuff

281
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,620
because you'll be surprised what you'll get for secondhand.

282
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,440
You know, it's you know, and they upkeep it.

283
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,000
You know, when I saw a couple of grand pianos already and I'm like, oh, my gosh,

284
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
that's a 50,000, you know, a piano moving is very expensive.

285
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,720
They don't just don't move a piano.

286
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,940
They have to disassemble it.

287
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,920
Right. Yeah.

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,900
Usually. Yeah.

289
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah. And it has to be, you know, you don't want to damage it and all that.

290
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,260
So it's very expensive. So anyway, I'm looking at all this stuff and it's well

291
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,120
maintained. It's just because they're giving the stuff away doesn't mean it's

292
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,680
junk. It's actually because they're liquidating some wealthy retirees.

293
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,160
Estate. Right. Right.

294
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,620
This is what's going on. And this is a time of year.

295
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,780
OK, so that aspect.

296
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,540
But the other aspect is most people are typically happy.

297
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,940
So what's going on there?

298
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,240
I told this person in the text, take advantage of this.

299
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,500
All right. What does that mean?

300
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,620
The airwaves are cleaner than they usually are.

301
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,040
So take advantage of it.

302
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,560
Like if you have something you want to rehash, like a previous problem

303
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,180
or like a solution to something or you're trying to invent something

304
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
or you're trying to create something, if you're a writer or anything.

305
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,780
Now is the time to be creative because the coast is clear.

306
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,700
The air is clear or clearer than normal.

307
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,860
Right. You see, because they're receiving gifts.

308
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,680
They're happy. They're going to travel.

309
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,720
Right. You know, blah, blah, blah.

310
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,600
OK, so now the airwaves are a different frequency.

311
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,620
Take advantage of it.

312
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,700
Don't sit around and mope around and say, oh, fuck,

313
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,080
I don't do these pagan holidays and they do them.

314
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,160
What am I supposed to do?

315
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,900
Do what do whatever would work best with this cleaner air quality,

316
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,480
meaning radio frequency air.

317
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,260
You see what I mean?

318
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,600
If that makes any sense.

319
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,140
Take advantage of the circumstance.

320
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,380
You don't have to participate.

321
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,100
You can just take advantage of the circumstance,

322
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,620
which is funny because I actually got, you know, I hadn't gotten emails

323
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,060
for a little bit, which, by the way, the only time I'll see an email

324
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,740
is if you send it to me at my website, because that's the only place

325
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
where I control the emails.

326
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,640
Otherwise, we've given you the Greeks email address before.

327
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,080
And obviously people can email the Patriot.

328
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah, let's do them again.

329
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,600
Uncommon sense.

330
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,240
Radio one at Gmail dot com.

331
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,800
One is numeric one.

332
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,980
Uncommon sense.

333
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,000
Radio one at Gmail for the Greek.

334
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,060
And Chuck is blind JFK researcher at Gmail dot com.

335
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,080
And if you if you can't remember that, you can go to my website,

336
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,780
click on the little email icon and I'll get it from there.

337
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,440
But either way, it's fine.

338
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,120
But I did get one.

339
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,360
And it's funny, it kind of dovetails exactly with what you were talking about,

340
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,200
because they had asked about these pagan holidays and also about the cooking.

341
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,560
What do you do in the case that you have a partner already?

342
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
OK, now say that again.

343
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,620
A partner with a partner where you've already got a wife, a spouse, whatever.

344
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,040
I won't even give a gender on this.

345
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,620
It doesn't matter.

346
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,740
You got a wife, you got a husband.

347
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't care. OK.

348
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,460
You got a partner. OK.

349
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,800
So that's your partner in life.

350
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,480
You live together. You work together.

351
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,780
But now you're changing.

352
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,420
This is the question from the email person. OK.

353
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm rephrasing it a little bit, but it was like a very long winded sort of thing.

354
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,940
But yeah. And these holidays come up.

355
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,660
You're changing stuff.

356
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,540
And now you're noticing that originally the two of you did have an agreement.

357
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,860
The covenant you talked about earlier about relationships,

358
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
how you have the same covenant, et cetera.

359
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,060
But now, because you're learning and you're changing.

360
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,780
What do you do?

361
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,680
Because you still kind of want to maintain that partner,

362
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,140
but they might not want to come along with you, even from the kitchen.

363
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,580
Well, hang on from the kitchen to the pagan holidays.

364
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,720
They might still be stuck in the other stuff.

365
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,540
What do you do with that?

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,020
You know? Yeah, I got it.

367
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,360
It's very, very short.

368
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Way back in the day before Ocelli in the Greek and at Ocelli in the Greek,

369
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,860
I said this will break up your relationship if you start looking to live a better life.

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
Ninety eight.

371
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,980
Ninety five.

372
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,000
Ninety nine percent of the time it will break up the relationship.

373
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,020
Maybe not right away, but definitely within six months to two years.

374
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,760
Right. If you're going to live well now, that is the actual spirit.

375
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,340
We're having like a spiritual mind experiment here.

376
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,640
Let's go back.

377
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,980
This material world and your physical body belongs to the earth.

378
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,520
In other words, when you're conceived sperm and egg,

379
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,980
if the mom doesn't eat earth material food, right?

380
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,540
Vegetable, animal, earth material, whatever.

381
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,840
She won't grow the baby and you won't be born.

382
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,980
And when you're born, regardless, you know, let's say after you're weaned away,

383
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,160
if your breast milk, hopefully you do have it.

384
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,680
You still need earth material to live.

385
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,120
Food, clothing, shelter.

386
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,460
This is everything that you see and touch with most of your senses.

387
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,980
Actually, all of your senses is earth belongs to the planet, the earth,

388
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,020
this existence, whether it's flat or round or whatever.

389
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,500
So the other stuff, the personality, the behavior,

390
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,980
the intellect or lack of is your experiment here.

391
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,940
Right. Your experience here.

392
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,680
But so let's go back to the question.

393
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,180
When you have these holidays,

394
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,580
they're very much expressed through materialism.

395
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,040
Yes. Right. Yes. And and OK, now let's go back to the other side.

396
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
They're expressed materialism.

397
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,740
But what is expressed mentally, spiritually,

398
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,220
you know, intellectually, that pretty much nothing.

399
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,620
Because even if you watch a documentary on the holidays,

400
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,820
they open up just like with dinosaurs, everybody's, you know,

401
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,980
66 million years ago when they start Christmas documentaries where they say,

402
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,100
well, he wasn't really born on December 25th.

403
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,600
They always start the documentary that way. Right. Always. Right.

404
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah. You know, but see, this this this adds a weird question to the mix

405
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,140
that the email person didn't ask. OK, but I'm going to ask it.

406
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,760
And it's it's pretty weird because, look,

407
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,319
if OK, you're doing things differently

408
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,099
and you have this partner, maybe you want to keep that partner.

409
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,240
Isn't there a way to kind of participate?

410
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,339
Yeah. Then let me let me continue. OK. Yeah.

411
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,500
Let me continue, because OK, so the mental thing, right away,

412
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,480
you see all the signs.

413
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,420
And if you do a little more mental work, all is everything.

414
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,500
It's acknowledged that this is not really accurate.

415
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,540
They go further and acknowledge that it's actually sat on the schedule

416
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,360
and on the days of the traditional Saturnalia,

417
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,480
Mithra, Mithraism, Simiramis, all this other stuff that goes back.

418
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,680
OK, so that's the mental.

419
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
The the rather mental is what?

420
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,780
Singing songs, getting drunk, giving gifts, feeling good, endorphin, dopamine.

421
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,940
Right. So there's no mental aspect to it. Right.

422
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,380
Really? I mean, with any kind of depth or substance.

423
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,200
So if that's so, in other words, OK, OK, how do we make this?

424
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,920
Let's not spend too much time on this.

425
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,040
And let me get to the point.

426
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,240
It's like not you, but, you know, to myself here

427
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,540
in the third party, get to the point, Greek.

428
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,080
Just like I said, I wasn't you notice I didn't coach or pad

429
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,360
the part about relationships, 95, 98, 99 percent of the time.

430
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,420
That's not going to last. Right.

431
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,740
Notice I didn't give any other.

432
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,160
I didn't make that too soft.

433
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,020
I didn't. There's no soft landing on that. Right.

434
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,720
No, there's not much margin for. OK. Yeah.

435
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,180
Different. All right.

436
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,420
So let's let's do the same with the mental part.

437
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,160
OK, this is real stupid shit.

438
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,240
So how well the answer then is, how do you handle it?

439
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,280
If one does and one doesn't in the relationship?

440
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,920
The question I would ask myself or ask that person,

441
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,020
how well do you deal with, quote unquote, stupid shit?

442
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,400
How well do you deal with stupid shit?

443
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,800
Let's let's say the time I would say, you know, personally,

444
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,060
no matter what level it's on, most stupid shit, I just stay out of it

445
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,520
and let them do what they're going to do.

446
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,380
You know, that's probably what they're trying to do.

447
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,320
They're probably trying to do that. Right.

448
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,060
There's other stupid shit people could do.

449
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,260
What if one spouse,

450
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,520
let's say, forgets the baby at the grocery store?

451
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,260
Where's the baby? I don't know.

452
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,960
Last time I saw him at the grocery store. Oh, shit.

453
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,860
I thought I left the baby.

454
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,880
I think the baby's at the grocery store.

455
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,960
This might sound funny, but it's happening.

456
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,460
It does happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,620
OK. Or or, you know, I got why is the back of the car

458
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,540
on the driver's side rear fender all crushed in?

459
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,840
You know, like, you know, while we were at the grocery store,

460
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,360
somebody backed up in the car, took off and the person got in,

461
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,800
didn't see it, got home and then you saw it when you got home. Right.

462
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
Yep. Stupid shit. Right.

463
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,100
That's why whenever you get to your car, do a little walk around.

464
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,260
Right. The whole thing.

465
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,300
Well, that would be smart.

466
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
But look, a lot of people don't.

467
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,280
And this is going to happen at some point.

468
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,160
Stupid shit is going to happen no matter what you do.

469
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,740
If we're going to make a list of if we're going to make a list of stupid shit,

470
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,500
there's enough there's not enough time on the whole Internet.

471
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,420
Right. Cover it. Forget about Sonics. Exactly. OK.

472
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,260
Yeah. So how do you deal with stupid shit?

473
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,200
There's no soft way.

474
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,840
Look, if you're going to land, if someone if you're taking someone out

475
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,200
on an excursion and you know that they're bumps and they could land hard,

476
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,200
you tell them that before they get get into it. Right. Let them know.

477
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,160
Of course. Right. Yeah. It's only fair to warn them. Yeah.

478
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah. So I think we've done that.

479
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,020
And look, I'm not taking responsibility.

480
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,400
Look, I can take responsibility with you and you can take sort of responsibility.

481
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,780
You know, I know I've gotten at least

482
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,060
500 people in the past, let's say, decade told me that they

483
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,260
drifting away from the standard collective stuff. Right.

484
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,040
So is it because of me?

485
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,860
Yeah, they actually told me it was because of me.

486
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,700
So am I responsible for it?

487
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,260
No, because I didn't do I just told them they they're the ones that do it. Right.

488
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,960
If I told them to go get a gun and shoot themselves, would they do it?

489
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,980
Right. It's my fault. Right.

490
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,860
Well, we've spoken to thousands of people and 500 of them actually drifted away.

491
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,020
I mean, that's pretty good.

492
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,920
And it is, you know, the thousands of people that didn't.

493
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,540
Are we responsible for them as well? No, we're not.

494
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,240
You know, but I know.

495
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,660
But there's a certain amount of responsibility,

496
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,840
because when a question like this is brought up,

497
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,500
you don't want to duck and run away and, you know, you want to cover it. Right.

498
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,240
So and there's no it's a hard landing.

499
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,500
So, yeah, so it's going to break up.

500
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,140
Ninety five, ninety eight, ninety nine percent of the time.

501
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,000
The reason I broke it up to ninety five, ninety eight,

502
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,520
ninety nine percent of time to separate, because as you do more research,

503
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,100
the chances of breaking up is that the ninety nine percent,

504
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,380
if you don't do a lot of research, but it makes you you don't want to.

505
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,780
It'll be ninety five percent. So. Right.

506
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,940
OK, so there's no that's not a that's a hard landing.

507
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,820
And the other hard landing is how do you deal with stupid shit?

508
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,180
So it's stupid shit.

509
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,720
You're going to have to deal with very simple.

510
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
Well, there you go.

511
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,520
And, you know, the same thing goes for toxic shit as well.

512
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,380
And I'm going to tell you what I mean by that is that, you know,

513
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,760
there are people that get together and in their relationship,

514
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,660
something new gets introduced and it's destructive.

515
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,840
And sometimes they share it.

516
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,680
No problem.

517
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,320
They're both perfectly, you know, perfectly capable of being self destructive

518
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,120
and therefore being mutually destructive together.

519
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,460
You see this with people that are drinking different stuff like that.

520
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,760
And they drink themselves into the stupidity.

521
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,940
And that's when you're introducing something.

522
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,700
This is more like a withdrawal, like you're withdrawing from a certain aspect.

523
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,160
But either way, you're changing the equation.

524
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,860
You're changing the initial agreement. Right.

525
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,040
I mean, yeah, I've known of a couple that drank a lot

526
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,940
and one decided to stop and they broke up because one wanted to continue.

527
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,380
And the other one wanted to stop.

528
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,680
Well, either that or they'll just descend into it

529
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,000
and, you know, drink themselves until their liver dies.

530
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,080
And then the other one dies to not too long after.

531
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,920
I mean, I've seen them defend and, you know, descend into darkness together.

532
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,380
And I've been a participant in some of that mess myself.

533
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,520
No, I understand me, too.

534
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,300
But here's the thing. You can't bring the OK.

535
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,460
Ultimately, you know what these holidays are.

536
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,020
It's an intelligence op to see who will go along with it

537
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,940
and those that don't go along with it.

538
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,160
And I'm not talking because you're Muslim or a certain sect.

539
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,720
No, they got other things for them.

540
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,380
They got other things for them, too.

541
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm talking about if you're not going along with it,

542
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,720
because you've actually, quote unquote, researched it

543
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,880
and you have a fundamental understanding of what's going on.

544
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,860
It basically you become you go on the list now of those that could be watched.

545
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,980
Right. Yeah, exactly.

546
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,740
You know, because if you're a Muslim, you're just going to do Eid day

547
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,760
or you're going to do the.

548
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,120
Yeah, you're still in the same stuff. Something.

549
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,080
Yeah. I like what Archaic says about Jason Boucher's.

550
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,180
It's dungeon programming, he calls it.

551
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
You're still in the program.

552
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,400
Yeah, they offer you.

553
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,600
It's kind of like the the vending machine, you know, with the chips at the hospital

554
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
or every, you know, the convenience.

555
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,280
You know, like they got all these rows, you know, they got the Funyuns

556
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,920
and the Doritos and the one and the potato chips and the other one.

557
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,440
They got the multicolored ones and they got the candy bars.

558
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,860
As long as it doesn't.

559
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,980
The reason they have all these offerings.

560
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,800
The thing is, when you go within five feet of that vending machine,

561
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
you got to put money in and pull the lever.

562
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,340
They don't care what you take.

563
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,420
That's what all these religions are.

564
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,840
All the religions, by the way, I've got the seal of approval from the pope.

565
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,580
All of them. Right. Don't believe the fight.

566
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah. If you start a religion or there's a religion that doesn't have

567
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,860
this, the approval of the pope, I'm talking about the past 500 years

568
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,320
approval of the pope. You are done.

569
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,940
They will come in and clean you out.

570
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,260
Literally, you know, take you out.

571
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,260
So, yeah. So all of them are a form of that program

572
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,300
and an intelligence op because. Yeah.

573
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
So that's very simple way to put it.

574
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,600
And look, the this is an apologetic,

575
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,520
you know, apologetic means to defend one's position.

576
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,660
Right. Right. So the thing is, look.

577
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,480
No, I didn't hear any offense here.

578
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,580
I heard you just say, look, this is what will result if you do this.

579
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,620
That's not apologizing for it at all.

580
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,780
That's just telling you what's this is the logical conclusion to this action.

581
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,100
I mean, I think that's reasonable.

582
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Actually, everything here belongs here.

583
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,740
The mental stuff is open.

584
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,240
You want to imagine your imagination is unlimited and it's also infinite.

585
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,880
I think I've talked about the capacity of the human mind.

586
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,720
Everyone can memorize everything.

587
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,380
We just taught that we can't and then we're limited. Right.

588
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,300
And we've also been downgraded as time goes on.

589
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,840
So and if you don't think humans have been downgraded as time goes on,

590
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,320
go watch some old black and white films and look at the facial features of people.

591
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,260
Look how prominent their features are.

592
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,440
And then switch over to a modern crowd,

593
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,620
you know, like people walking and there's people with cameras, you know,

594
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,900
doing walks in Fifth Avenue in Manhattan or any city in the world.

595
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,740
Look at their facial features.

596
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,860
They don't. Yeah. What are we looking for?

597
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,580
Is that this is typically we see the brows are smaller.

598
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,580
The eyebrows. Right. The brow bone.

599
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,660
The ears are smaller, which represents the overall constitution of the individual.

600
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,100
And the nose is much smaller and the faces are much rounder.

601
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,060
In other words, they look less developed.

602
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,080
This is just from a phrenological point of view.

603
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,400
Phrenology is the Greek phrenosis, the face, right.

604
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,280
Knowledge of face reading. Yeah.

605
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,060
By the way, all the phrenology books were on the FBI capture seizure list.

606
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,380
You know, the FBI has a book seizure list. Right. Right.

607
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,420
And it's not so it's not that programs aren't running so hot anymore

608
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,300
because now they just digitize it and take out whatever they want or get it lost.

609
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,240
Right. Yeah. But but the phrenology, I found some

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,740
there was a used bookstore here. I should have gotten it.

611
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,840
But phrenology book, it was under it was a National Socialist Party, 1937.

612
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,080
Nazis. Right. It was a Nazi book at a swastika and everything on it.

613
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,320
It was for the officers that when they ran into people and they wanted to

614
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,160
judge them, you know, their their racial purity, let's say. Right.

615
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,020
They went through this manual. Right.

616
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,880
And I was paging through is all in German and very well printed and all that.

617
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,460
And it was interesting because one of them, one of the faces,

618
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,700
the profiles was like almost like the gangster type that you see in a cartoon.

619
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,500
Right. And it's in Germany. It was dangerous.

620
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
This individual is dangerous.

621
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
You know, it was kind of trippy.

622
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,460
Yeah. So but anyway,

623
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,420
yeah, phrenology has been really banned

624
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,020
for some reason, because maybe it's true.

625
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,140
By the way, stereotype, the reason why it's called a stereotype,

626
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,280
it's because the word stereo means solid.

627
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,980
Right. It's a Greek word for meaning solid.

628
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,460
You know, we use it for, you know, the left and right speaker,

629
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,940
make a stereo solid image and type means type.

630
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,340
Right. In other words, categories.

631
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,660
So stereotypes.

632
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,880
The reason they're called stereotypes is because it's pretty solid.

633
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,720
And now they've turned it around and made stereotypes

634
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,640
something that should be what dismissed. Right.

635
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,740
Or not taken into account for.

636
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,140
Then why are they called stereotypes?

637
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,400
They would be called elusive types then.

638
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,420
Right. Or maybe types.

639
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,020
So, yeah, these things are not absolute,

640
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,440
but they are pretty general guidelines.

641
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,220
If you don't go to the more ridiculous end of it.

642
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,400
I mean, that's the truth of it.

643
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,820
Yeah. A stereotype.

644
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,260
Once you understand the validity of it.

645
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,100
Miles Davis, the horn player jazz.

646
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,140
When he lived in L.A., he bought a Ferrari.

647
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,700
And when he was still at the Ferrari dealership, he told the

648
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,380
the dealer, I want you to call the LAPD and tell him that Miles Davis

649
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,180
just bought a Ferrari. Right. Yeah.

650
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,300
Right. So, you know, you get it smart. Yes.

651
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,460
Yeah. Because he understands stereotypes. Right.

652
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,000
Absolutely. A black guy in a Ferrari is going to get pulled over.

653
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,780
You know, this is talking about 70s. Right.

654
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,400
A hundred percent of the time.

655
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,500
So, yeah. So he understood stereotypes.

656
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,560
So and so does the LAPD.

657
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
Hmm. No, definitely.
