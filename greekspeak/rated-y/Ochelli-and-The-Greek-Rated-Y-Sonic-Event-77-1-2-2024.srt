1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,040
77, and we're going to take a look at what's going on in the chat room, I guess, here on

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,600
Rated Y.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,420
Didn't get any other feedback this week in the email, but, you know, if you heard the

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,980
last one, you got the email addresses, so I refer you back to that one.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,080
Anyway, Greg, how are you doing tonight?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,760
Doing well.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,140
Well, you know, this is a hand-free operation for me, so I'm actually making some rolls

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,380
right now as we speak.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,220
I'm going to continue with what I was doing.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,500
Yeah, sushi rolls.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,300
Ah, yeah.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:44,400
I was going to ask you to clarify for, you know, those listening, because you say rolls,

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,280
they might think it's bread, right?

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Goes all kinds of ways.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
I've seen women take their shirt off and I see rolls.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,300
Yeah, that happens too.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,700
Anyway, yeah.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,660
So, yeah, let's do it.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,280
I might take a little smoke break.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,140
Yeah, in the chat, I've been bringing up Jason Breshears of Archaics a lot lately, and I'm

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,440
very grateful that he's doing and does what he does.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:17,240
And just to jump to the point, any criticism on him would have to be considered that his

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,740
own statement, right, let me just say, when you listen to Greek speak, it's Greek speak,

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,540
it's stuff that nobody that's born here knows, but people visiting here, right?

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
No one's paying attention, right?

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,100
His whole thing, his statement is that he is a chronologist.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,140
So once he, he is very apologetic or not apologetic when he broaches other topics, he'll be very

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,220
careful to say, I'm not expert on this, but he does get into them in great depth, right?

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,380
So my criticism on that would be just that.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,180
So as a chronologist, I wouldn't say he's impeccable, but very, very good.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,140
I think that the greatest thing that I've ever gotten from listening to his stuff is

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,680
the 138 cycle of the Phoenix, which he kind of uncovered many, many ways how it's in code

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
all around us anyway.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,160
And there's other two other bodies, you know, there's the Nemesis X and the other one, and

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,480
they all have different periodicities, you know, like a 138 years, 592 and 700 something,

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,480
right?

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,560
762 or 732.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,420
And that I'm grateful for because it does line up with a lot of the disasters and calendrics

40
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,280
that we have.

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,280
He's brought up a lot of calendrics.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
I really didn't, I've never seen anyone break down the Mayan Papu Vuh, the Mayan calendar

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,860
and the Bactans as simply as he's done.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,300
There was a guy, Jose something who was pushing the Mayan calendar for a long time, even went

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,560
and spoke at the U.N.

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,580
Contreras.

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,040
I don't know what his, I forgot his name, but his associate used to come over to my

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,820
house for dinner, a white guy, and always talk about the effects of the Mayan calendar.

49
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,300
I asked him to explain it to me.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,440
And he's the guy working with the world renowned expert of the Mayan calendar, and he couldn't

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,860
explain it to me as clearly as Breshears does in 15 minutes on one of his sonics, right?

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,880
One of his shows.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,860
So, so hats off to that, right?

54
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,200
It's really good.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,780
And maybe I'm not the smartest tool in the shed.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,160
Maybe I couldn't understand it.

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,960
But the way he's able to explain certain things simply is very good.

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,740
A lot of the stuff I know from the folks listening to Greek speak will be in total contention

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,280
when they listen to Breshears talk about what's called the Bible and scriptures.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,100
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, basically, he's taking a stance that is almost

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,320
strictly Gnostic, where Yahweh is the Demiurge and referred to as Satan, right?

62
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
And all this other stuff.

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,040
And also regarding that aspect, he doesn't care or doesn't know about there is no crucifixion.

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,180
He doesn't care and doesn't know that there's no burning bush.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,240
He uses that analogy often, right?

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,600
Right.

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,560
So downright blasphemous, right?

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,820
From that point of view, right?

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,320
From the point of view like that, people that are like, if you're from the Bible Belt or

70
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,580
the belt buckle of the Bible Belt, you wouldn't be able to listen to him.

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,320
I listen to everything.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,360
I don't listen to everything, his stuff, but I listen to everyone, you know, a little bit

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,140
just to get a flavor and see where their direction is.

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,080
So I don't need to clarify my position on the Bible.

75
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,180
I told, you know, I don't believe any of it, but I need something.

76
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:31,980
Right.

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,640
Well, I know what I know out of it.

78
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,280
OK, when I say believe, you know what I mean, right?

79
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,840
It means that you don't know.

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
So you have to believe.

81
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,240
Right.

82
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,140
I only believe in what I know out of the scripture.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
So you know, I don't use it as a religious document.

84
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Right.

85
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,300
It's not my faith.

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,280
It's not my religion.

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
It's my law book.

88
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,320
That was the word I was looking for, faith, because that's that's what usually people

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,500
say.

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,380
Well, that's your faith.

91
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Right.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,740
So, you know, that's that's usually the key.

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,500
Totally different.

94
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,420
Yeah.

95
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,000
That's that.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,280
That could go different places.

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,160
The only time I have any kind of faith in what's called the Bible, which is in prophecy

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,700
and the true identity of the Messiah.

99
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,780
Right.

100
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,760
There's that, you know, because I'm not I wasn't there.

101
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,720
The only time you have to have faith is based on testimony.

102
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,780
Right.

103
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,320
Right.

104
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,140
So on that respect, I do.

105
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,020
Right.

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
But in terms of building a faith or no, no, I don't.

107
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,900
So, OK, yeah, I'm not I have no religion.

108
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,140
Right. Right. So but it's my right.

109
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,760
It's my basis. It's my law book.

110
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Right. And all that. So and I go there first, you know, whatever.

111
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,820
Right. My covenant, the covenant that I live by.

112
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,200
Right. So it's simple.

113
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,080
Right. OK.

114
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,360
On that part, it's very contentious with the archaic stuff.

115
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,620
So where would I start off by saying anything?

116
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,240
Well, first of all, he's a chronologist and it is very abbreviated on his chronology.

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,260
In other words, he does a chronology book, chrono something.

118
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,600
There's someone that read all of it.

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,200
And there's a YouTube with 200 something videos.

120
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,920
There is a lot more stuff in between some of those dates that he brings up in 1938

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,480
that were also very significant.

122
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,680
But again, the purpose of that, I think, is to muster up that hundred thirty eight

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,120
cycle year cycle, which the last time was 1902 and the next would be 2040.

124
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,660
And there's a lot of eschatology on the eschatology.

125
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,320
Part that I'm still the jury's out, you know, because I've been saying, you know,

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
twenty twenty five, twenty thirty two.

127
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,280
But he's saying it starts at twenty forty and all these other things.

128
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,420
Right. So we'll see.

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,780
It's so close enough. Right. We don't have a lot of time left.

130
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,500
Right. Well, relatively speaking, I mean, if you're talking about a difference of two

131
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,700
years, it's really not a big difference.

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,740
I mean, well, almost eight years or more, almost 15 years in some cases with other

133
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,500
things. So I'm not sure I just do the best I can with the chronology that I can get

134
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,920
out of the Bible itself.

135
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,360
He's gone outside, which I think is has a lot of validity because of the repetitive

136
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,360
cycles. And also the you've heard me say that the Bible is not inherently pure.

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
You know, it's very corrupted.

138
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,640
Right. Right. But in order for it to pass as being something holy or writ, it has to

139
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,900
have enough of that in it.

140
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,500
Right. Like, you know, like every lie has to have enough truth to make it believe.

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Rat poison is 98 percent pure starch and two percent, maybe less than two percent poison.

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,420
Right. Right. Right. So anything corrupted, you know, doesn't mean that, you know, the

143
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,680
all the content of the ingredients are not edible.

144
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Right. Unless it's mixed in severely.

145
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,460
So and I've also gone on record many times.

146
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,520
Don't even bother with the New Testament unless you've mastered the one before.

147
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,620
Right. Don't even bother with it at all.

148
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,320
You're just going to be you're going to get wrapped around the axle.

149
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,900
What do I mean about wrapped around the axle?

150
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,320
You know, when you're young, riding a bike and you have your pro kids, the old sneakers

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,340
with the extra long laces you get on your bike.

152
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right.

153
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,340
That's what will happen every time with everyone.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,960
If you just believe in any religion, that's going to tell you just read the New Testament

156
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
and that you're done. You're finished.

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
You're a hopeless case.

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Move over to the side.

159
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,680
You got nothing to say.

160
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
You know, you've got swallowed up by the collective and you're done.

161
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,460
Yeah. That's how I used to lose the bottoms of some of my pants, because they would be

162
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,920
ragged hanging. They'd get caught on a crank and that was the end of it.

163
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
They would just get wrapped around and gone.

164
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,620
Yeah, that's exactly the moment you believe that that's what you got to do.

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Just the New Testament. You're finished.

166
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,039
So it's Greek speak is not a place for you, for sure.

167
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,380
So you got to start somewhere.

168
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Right. And you start back to the basics now.

169
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,179
Right. He has a thing called the dark scriptures.

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,420
And he says, well, the academics say the Old Testament was written around the same time

171
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,740
as the New Testament. OK, that's all.

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
That's all he has to say about that.

173
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,380
Nothing else. Just the academics.

174
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,600
So we know how the academics.

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,220
Right. I mean, I'm sure they talk.

176
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,680
The academics talk about AIDS.

177
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
Right. And covid.

178
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,240
Right. So we've gone over that many times already.

179
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,340
Right. So it's not valid.

180
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,180
But there is no to besmirch or besmeet.

181
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,980
What was the man at all besmirch?

182
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,220
Because he states that he is basically a chronologist.

183
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,760
And on that, I find very little flaw.

184
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,820
And I'm actually grateful on that.

185
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,280
The rest of it, I take it more like the Fox News thing, like entertainment.

186
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,040
Remember, we talked about people taking Fox News seriously.

187
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,080
Then you launch a case against them, launch a case against them.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,180
And what does the court say? Fox News is entertainment.

189
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,720
What's your problem? Right.

190
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,740
So very often in the beginning, I'd say a while back when I started finding out about

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,000
it, I was like this brochures of archaics.

192
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Go listen to them. It's a Texas country.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
It meets the Internet. Right.

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,680
So that's fine.

195
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,960
I've got nothing against them.

196
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,180
I am grateful that he's a good enough chronologist to show the 138 year periodicity.

197
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,540
And that's pretty much in a nutshell.

198
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,040
There are little things they throws out.

199
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,800
I like some of the terms that he uses, like dungeon programming or breaking pattern and

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,240
things like that. I've adopted some of that and try to give him credit when credit what

201
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,840
I can. And that stuff, you know, here's the thing.

202
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,140
And I just got off a call, someone who reached out to me, a sub that knows the same

203
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,440
people we know in New York.

204
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,880
And Michio Kushi, Shizuko Yamamoto, and basically we said, you know, so how am I doing

205
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,240
on the stuff? He's doing great.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,240
You know, it's macrobotic, you know, the yin and yang, because he's a veteran.

207
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,320
He's 11 years older than I.

208
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,280
And he was around those people way before I was.

209
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,100
And basically the like Michio Kushi basically said, you do and you use what works

210
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,480
ultimately. Right.

211
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,480
If it works right, use it.

212
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,420
Right. In other words, if you form an opinion about something before you implement it and

213
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:04,160
you hold to that opinion instead of the virtues of what it has to offer, you're doing

214
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,180
yourself a disservice.

215
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,100
So if you have a sort of an opinion about something that is not venerated or high, but

216
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,000
that's something works, go ahead and use it.

217
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,180
Right. So so you can get it.

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,680
You can enjoy the features and benefits because others do.

219
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,640
Why not you instead of standing by and, you know, criticizing it?

220
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,040
Right. So it's like that with everything, including what we're talking about now with

221
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,500
our kids. You know, if there's anything you can take and use that you find useful, but

222
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
you have to objectify.

223
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,440
And even if it's subjective, look, everything ultimately is subjective because of our own

224
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,680
perception, perceptual limitations, but anything and anywhere you go, use it if you can

225
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,760
use it. I know ultimately we're asking why during this, you know, and that's what I

226
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,360
usually try to do. But in this case, I'm going to ask how, you know, how does one use

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,240
that chronological cycle?

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,320
How does one use recognition of these cycles?

229
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,680
How what would be the first step?

230
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,860
OK, now I recognize this.

231
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,860
I see that it is a psychic prophecy.

232
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,700
Prophecy. OK, I've gone over this many times with people are, you know, when Obama

233
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,500
came into office in the U.S., that there was a big survival Patriot movement.

234
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,120
Right. Well, that were up on everything, you know, people, people to this day, Greeks

235
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,900
still send me, you know, this stuff about Obama's the Antichrist, you know?

236
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,680
Yeah. Well, I know what the people.

237
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,240
Yeah. And one more thing, by the way, before we get into how to use it.

238
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,700
Go ahead. I don't know.

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,980
I you know, I've said I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever to the 10th

240
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,160
power, open a YouTube channel and put content.

241
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,140
That's what the YouTube people of content.

242
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,220
Right. So, I mean, that's what Internet content.

243
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,360
Right. Contents may settle.

244
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,480
Right. Anyway.

245
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,100
I would never do that because that platform to me, which is Google, is just something

246
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,220
that rubs me the wrong way.

247
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,680
Now, something private that you and I and Sam discussed the arc on is maybe we should

248
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,460
do some shorts, Greek speak, blurbs, two or three minutes and put them out.

249
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,840
They haven't been done. Right.

250
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,960
Still not out there. Right.

251
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,280
And I don't. Yeah.

252
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,840
I just said something about.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Yeah. YouTube is just whatever.

254
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,100
Whatever. Anyway, it's more than a bad date for me.

255
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,580
Right. But a lot of people have benefited greatly on it.

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,560
Right. Including the archaic fellow that went from living in a wooden shack to buying

257
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,080
three houses and two new cars.

258
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,540
Right. With YouTube and whatever else.

259
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,240
So it's not for me, you know.

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
But let's go back.

261
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,120
Obama Patriot movement got survivalist.

262
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh, because the world was going to end in 2020 or 2018.

263
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,480
Right. Remember? Remember, it's 2014, whatever.

264
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,100
Yeah. World's going to go.

265
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm like, no, it can't, because I know prophecy.

266
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
There's a certain amount of things that have to happen.

267
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,460
Right. And I think I've been a far more correct.

268
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,860
And yeah.

269
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,260
So if they're telling you the world's going to end in 2019, what was when did they say

270
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,320
September 2019?

271
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,540
Remember, September 23rd, 2019 was a big one.

272
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,820
Or was it 18 or 17?

273
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,100
You know what? I'm mixing that one up.

274
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,980
I think it was 2019.

275
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,560
But the first big thing, of course, was the Mayan calendar, which you started with

276
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,880
here. That guy, Jose, began with an A.

277
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
I can't remember his name.

278
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Yeah. His associate used to come over here and have dinner at the house all the

279
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,540
time. And when he invited me to his place, by the way, I showed up with my

280
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,680
pots, pans, some rice and my knives.

281
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,060
And I said, what are you guys having for dinner?

282
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,960
He's like salmon burgers frozen from Trader Joe's.

283
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm like, oh, no, no, I'm cooking.

284
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,820
I'm going to make a nice meal for everybody.

285
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,620
First time he had a nice meal in years, probably.

286
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,700
But anyway. Right, right.

287
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,520
Yeah. Well, the main thing about the Mayan calendar is it's 360 days versus 365.

288
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,260
In the 50s, when they did the Mayan bactons with 365, it was 2012.

289
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,880
The math was correct, just the year number.

290
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,860
But in 713 B.C., we went from 360 days to 365 days a year and a quarter.

291
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,680
Right. So if you factor in the Mayan calendars based on 360 days, it ends up being

292
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,620
May 2040.

293
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,700
So it's pretty accurate. Elected 2046.

294
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,520
Sorry. 2046 is when time will end.

295
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,700
Right. OK, so that seems to be cleared up

296
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,220
pretty well on that.

297
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,140
But no, not much.

298
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,580
What I found using the prophetic stuff, which might be right, might be wrong.

299
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,420
Right now, I'm looking at more of the archaic stuff, see if I could piece it together.

300
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,620
What I've cobbled together and the jury's out.

301
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,660
I'll do a presentation on it if I find out which way or what.

302
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,020
But I find 2025 to 2027 to being critical in terms of everything flipping.

303
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,860
Right. You know, so.

304
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,460
Yeah, so that's where I'm at with that now.

305
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,340
And what I like, one of the comments in the chat was, because would you please talk

306
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,640
about archaics? And, you know, it's bringing in someone else, you know, someone else

307
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,640
here, just Greek speak, you know, Shelley and the Greek and all that, because we're all

308
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,200
here to learn. And it was like a little conditional thing, you know, and absolutely

309
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,620
you don't you don't even say we're all here to learn.

310
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,900
Absolutely. If there's anything, anyone out there at all worth listening to, listen

311
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,840
to them. Right.

312
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,980
Of course. And we'll always discuss it.

313
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,780
But just don't fall for like I won't mention names like Cliff High, people that sound

314
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,380
smart but are not smart.

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,420
Oh, what did I do? Did I just.

316
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,360
Oh, yeah. OK.

317
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,700
You might have. Yeah.

318
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,720
All right. Yeah.

319
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,680
Yeah. But stuff like that, like that's that's study that one and you'll see what I'm

320
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,300
talking about. There's nothing there.

321
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
It sounds like most professors.

322
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,480
Right. They sound smart.

323
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,380
But go have lunch with them.

324
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,480
You're like, this guy's a real dummy.

325
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,480
He's just learned how to speak by watching other people speaking.

326
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,580
Right. Don't fall for that.

327
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,560
Right. Don't fall for the.

328
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,440
There was a film the BBC did a while back, Brave New World.

329
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,020
It was a three hour film on the Aldous Huxley book, Brave New World.

330
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,700
Right. And one of the savages, you know, they called him that lived outside the

331
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,440
communities, had found a Shakespeare book.

332
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,800
And when he spoke, all he could say was recites the what he read out of the

333
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,819
Shakespeare book. Right.

334
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
Right. So.

335
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh, no. And I find that, you know, people often refer to it as the monkey see monkey

336
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,580
do kind of thing. I find that all over the place, though, that you'll find sometimes

337
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,600
I call them parrots and all that's all they do.

338
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,420
And it doesn't even have to be good information.

339
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,840
They just find something to their liking and they mimic it.

340
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,800
And you can hear the shallow whatever, even in like all media

341
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,740
circles. Right. Which hardly exist anymore.

342
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,280
But to the extent that they do, you got people sitting there that are just repeating

343
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,580
buzz phrases from stuff they saw on YouTube.

344
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,040
I mean, you know, like the old PBS, you know, the petroleum broadcasting company.

345
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,900
I mean, the public broadcasting service.

346
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,760
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,240
They sound, you know, right.

348
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,680
When you turn into PBS or whatever.

349
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Oh, they sound so smart.

350
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,220
Right. Yeah. It's all real smart.

351
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,560
But all they're doing is, again, running the same.

352
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,820
Anyways, I find it's a style of speech, let's say.

353
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,840
But but someone who actually, you know, does some work and discovers something, of

354
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,680
course, take a listen, see what it is they discovered.

355
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
But there are a lot of parrots out there.

356
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,480
And I mean, I guess there's something to sit in and listen in the course as a parrot,

357
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
if that's what you want to do.

358
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,180
You know, Papagayo in Latin, we call it Papagayo.

359
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
Well, it could be that.

360
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,480
But she's a parrot.

361
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,720
Yes, exactly.

362
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,620
It could be that. And but the thing is, it doesn't get you anywhere.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
You can do it if you're entertained by it.

364
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,380
But no, no, no, no. It does get you.

365
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
Oh, are you kidding? Are you kidding me?

366
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,740
Entire communities, entire societies are based on that.

367
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,460
Well, fluff. No, right.

368
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,240
It's all no, no. So it's the cover.

369
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,720
It's the no, it does get you.

370
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,300
Are you kidding? Well, no, that kind of I'm not being contentious.

371
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm just saying that it's not a certain way that triggers people

372
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,700
that you're smart or whatever.

373
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,320
You're going to get a lot of people.

374
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,340
You know, I see that.

375
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,660
And I see that there are people that look, if you learn how to behave a certain way

376
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,960
and you meet people's expectations, you'll be rewarded.

377
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,160
That's for sure.

378
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,160
But I don't find it rewarding.

379
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,380
You know, I was on YouTube also, but I never got these big rewards

380
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,320
because I didn't do the stuff that you're supposed to do.

381
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,660
You have to behave a certain way.

382
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,840
You have to back. Let's back up now with the YouTube thing.

383
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm not here to disparage anyone on YouTube.

384
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,820
I use YouTube a lot. I call it YouTube University.

385
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,960
I told someone once I was doing some car work, go to YouTube University.

386
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,860
You'll find a video.

387
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,600
He kept looking YouTube University.

388
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,880
I couldn't find it. No, no, no.

389
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,300
I just YouTube. Just YouTube.

390
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,180
Because, you know, you see a lot of people, you know, if I have to change,

391
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,520
let's say a guidance module in, you know, in a Maytag washer.

392
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,180
You know, I'd rather watch a video right from 10 minutes. Right.

393
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,080
Look, exactly. Before I do it.

394
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,520
I've had glitches with software.

395
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,840
I've had computer issues.

396
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,580
I've had things and I've been able to clear it up.

397
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,560
My mixer, the first mixer I got, something broke on it.

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,240
I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it.

399
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,620
And I went on YouTube to see if somebody had a video on that mixer.

400
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,320
You know what? Took about 10 minutes and I knew I could diagnose the problem.

401
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,980
You got familiar. Yeah.

402
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,140
You know, it was just a great.

403
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,220
Here's the thing. Let me just clarify.

404
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,600
The thing that I disparage YouTube about is purely a personal problem,

405
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,180
meaning my problem with it.

406
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,580
I have a personal preference

407
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,860
that I find it problematic with my own persona.

408
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,600
Like if I had to sit down and say we're putting doing a YouTube video,

409
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,800
I am or whatever, I'm like.

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,100
Now, I have done interviews that I've been on there, of course.

411
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,180
O and G and all that we have gotten when we did the O and G back then.

412
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,680
You did put them up on YouTube and we got fantastic response.

413
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,520
You actually brought brought it further to a further wider audience, I should say.

414
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,360
Right. And people did find out about it and they were quite happy.

415
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,620
Most of the comments, if not all the comments were positive.

416
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,200
Not that they should be, but they were.

417
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
So, yeah, it was a success.

418
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,960
Yeah, I'm thinking the Freeman at some point.

419
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,100
No, no, definitely.

420
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,800
And I'm thinking at some point we should stick just and, you know,

421
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
a sonic up on YouTube somewhere just to have it there.

422
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
And well, yeah, in other words, I am not a YouTube country.

423
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
I decided a long time ago not to

424
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,340
to do that because there was just something.

425
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,540
Again, I'm not being dualistic because I do use it.

426
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
But it doesn't feel right to engage with it.

427
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,920
As you know, I got just something about it.

428
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,360
But by the way, I did.

429
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,660
Intuitively, it did prove correct with all the censorship that came about before.

430
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,160
Could you imagine doing a video up there

431
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,600
talking about how the aid scam really works and all this stuff?

432
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,740
Could you how long would that look?

433
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,260
That would not have made it, you know, they call it YouTube community guidelines.

434
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,000
What do they call it?

435
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Oh, yeah, exactly.

436
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,660
No, we'd get hit with YouTube community guidelines possibly within the hour.

437
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,600
We'd be taking it. Right, right. Exactly.

438
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,760
And they were probably the I would probably alert a human.

439
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,940
Exactly. Yeah.

440
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,760
The I would flag it and then say, hey, get some human

441
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,760
intel behind this and find out this guy's dangerous,

442
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,040
you know, in terms of what we're trying to do here.

443
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,480
You know, medical disinformation, as they call it now.

444
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,560
Yeah, that's a new term.

445
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,060
As a matter of fact, yeah, you know, just about everything

446
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,740
medical is disinformation, right?

447
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Well, we know that.

448
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,820
But that would be their terminology.

449
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,360
Yeah, we yeah, we know that they believe that it's not right.

450
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:24,880
There's a difference.

451
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,360
You see the choice of words.

452
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,940
There are very specific. Exactly.

453
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,320
So we know. Yeah.

454
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,020
Yeah. Yeah. So that's pretty much all I have to say.

455
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,340
I am taking into account the chronology

456
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,840
in terms of eschatology, meaning the things to come.

457
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,500
And that's still out.

458
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,740
And when I do feel like I can do a presentation on it

459
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,440
and whatever, I will do a presentation on it.

460
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,940
You know what the archaic material and other material is.

461
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,340
By the way, there's no other material other than archaics and Greek speaks stuff.

462
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
There's nothing else out there.

463
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,960
Well, if you start bringing up any eschatology, guess what?

464
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,840
You end up with a Judeo Christian website, which is if you go there, you're lost.

465
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,300
Yeah, because even if they begin to hint at anything outside of it,

466
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,640
eventually it'll get back to, OK, you know what?

467
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,720
I'll tell you what it earns you on on YouTube.

468
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,080
University is unless you're paying the premium,

469
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,240
you'll start getting commercials for churches.

470
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,620
So, you know, either way.

471
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,800
No, I'm just saying the mentality.

472
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,840
I mean, anything religious in any any form, you know, is not good.

473
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,600
You know, you know, and you can see who falls for it.

474
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,040
But that's my point is that the artificial is geared to do what?

475
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,500
OK, it's geared to sell you products.

476
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,620
It's geared to engage with you in products that it knows

477
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,440
you want based on stuff you're doing.

478
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,220
So guess what?

479
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,080
The A.I. turns around and twists your commercial grabs to that.

480
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,040
So what I'm telling you is that the the the, you know, rudimentary thing

481
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,400
that is the A.I. that does feed your feed, right?

482
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,220
Well, by the way, it's not really A.I.

483
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,120
It's just very fast network, right?

484
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,040
Comparative, right?

485
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,400
You know, we we live in I think I brought this up even before

486
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,980
because we there is a cosmic A.I.

487
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,400
Right. And let me just bring this up because this is our case is for stands

488
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,920
for artificial intelligence X or something, right?

489
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,040
So the reason the logic that I came up that we are in an artificial

490
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,880
intelligence system, which will not let it like our cakes,

491
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,260
another artificial intelligence to to take hold is very simple.

492
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,720
If you are very advanced at whatever,

493
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,760
let's say to the point where you're advanced to doing everything.

494
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,100
Don't you build?

495
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,400
You know, one of them I spoke to years ago in the 80s, an anthropologist.

496
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,240
And so what makes anthropology so interesting is for him,

497
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,480
it was because you can watch the development of human society

498
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,020
and gauge it by the tools that they make.

499
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,460
And as the and the way society is considered advanced is by how advanced

500
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,400
not they are personally, but their tools. Right.

501
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,100
And that's why I was bringing it up, because I recently spoke with Blake

502
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,020
Lemoine, who is the A.I.

503
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,160
engineer that they fired from Google, if you remember the one that.

504
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Yeah.

505
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,040
So, you know, and that's why I'm bringing it up, because it's

506
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,220
due to the feed.

507
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,680
What I'm saying is that the tool that they use is to attract you.

508
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,020
Once you start digging into these things that way,

509
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,700
they're going to immediately divert you into the standardized

510
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,020
Judeo-Christian religion that are available.

511
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,080
Oh, yeah, I get it.

512
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,320
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

513
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Hold up. Sure.

514
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,280
Let me just the thought is.

515
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,140
So if you're a quote, unquote, let me just get maybe make it a little couch

516
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,080
and a little more abbreviated.

517
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,540
If you're a god, you don't have to do anything.

518
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,360
You can make tools and other gods or other things to do it for you.

519
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,700
Right. Right.

520
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,660
Think about your super powerful.

521
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,860
Why do you go out and dig ditches?

522
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
You don't. You have a machine that does it.

523
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,380
And if the machine needs to be operated, you make another machine

524
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,200
to operate that machine, another machine to operate that machine.

525
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,280
And that includes biological machines, of course, meaning animals or people.

526
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,880
Right. So when you get to a certain point where you are

527
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,000
sort of not a demiurge, but basically everything comes out from your direction.

528
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,620
You like the captain of a ship.

529
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,320
You don't do any.

530
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,280
The captain of the ship doesn't do anything, even when,

531
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,000
you know, five degrees to starboard. Right.

532
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,720
Does he go and turn the rudder?

533
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,100
No, someone else does.

534
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,280
Look, I know you bring up Star Trek every once in a while,

535
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
but take a look at what the captain does on Star Trek.

536
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,720
He doesn't actually fly the ship.

537
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,800
No, he tells Sulu, take it out.

538
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,440
You know what I'm saying?

539
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,660
He tells it. Look, take it out of space, Doc.

540
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,060
OK, go. He gives them exact directions.

541
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,720
And that guy. So and that's just the captain of the ship.

542
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,440
Imagine someone much, much higher.

543
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,880
That's a captain of a planet or a solar system or a universe.

544
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,900
You would have even more elaborate machines.

545
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,600
As a matter of fact, your devices, machines, contraptions and creations

546
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,360
would be so elaborate that some would even mistake those as gods.

547
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,540
You see what I mean? Exactly.

548
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,760
So we are in an off course, you know, when creation and things are done,

549
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
they are not done directly or indirect.

550
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,320
It would be I cannot imagine that they would be done directly at all.

551
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,280
It doesn't make any sense that they would the gods, quote, unquote,

552
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,240
would do anything directly.

553
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,920
They would have things that they've made do it. Right.

554
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,260
So that's why I believe that the the artificial intelligence is us

555
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,800
mimicking that.

556
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,240
And of course, what they're putting out to the public, you tell people it's a I.

557
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,660
And it sort of acts like a I.

558
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,560
And, you know, it's not a I.

559
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,320
I think we have Megsy here.

560
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,920
She did some stuff with the chat, GBT, and they made fun of Christianity.

561
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,540
But when it comes time for Islam, so I can't make fun of anything religious.

562
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,540
So you can see, in other words, you know, the chat, GBT is a woke agenda.

563
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,620
One hundred percent. Right.

564
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Yeah. Supposedly. Right.

565
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,540
Yeah. It's all woke, you know, which is goes back to hope.

566
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,200
You know, sizzling liquid there.

567
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,120
I hope you didn't come in too loud as loud here.

568
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,860
No, I'm OK. OK.

569
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,580
So, yeah. In other words, it's all agendas you look.

570
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,000
You know how I say, if if you've ever heard of someone's name, seen their picture,

571
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,400
their face, even historically, their voice or they're not in power, none of them.

572
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You've never seen.

573
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,860
We don't know who's in power, because once you get to the point

574
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,680
where you do have a power, you one of the things you make sure

575
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,400
is that no one knows who you are, what you look like, what your name, blah, blah, blah.

576
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,500
That is the first priority. Right.

577
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,620
That's why. Because that's how you maintain it.

578
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,020
Exactly. So everybody I'm talking about, George Washington,

579
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,340
all the way, all the presidents, right, all the they're all

580
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,540
delegates, they take delegation. Right.

581
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,540
So, again, they think about it.

582
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,400
If there was an A.I., a real A.I. that humans did,

583
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,240
they would never let you know that there was no.

584
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,820
So it's it can't be A.I.

585
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,000
Right. Could not possibly be revealed.

586
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,280
But again, you know, it reminds me of that old phrase, right?

587
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,040
You'll know you'll know them by their works.

588
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,400
You'll know them by what it is they created,

589
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,560
not them directly, because that's not the way it goes. Right.

590
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,660
Yep.
