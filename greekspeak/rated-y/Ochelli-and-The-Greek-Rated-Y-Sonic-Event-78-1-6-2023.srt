1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,480
78 is the sonic event we're on right now, Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, so a couple things

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,280
in the chat, or one thing in the chat really, and you put a few pictures in there, but first

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,940
off how you doing?

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm doing good, feeling spicy, so this should be a good one.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,240
Little bit, little bit, I'll tell you, you know sometimes I try to hit the button a little

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,940
early sometimes.

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,940
Come on, hit the button, let's go, come on, let's get this road on the show, come on.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,300
That too, he's anxious, anxious to talk tonight, okay, good.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,860
Well, yeah, okay, we could, no, no, no, no, no, not like that, it's different.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,300
It sounds like it, I gotta tell you, all right, hey look, I am willing to accept that I am

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,480
possibly wrong about every single thing, it's fine, and I have the flexibility to try and

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,580
learn.

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,300
That's going to require a lot of apologetics, because we've been doing this for a long time,

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,120
you shouldn't say that.

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,060
Well, I don't need to apologize, hey.

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, you know what, I mean the real meaning of apologize, like the real meaning of the

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
word nice, you know, it means to defend something.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,300
Yes, I understand, I was making a joke, but it didn't land.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,560
All right, anyway, it's okay, I'm not a comedian either, but let's get back to it.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,320
You just look like one.

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,880
No, look, looks aren't, I'm not funny, but looks aren't everything, right?

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,260
Anyhow, they can be, though, as long as you're smarter than you look, that's what counts

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,840
in tough people.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,580
And if you don't have either, then what, right, you just got a face for radio, and you got

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,100
to hope your voice will pull you through.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,160
That's right.

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,920
Don't push.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,580
If you don't, bang the table, bang the juror, right?

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
All right, anyways.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Yeah, let's get to the chat, okay, before we get to the chat, if you get to the chat,

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,680
I put up some more pics on the Scalarator Mark 1.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,220
This one was one that's got, I call it the 700, but it's really five, someone pointed

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,500
out, it's really 540 degrees wraparound, not 700.

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,580
But the reason I call it a 700 is because the straight pieces count as part of the circle,

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,860
because whenever you're using circles, you will, and let's say you have like the letter

36
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,140
Q, or the letter P, which is a semi circle or full circle with an appendage, right?

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,540
You should always count the straight part as part of the length of the circle, even

38
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,220
though it's straight.

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,800
Now, why?

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,980
This is another discussion.

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,180
But on the Mark 1, the water devices, they have like two straight legs, right?

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,000
Usually in a line.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,640
I count that length as part of the circular degrees, right?

44
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,580
So even though it's a 360 going around, it's right.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
So anyway, I call it the 700.

46
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,300
The purpose of building it this way is to show people that you can overlap the pipe.

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
It actually works a little bit better.

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,180
Every little small thing, improvement that you make, if you notice you get an improvement

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,740
in the water quality, it should be noted, right?

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,700
You know how it's just each little increment, is it worth it to do it every time?

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:02,980
No.

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,920
It's not that much of an improvement.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,180
Did you discover this incrementally or did you just keep kind of tweaking it to improve

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,320
it?

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,360
Constantly.

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,260
Well, these are downloads that I get, their inspiration, gut feelings, mistakes that I've

57
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,940
made.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,660
Okay.

59
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,060
Something doesn't come out right.

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
So let's make tests.

61
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,760
Let's make tests.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,040
Right.

63
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,020
Let's make tests.

64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,220
Right.

65
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,220
I learned it from a Russian.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,220
Anyway, guy at the mines, whenever something is like, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, don't

67
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,620
do that.

68
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,540
Make tests first.

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,500
Okay.

70
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,320
So let's make tests anyway.

71
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,700
And I noticed that the extra wraparound, you got to keep it away from the faces of the magnet,

72
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:42,920
right?

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,300
You want to use that block wall.

74
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,540
This is situated this way.

75
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,180
I even put plastic threads, male threads, cause it's going to get flex connectors.

76
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,560
We only have about six inches of water main we can get to.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
Now we can't mess it up.

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,560
It's only like imagine six inches access to the water main.

79
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,000
That's it.

80
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,760
So if you mess it up, it's like you just asked yourself pretty good.

81
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,960
So what we're going to do is going to cut into it, put two 90 degree elbows to come

82
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
out of that little six inch zone.

83
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,880
So we could put some flex connectors and have this in line.

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,260
And I just wanted to show this because it's like, I promised I'll keep people updated.

85
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,780
And then I have the net, the newer versions and the upgrades are going to have flow forms

86
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,940
built into the pipes, like the Shaw burger stuff.

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,000
And I have even a pipe cut open and these flow forms are molded into the plastic.

88
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,320
And like I said, I'll keep updating.

89
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,720
Now, a few months ago, I said about the water tech, speaking to some people in the corporate

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,340
and they wanted in order to honestly, would you keep it hush hush for a while?

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,320
And I said, yes.

92
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,280
So in order to honor that, I told everyone, look, I got to keep things hush hush for a

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,580
little while.

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
But that little while is over now.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,100
Nothing much has come.

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,260
I don't think much will come because there's a lack of maturity.

97
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,500
So the next thing here is to keep spreading this out.

98
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,660
And what I want to do is a quote unquote seminar on Skype.

99
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,760
Anybody in the chat, you could reach out in the chat.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,420
You could reach out through the email, Uncommon Sense, radio one at Gmail dot com.

101
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,200
It's number one.

102
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,660
Right.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,860
And let me know you want to be a part of it.

104
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,560
If I get three, four, five, six, seven, eight people, we'll do a Skype date.

105
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,120
I'll message everyone back when it is.

106
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,800
It'll be on Skype.

107
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,840
No, I don't do Zoom.

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,060
I don't follow the collective.

109
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,820
And Skype is way better or anybody else has something as good as Skype or whatever.

110
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,620
We'll have it there.

111
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,100
And what I'll do is, well, it'll be an open time or however long it takes.

112
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,800
I estimate an hour to two hours.

113
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,740
I'll do a slide show that I'll post images, tech documents, whatever, history, installations,

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,180
all that stuff, things that I've discovered, things that directions it could go and what

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,760
it could do.

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,900
There'll be a physicist present who's on staff, by the way.

117
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:53,900
Yes.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,840
A fizzy, not a physicist, but a physicist, however you want to spell it anyway.

119
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,540
So yeah.

120
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,160
So I just want to put that out.

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,500
I just want to, because I said a while back, I got to keep tight lipped because some dealings,

122
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,240
those dealings are now done.

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,140
And I think it's, you know, I got to live up to what I say.

124
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,360
Right.

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,960
Of course.

126
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,220
Of course.

127
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,800
Well, you know, and there's a there's an interesting thing because I actually got an email this

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,040
week about the old water episode that you and I did a few years back.

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,040
And somebody was saying that they were looking for it and they wanted to know if it was going

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,000
to be part of Rated Y.

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
But this is this is different.

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,440
This is specifically on this device and similar devices.

133
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,500
No, I get it.

134
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,780
But you mentioned the form.

135
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,460
And I was thinking to myself, well, I wonder if that has anything to do with like what you

136
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,000
mentioned in that one about the shape of the container and how this is completely.

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,120
This is a new.

138
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,140
This is actually if anyone's got more than two sharpened pencils in their pocket, they're

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,260
going to realize this has nothing to do with water.

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,600
This is actually a leap in physics.

141
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,080
This is something that the current physics is not acknowledging.

142
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,460
And without getting into it here on this sonic, they got the poles right of the magnet.

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,280
And then they this thing they call the block wall or the Neal wall.

144
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,800
And they dismiss the whole thing.

145
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
They acknowledge it.

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,700
Then they got dynamic formulas.

147
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,500
They tell you it's a thousand angstroms wide.

148
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:15,760
Right.

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,580
Which is ridiculous.

150
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,280
You know, hydrogen atoms like eight thousand angstroms wide.

151
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,560
So it's just a typical physicist stuff.

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,960
Right.

153
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,600
Bullshit.

154
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,840
But just to keep you away, I'm sure it's being used, but not in the public.

155
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,940
So now we've found and show that there are dynamic results by using that.

156
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,380
There's many, many applications.

157
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,140
We could talk a little bit about that.

158
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,900
But this is not the water business.

159
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,980
This is the physics business, which is we do not want to get into anything that crosses

160
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,500
lines with academia and industry, because they will hound you to the grave.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,340
And after you're dead and they make sure you're done and forgot it, they pick it up and take

162
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
it and carry it as if it's theirs.

163
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:55,880
Of course.

164
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
So they can go eat a dick.

165
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,980
They can eat two dicks.

166
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,180
As a matter of fact, the academics and the establishment and what did I just say that?

167
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,820
Yeah, anyway.

168
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,360
And it is.

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,220
Yeah.

170
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,760
So I'm not interested in that.

171
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,680
So the thing is to get it out on the I don't say grass level roots.

172
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,740
I don't believe in that either.

173
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,080
People you people who are good with working and building stuff.

174
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,880
Right.

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,020
Right.

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,040
Right.

177
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,420
Like sometimes I've talked to someone about building this and are like, oh, yeah, we need

178
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,880
all this.

179
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,260
And so I'm like, are you joking?

180
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,580
Look at it.

181
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,620
My two neighbors down two houses down.

182
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,860
They have a daughter that's just started high school and her eight year old brother can make

183
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,059
it.

184
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,880
What do you mean?

185
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,200
You're going to meet with a bunch of engineers and spend a hundred.

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Are you joking?

187
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,860
No.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,799
Get out of here.

189
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:46,260
You know, all you need is a guy with a shed and fair enough tools who can eyeball something

190
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,540
and go, OK, I know how to do.

191
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:47,840
Yeah.

192
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,420
Who's that?

193
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,380
Who's has tactile control?

194
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,320
You know, like baseball is tactile control.

195
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,720
You know, you have control of everything in your eyes, coordinate in your ears and everything

196
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,180
coordinates right in your body.

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,980
So, yeah, it's it's sad.

198
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,820
It's it's it's always been sad.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Like, you know, anyway.

200
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,200
Of course.

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,500
So if people are interested, this is not water a meeting I want to have.

202
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,200
It's strictly on developing this building through the council of the multitude comes

203
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,600
wisdom.

204
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,540
There's a certain aspect that I believe that if you get enough people involved, that someone's

205
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,900
going to come up with something, no matter how long it takes, there's always a slight

206
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,340
improvement.

207
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,300
All that's welcome.

208
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,460
Yeah.

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,180
So what were you going to talk about?

210
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,760
Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,100
Well, in the chat posted something about three dimensional thinking.

212
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,680
And my response to that was, I may not say what you want to hear now.

213
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,480
It's weird because I saw it differently.

214
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,460
They seem to imply to me almost like they want the Greek speak version of feng shui,

215
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,560
which is an interesting term that has, you know, gained popularity in the past.

216
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:50,920
I don't know.

217
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,000
Two decades or so.

218
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,780
You know, this Asian concept of moving things around in a room, arranging it so that energy

219
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,040
is directed through that room in a certain way, the furnishings, the decoration, etc.

220
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,400
You know.

221
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,580
And that's about all I know about it.

222
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,360
OK.

223
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,020
OK, good.

224
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,400
So let's stop right there.

225
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,480
Let's let's circle back to the direct question of three dimensional thinking and we'll finish

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,100
off with the part you don't want to hear.

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,260
Let's get into the feng shui, feng shui, feng shui.

228
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,460
If you're speaking another dialect, which means water, wind, basically now.

229
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,520
Real simple.

230
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,020
Don't start with that.

231
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,440
You want to get a preliminary idea of how you fit in it as an individual.

232
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,840
You got to look up something called nine star key.

233
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,580
And the key is with a K.I.

234
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,900
As a very watered down subject, again, Michio Kushi revived that a while back.

235
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,100
Now, what nine star key is, it's like horoscopes, but it's not like horoscopes because horoscopes

236
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
are just plain dumb.

237
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,600
Nine star key was based on over 4000 years of surveying people and keeping information.

238
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
So what does that mean?

239
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,280
I'll give you an example.

240
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,180
There's a village, let's say 4000 years ago, and they got a summary of the village who

241
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,640
did what when they were born, right?

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,400
What they looked like, like beauty marks, you know, high facial structure, everything.

243
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:17,720
Right.

244
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:23,720
OK, so let's say they went back and reviewed a town and every time this person started

245
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,680
business, it failed.

246
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,420
And every time this other person started a business, it succeeded.

247
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,820
So they studied the person whose businesses failed consistently, everything, beauty marks,

248
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,060
when they were born, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

249
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,020
And then they studied the person whose business succeeded, their height, their size, their

250
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,860
beauty marks, facial stuff, all that kind, right?

251
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,000
When they were born and they made a record.

252
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,240
Well, eventually they found out that all the people who started businesses and failed

253
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,100
had similar beauty marks, similar days when they were born through the year.

254
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,120
Right. And then they noticed the people who were successful starting.

255
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm just using this as a model, by the way.

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,680
There is no category for who looks, you know, successful, but who doesn't.

257
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,320
But no, but this is an interesting thing, because, you know, throughout mankind's

258
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,440
existence, it seems to me as though people have attempted to come up with a way to

259
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,700
draw a map.

260
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,160
Basically, but this is done not because what's in the stars at all.

261
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,000
A little bit. Well, a little bit.

262
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
Because the horoscopes are made up, by the way.

263
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,780
But when they were born, I got you.

264
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,240
But when they were born and all that, that's your horoscope part.

265
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,860
But sometimes they say, oh, but people that have certain personality traits, you know,

266
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,840
certain this or that trait or whatever, this is what they're meant to do.

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,540
Right. Yeah, but this is far more specific.

268
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,020
And so the people that were successful, they also found had similar things in common.

269
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,240
And they started grouping this into a study, a statistical science.

270
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,500
All right. So what's more important is there's a wheel, the five or the nine star

271
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,900
key, the various elements.

272
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,320
Give me an example. Like I'm the element that I am is earth.

273
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,460
And there's a wheel where earth is.

274
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,960
It goes fire, earth, metal, water, wood.

275
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,540
Right. And back around.

276
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,720
So when you go in one direction, one element feeds the other.

277
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,260
And across other elements, if you go backwards, destroy.

278
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,500
One destroys the other. Right.

279
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,340
Right. If you go backwards.

280
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,860
Right. So like, right.

281
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,260
OK. So and then they go across.

282
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,100
I give you an example. The wife is a tree or wood.

283
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,120
And I'm earth. So I feed the tree requires that I feed her, build her.

284
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,900
But she breaks me. Right.

285
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,220
The roots go through it. Right. So.

286
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,600
Right. The roots. So you can dig in the earth.

287
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,660
So it's not a good. OK.

288
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,300
It is to nine star key that would not be considered mutually.

289
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,400
Mutually beneficial. Right.

290
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,800
Mutually, but not beneficial for one, not the other.

291
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,660
In one direction, it works in the direction it does not.

292
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,380
Because, yeah, OK, gotcha. Right.

293
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,140
See, the tree roots break the earth. Right. OK.

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
And then you get more specific.

295
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,780
Are you black earth? You know, black soil, yellow soil, brown soil.

296
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,480
OK, so then if you there's a later on, I'll post it in the chat.

297
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,600
And that is a very simple, comprehensive wheel to look at.

298
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,800
Right. And that is significant.

299
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,080
The type of soil it is, because, look, different types of soil are good

300
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,300
for different things. Some things are well for you.

301
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Go ahead. Well, the important this would be in your young.

302
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,720
So the light colored soils are more young and the dark colored soils are more yin.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,140
OK. Right. OK.

304
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,880
So that's why I like what color is really good.

305
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,020
Topsoil, black, black, black coffee grinds almost.

306
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Right. Use coffee grounds. Right. OK.

307
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,940
So and light colored soil is usually considered star.

308
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,180
You know, you can't grow anything.

309
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Maybe, you know, maybe sweet potatoes, red fruit or sandy.

310
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,460
Sand or sandy soil.

311
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,700
OK, so nine star key.

312
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,560
Start off with that.

313
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,580
And then you get into other aspects that nine star key will introduce you.

314
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,300
This is not horoscopes, by the way.

315
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,280
It's horoscopes is like, oh, my gosh, the Mickey Mouse version of it.

316
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Horoscopes came about not even a few hundred, not even.

317
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,320
I don't even think it was 100 years ago, the way we use them now.

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,340
But it's a Greek invention.

319
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,340
Yeah, it's no, it's less than 100 years ago, the way that they use them now.

320
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,820
The truth is, and also this is none of the star horoscopes horoscopes, by the way,

321
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,760
the way they exist currently are almost like the three little pigs version

322
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,180
of trying to teach morality. Right.

323
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,860
Where it's it's like it's one of those things

324
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,780
where they boiled it down to a children's story.

325
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,440
And here you go. There's your there's your lesson.

326
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,920
So you could take something out.

327
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,280
By the way, you can't teach morality.

328
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,540
You can only make people aware of it.

329
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,360
We're going to get into that to understand.

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,980
But the purpose is supposed to be a morality lesson. Right.

331
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,480
You know, if you learn this, then what does it tell you?

332
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,960
Make sure you're careful with strangers.

333
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,040
You know, whatever. OK.

334
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,560
But that's the thing.

335
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,760
It's it's this convoluted way of teaching a lesson

336
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,280
that doesn't actually get to the root of the thing or to a scientific basis.

337
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,600
Yeah. What's the one where there are tales where if you do this,

338
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,000
you become something bad?

339
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,960
I forgot there's a term for that.

340
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,480
Those tales. Oh, Aesop's Fables.

341
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,700
No, no. Actually, most young people have never heard of Aesop's Fables.

342
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,200
Those are actually good little lessons.

343
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,760
But there's another cautious, cautious tales are cautious.

344
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. All right.

345
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,780
Yeah. Don't you know, don't if you make a funny face, it might stay that way.

346
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,420
A cautionary tale mixed with cautionary tale.

347
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,900
Thank you. Yeah, it's different. Right.

348
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,380
Gotcha. OK. Morality could go down that road because, in other words,

349
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,320
people that had immoral thoughts where it would punish themselves,

350
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,220
like cut off their genitalia and all that.

351
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,640
You know, you've heard of stories like that and stuff like that where they.

352
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,780
Yeah, very, very Christian.

353
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,500
You know, if you think terrible, they got their eyes right.

354
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,120
If you think terrible things about other people,

355
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,660
terrible things are going to come to you because blah, blah, blah.

356
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,680
And they attach that to karma, which is another bastardization.

357
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,980
Yeah, that's that's the that's the you do stuff like that.

358
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
And you end up with what you got today. Right.

359
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,540
Well, that's that's what I'm saying, is that when you when you work

360
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,500
with convoluted to begin with, you're going to end up with convoluted at the end.

361
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,180
Yeah, it's a it's a control mechanism.

362
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
But it's psychology.

363
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,520
I took it once in a college course and they handed out the issue.

364
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,980
The professor asked for everyone's specifics.

365
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,180
And she's she put it at the beginning of the next class.

366
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,740
She went through all the sheets, everybody's name

367
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,880
and handed each one a very specific horoscope.

368
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,839
Right. It was specifically done for us.

369
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,880
And I read it, read it.

370
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,640
Who feels like it pertains to them?

371
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,560
Everybody raised their hand.

372
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,380
OK, now I want you to exchange whoever you're sitting next to.

373
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,860
It was everybody got the same thing.

374
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,320
Right. So that's what I mean.

375
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,640
That's exactly like the thing.

376
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,900
Not to mention names like Cliff High, but people that sound smart who are not.

377
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,840
Sorry. Right.

378
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,540
Please don't send me links to the clinic.

379
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
Hi, anybody, please.

380
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,860
I'm just laughing because it's like the second time.

381
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah, maybe the fifth time.

382
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,820
So it's not enough to disparage him.

383
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,520
I don't know the guy.

384
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,060
But to tell people, please don't, you know, don't fall for it.

385
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,380
If you fall for that, please.

386
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,980
You're not going to understand anything I'm saying because there's no substance there.

387
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,580
And there's no point in disparaging, you know, an idiot.

388
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,160
No, I don't know.

389
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,080
I mean, I might say that I might see a man who might have,

390
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,780
you know, hang out a bar and have a good time.

391
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,840
Listen, I can shoot pool with with the worst people on the planet

392
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,700
and have a really great time because it's fun to shoot pool.

393
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,620
No, not even. I wouldn't even go that far.

394
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,420
I don't think you would be there.

395
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm just saying to don't.

396
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,920
Well, you could say that I'm not getting it.

397
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,040
You're not getting where I'm going.

398
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,320
I mean, it's like, oh, my gosh.

399
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,380
But thanks for the thanks for the whatever subscription a month.

400
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,980
You know, whatever.

401
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,120
Thank you for supporting me that way.

402
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,640
But please listen.

403
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,600
Anyway, that's another thing I want to lead into before PhDs

404
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
and graduate study people, right?

405
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,000
They have learning problems, right?

406
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,100
Because the material they put in front of you and all academia is contradictory.

407
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,020
So if you say you've gotten one of these degrees here, you have a learning problem,

408
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,900
dude, because you're not paying attention to what you're, quote, unquote, learning

409
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,680
because all that stuff is contradictory.

410
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,160
And some of the stuff that the academia puts out in every field is just downright

411
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,780
alarming. How can you say this on this chapter

412
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,720
and then say that on the next chapter?

413
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,200
The what?

414
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,900
And any field, any field, medical, science, political, anything.

415
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,740
It's like, oh, you got learning problems if you went beyond the eighth grade,

416
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,460
by the way, and believed any of it.

417
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,420
Now, I'm not saying that you can't learn stuff.

418
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,740
Look, when I was in school, I went to a technical school.

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,920
You had to you had to test to get in.

420
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,720
And that was the time when the T.I.

421
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,460
Texas T.I.

422
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,240
90 or something was the first scientific calculator come out on the market,

423
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,160
which is one hundred and twenty five bucks back in 1980.

424
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,160
Right. Today's money.

425
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,340
That would be like a four hundred dollar calculator, right?

426
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
Five hundred, maybe more.

427
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,080
That's when Texas instruments dominated the market.

428
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,240
Yeah, that's when it first came out.

429
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,180
We're supposed to get that.

430
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,540
But when I got into technical school, we're using slide rules

431
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,940
and we're transitioning.

432
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,020
What the hell is a slide rule to paint stirrer?

433
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,580
Right. Was that it?

434
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,540
That's a funky looking paint stirrer. Right.

435
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,980
You know. So anyway, I use this, you know, give a slide rule

436
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,240
to someone under 30 and videotape it.

437
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,480
It'd be funnier than a monkey trying to fuck a football. Right.

438
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,700
But anyway, a slide rule and an abacus.

439
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,260
I mean, they think, oh, what do you give me? Baby toys. OK.

440
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,420
No, actually not. But yeah.

441
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,460
Anyway. So yeah. So so the technical aspects.

442
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,220
Yes. But then the technical aspects are so linear, put you in a box.

443
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,140
That's why everyone's trying to think out of the box

444
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,280
because they put you in a box. No one put you in a box.

445
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,660
I mean, no one puts themselves in a box.

446
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,260
You've been put in a box.

447
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,080
That's why everyone says you got to think outside of the box.

448
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,820
Why don't you just walk out of the box? Just put it in its place.

449
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Put your education where you think it should be

450
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,520
and then find out where it really should be and then mitigate it. Right.

451
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,320
Because some people let me say that again.

452
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,780
Put your education where you think it should be

453
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,480
and then find out where it really should be.

454
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,420
The big difference.

455
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,340
Because some people hang everything on what they think it is.

456
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,980
And it's really not that at all. Right. It's a rite of passage.

457
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,560
It's a fool's game. It's this and that. So anyway.

458
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,020
So let's get into a little more of the nine star key.

459
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,860
Let's not actually let's just we just introduced this. Right.

460
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,120
Yeah. Well, so still we're looking at now.

461
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,480
Key. Now, look, key to me is if you think about it.

462
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,700
Yeah. Well, I was just going to go back to a martial arts class.

463
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,620
You know, when I was a kid,

464
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,820
you know, the idea is that your key was it was about your energetic.

465
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,940
You're you're you're sourcing your energy, right?

466
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,580
You're you're you're gathering it together and you're focusing energy.

467
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,080
That was your key when it came to martial arts.

468
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,600
So it doesn't have anything to do with that sort of thinking where it's.

469
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,120
Yeah, it's a trauma in India.

470
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,920
Like, for example, if if I were doing a presentation

471
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,640
with weather devices in front of people in Bangladesh,

472
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,760
I would show the device and say this is a device to guide Prana

473
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,140
and they would understand completely everything that else

474
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,600
I have to say and how it functions and what's its intent is. Right.

475
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,460
Or if I went to do a presentation on weather devices

476
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,820
in Japan or China and Japan, I would say this is a key device.

477
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,460
Or in China, the same term is Chi.

478
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,560
This is to channel Chi and everyone would know exactly what the intent is.

479
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,600
No problem. Right.

480
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,160
Now, here you would say energy, but that's really still up for grabs

481
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,080
because energy, they think the socket in the wall, which is,

482
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,920
you know, pressurized magnetic electricity. No, not that.

483
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,040
Anyway, the nine star key is based on study.

484
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,300
It's not. Don't confuse it with the horoscope garbage at all.

485
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,940
Now, I'm not saying it's, you know, rock solid.

486
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,900
I wouldn't really lean on it too much.

487
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,900
You could lean on it enough to see if it works for you,

488
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,360
because it is information to work with.

489
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,720
Now, an easy way to figure out what you are.

490
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,700
There's many ways you add up the if you were born between 1902 and 2001.

491
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,900
All you got to do is take the last two numbers of the year

492
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,520
and add them together and subtract it from 11. That's your number.

493
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,480
So if you're born in 63,

494
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,560
six and three is nine minus 11 is two.

495
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,460
So you're number two.

496
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,900
All right. There's other formulas.

497
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,260
There's charts. You can look it up online.

498
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,400
Some of the conflict, some of them are conflicting because, OK,

499
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,640
once you find the year that you were born, then you got to find out the month.

500
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,920
By the way, nine star key, the month starts in February.

501
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,240
The year starts around February.

502
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,200
So if you're born in January, it's the year before.

503
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,660
So if you're born in January of 1963.

504
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,360
Well, let's do mine. Let's do mine real quick.

505
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,120
OK, so I'm born. OK, well, I'm not I'm not in front of a computer.

506
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,720
So go ahead. Well, I'll do my best.

507
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,140
Yeah, no, I think you'll be fine without the computer.

508
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,560
So I'm born in 1972.

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,060
So I take the last two numbers, which is the seven and a two.

510
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,900
I've got a nine.

511
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,500
I take that nine and I subtract it from 11.

512
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,100
It's a two and it's a two. All right.

513
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,520
So what does that mean?

514
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,500
But but you were what month were you born?

515
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,260
Oh, sorry. April.

516
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,000
All right. Well, that's in that year.

517
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,560
But if you were born in January, you'd be counted as the year before.

518
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,400
Seventy one, right?

519
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,220
Well, yeah, because the year doesn't begin to February.

520
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
So if it was January, then we start with seven.

521
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,580
Now, some computers are different.

522
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,960
Like, OK, OK, let me just continue on the thought.

523
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,860
Yeah. Then you have the month number and the week month and day number,

524
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,940
which actually shows your tendencies up until you're mature.

525
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,340
So it's so much more complicated.

526
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,680
This can be perceptively to Western to the horoscope.

527
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,700
You have to also find what month and day you were born

528
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
or what part of the month.

529
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,000
Right. First half less.

530
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,820
And then that shows you how you what your tendencies were

531
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,880
up until your 18, 19, 20th year.

532
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
And then it shows how you can revert back to those years.

533
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,080
Right. It gets a little more.

534
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,920
Well, we'll explain.

535
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,160
It's like, you know, this union young and health.

536
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,840
I've been getting into it.

537
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,400
You can't just do that in 15 minutes.

538
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,360
No, no, not at all.

539
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,080
But, you know, what's funny is that you're describing part of the process

540
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,960
that people do these personalized charts with actually sometimes not the

541
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,940
not the crazy one, like you said, where they did it among the whole class.

542
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,380
And oh, no, I know what you're saying.

543
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,400
Those are the ones. Yeah.

544
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,040
But those are still just based on where the stars are.

545
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,240
Most has nothing to do with that at all.

546
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,940
This has to do with studies that have been done with boots on the ground,

547
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,300
taking notes of people for thousands of years.

548
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,140
These are records.

549
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,860
It is, by the way, it is based on stereotypes.

550
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,020
And these are more anthropological.

551
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,620
Yeah, but we got into what a stereotype actually is.

552
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,940
A couple of sonics ago. Right.

553
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,360
So this is based on stereotypes.

554
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,800
So if you don't like stereotypes and music like that, you got to go somewhere else.

555
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,500
Right. Got you.

556
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,460
With a set of nine star kids based on stereotypes.

557
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,700
Stereotypes are used in cartoons when you see the the block face,

558
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,300
the block head with the brow bone, with the the gray shade and the cartoon.

559
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,860
That's usually a thug or a criminal in the cartoon, right?

560
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,540
Oh, yeah, of course.

561
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,960
When they show a vertical, narrow face with glasses, that's usually the professor.

562
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,820
But you're right.

563
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,080
And they put the five o'clock shadow on the guy who was.

564
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,560
Yeah, it was kind of the dog.

565
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,620
Yeah. Yeah.

566
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
But he's not a smart thug.

567
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
He's the there.

568
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,880
And most of the people that do look like that are not that smart.

569
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,420
That's true.

570
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,840
You know, like strong, like both smart, like Gorilla.

571
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,020
OK, so. All right.

572
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,560
So anyway.

573
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,820
We're bringing a little Russian flavor tonight.

574
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,960
Why not? I guess.

575
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,120
Yeah, that's more of the north north

576
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
western part of Russia.

577
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,760
But cool. OK, so anyway.

578
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,160
So I start to look into it.

579
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,240
We'll get into it further if there's any more requests.

580
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,680
Some of you might know about it already.

581
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,160
I know some of you do from based on your backgrounds.

582
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Let's continue.

583
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,160
Fongsoi, Fongsoi, Fongsoi, Fongsoi, right.

584
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,820
What's a funky way?

585
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,220
I heard it once said it was really funny.

586
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,180
Oh, Fongsoi is the text.

587
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,580
OK, Fongsoi. Yeah.

588
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,760
So anyway, Hong Kong, what that is, that is also energy movement.

589
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,220
Right. Like very simple.

590
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,000
You know, energy movement that you that everyone knows,

591
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,380
like if you walk into a house that doesn't feel welcoming.

592
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,900
Right. Whether you're when you're inside,

593
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,440
it's probably because the entrance door is in the middle of the house.

594
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,340
Right. That's why you build vestibules.

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,100
A lot of it is very commonly understood intuitively by human.

596
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,200
Should I say nature?

597
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,680
Well, and some of these things are developed structurally

598
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,880
due to the fact that they're more practical.

599
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,400
Right. I mean, look, the fact is that when you have a you have a chest of drawers

600
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,160
or you have a piece of furniture with drawers that come out,

601
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,720
it is wise to give enough space in between that and the next object.

602
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,200
Yeah. And also, you know, things like bathroom locations,

603
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,860
things that make smells.

604
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,660
So we can get into that.

605
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,560
But let's let's let's do let's, you know, remember the thing.

606
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
If we run out of time, give the most important stuff.

607
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,760
Some things are mechanically significant, though,

608
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,920
and therefore make more sense, you know, to have doors swing.

609
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,020
Yeah. Every culture uses it.

610
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,440
Actually, there's a lot of Fongsoi built into.

611
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,100
I use the Chinese way of saying Fongsoi

612
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,600
or Geomancy, which is measuring the earth,

613
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,780
is used in many of the codes, by the way, you know, the building codes anyway.

614
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,520
Well, I was just thinking of building codes, because if you take a look at,

615
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,540
you know, the way places are built based on different time periods,

616
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,380
you can see that some of them are more adapting to the environment,

617
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,900
whereas others really take hold of the environment and sort of redo it.

618
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,060
And others will create an entirely artificial situation.

619
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,420
Again, thinking about the different types of earth that one could place.

620
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,040
But it's also power structure.

621
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,700
So let's get the most important part first, you know.

622
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,120
All right. Give me more advance, because I studied this back in the 80s

623
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,340
when it was just beginning popular.

624
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
It was more for the rich folk, right?

625
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,100
When it was really deeply trendy for those who really wanted to spend money

626
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,660
and somebody would pay a couple of grand for somebody to come in

627
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,920
and rearrange their living rooms.

628
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,480
Believe it or not, that was a real thing.

629
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,180
So go ahead. Yeah.

630
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,880
Capitals, important cities, important corporate buildings.

631
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,180
They hire geomancers, which is someone who practices feng shui.

632
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,680
Well, there they want to set up their waiting rooms.

633
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,140
And, you know, their lobby area is on the map, right?

634
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,540
So you always want mountains to the north of you, a lake or a body of water

635
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,860
to the south. Right.

636
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
The west is your main entry and egress, your highway and roads.

637
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,060
And on the east is a river.

638
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,840
That's your typical setup.

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,520
You'll see Tokyo, major cities in Asia always set up.

640
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,640
Right. And that's the way that they develop, you know, say the way

641
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,120
they're going to lay out the buildings, the actual engineering of that.

642
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
Right. The way that they're going.

643
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,820
Well, that was the layout of the city.

644
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,720
Then the building would be something.

645
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,400
Let's just take something very common.

646
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,200
Like you don't want bedrooms facing the east because.

647
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,460
Right. You're going to be waking up with the sun or you need some heavy shades.

648
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,520
Right. That's very common.

649
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,180
You're going to get the sun pounding down again.

650
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,600
Common. Here we go.

651
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,640
And you don't want them really on the west because you're going to get the

652
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,300
they're going to get heated or you might have them on the northwest.

653
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,860
That's the most power position.

654
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,940
So we can get into that.

655
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,620
But these are practical considerations again.

656
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,960
Right. You know, just like before we transition.

657
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,320
Yeah. You make a bed of certain details.

658
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,560
You make a big of the.

659
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,320
So let me. All right.

660
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,800
I was just trying to say you make a bed a certain height in order that

661
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,880
you have a certain quality of air at a certain level

662
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,080
and a certain quality of air at another level.

663
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,840
You know, well, that yin and yang again, yin and yang.

664
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,500
So someone who's very yin.

665
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,860
Right. Right.

666
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,020
Would need a young bed to balance them out.

667
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,780
So young bed would be very high. Right.

668
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,400
Someone who is very young.

669
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,480
You would want a low bed to balance them out.

670
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,000
So generally, like people in Japan are far more young than people in Western.

671
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,660
Where do they sleep on the floor?

672
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,440
And that's why they also sit on the floor.

673
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,080
We and if you go to places where people are very, very yin.

674
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,900
In the tropics, you sleep high up in a like in a hammock or, you know,

675
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,360
yeah, and you might say it's to keep the bugs away or whatever,

676
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,100
but they just find natural comfort zones.

677
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,940
So here. Yeah. The front of the body is young.

678
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,860
The back is yin.

679
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,040
So where does the young energy on the body run up the back?

680
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,080
The yin side.

681
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,080
And where does the yin energy run down the front?

682
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,460
So if you tell someone Western thinking doesn't understand

683
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,520
yin and yang at the front of the body is young and the back is yin.

684
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,920
They're going to approach it like the battery.

685
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Right. Positive with positive. Negative with negative.

686
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,360
Right. When you hook up a battery.

687
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,720
No, the front of the body is young.

688
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,040
So they're going to tell you the young energy runs up the front.

689
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,020
No, it runs up the back, the inside.

690
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,120
So you always got to remember that throughout that flip the antagonisms.

691
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,460
Well, just just like the look of the black and white symbol is that you got to see

692
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,800
that the curve flows against the other curve exactly the same.

693
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,100
No, that's not where I'm going at.

694
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,460
You got to look at the flip.

695
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,360
You got not the black and white simple symbol, but like the black and white tile

696
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,580
that the Freemasons like.

697
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,680
OK, every every black tile is surrounded with white tile

698
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,200
and every white tile is surrounded with black tile.

699
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,020
Think about it. Think about a black checkerboard, white checkerboard,

700
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,300
black and white checkerboard.

701
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,260
You notice that every white tile

702
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,200
only on its corners does it see another white tile,

703
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,120
but its main line see the opposite color. Right.

704
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,640
That's the yin and yang symbol.

705
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,740
By the way, Western interpretation is trying to communicate something.

706
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
So again, the checkerboard.

707
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,540
Yes. In other words, they have things that shouldn't be secret.

708
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,800
That's why they keep them secret.

709
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,160
That's what right. You see how it works anyway.

710
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,880
We need to get into more of the methodology, which is what the part

711
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
that you don't want to hear.

712
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,600
Let me let me. But let me.

713
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,200
All right. This is the third time I'm doing it.

714
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,900
Third time you're coming up to the cliff and not getting there. Right.

715
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,160
Yeah. This is I want to give how esoteric this can get.

716
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,120
The this is the end.

717
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,860
Like, let's say we did four sonics on four sonics and each one progressed,

718
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,940
you know, from kindergarten, grade school, high school, graduate level.

719
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,220
Let's just give the end of the graduate class right now.

720
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,740
This is the spot in the cell phone conversation where you get.

721
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,280
Yeah, you get the most important.

722
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
It's actually the least important if you don't get it.

723
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,360
But I'll give it in a way that hopefully you can get it,

724
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
because I've been told I can communicate these things well.

725
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,100
So let's give it a try. Cool.

726
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,620
OK, one guy was.

727
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,320
Why, gentlemen, sir, this is in the 70s.

728
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,300
He was consulting his father, consulted with this father of this family.

729
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,760
It was multi generational.

730
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,800
So this multi generational wealthy family had a multi generational geomancers.

731
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,100
So they all knew each other very well or whatever.

732
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,280
And they had a duty. Right.

733
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,040
So they he watched this one's family wealth go down and down and down.

734
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,480
And they they tried him.

735
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,300
He couldn't figure it out at the time.

736
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,700
And they hired other geomancers.

737
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,620
They couldn't do better.

738
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,640
So he finally resulted to say,

739
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,620
because this is sympathetic magic in a way. Right.

740
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,180
Because we've tried everything except for the ancestral worship,

741
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,560
respecting your ancestors, we're going to try that now. OK.

742
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,660
So what he did was he imagined that the family being powerful

743
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,660
and wealthy had powerful, wealthy enemies that hired a smart geomancer

744
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,980
to do something to hex the family.

745
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,280
And they tried to mitigate it every way and didn't work.

746
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,280
So he says, ah, one thing we didn't try.

747
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:18,800
Is that let's suppose the enemies of this family hired a geomancer, right, to

748
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,679
do something to hurt the graves of where the ancestors were buried.

749
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
And because of that object

750
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,560
that is putting that negative energy towards their graves,

751
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,620
they're experiencing financial misfortune.

752
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,560
So he said, let's say

753
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,000
that what they did was they took a statue of the antagonist,

754
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,260
took a statue of an archer, a small statue.

755
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,020
It doesn't matter if it's 10 feet tall or or a one inch tall statue

756
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,380
and found out where these ancestors were buried.

757
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,820
And he placed that statue with the archer drawing the bow opposite the graves.

758
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,000
So the energy of an archer drawing his bow in full tension

759
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,900
before release, pointing at the graves is what's causing their misfortune.

760
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,960
Did he imagine?

761
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,920
So let's mitigate that. How would we mitigate it?

762
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,420
We're going to go and get lots of little statuettes of rabbits

763
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,500
and place them all around the grave

764
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,940
in a way that people don't have to see the statues.

765
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,980
Could be 10 feet tall or half an inch tall.

766
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,360
They could be the size of army men.

767
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,860
You're even smaller.

768
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,980
It could be microscopic.

769
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,220
OK, point. Right.

770
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,820
It's because it's sympathetic magic.

771
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,100
Well, what the when they placed like the Otis's rabbit doesn't matter, right?

772
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,420
Yes. Yeah. Well, in this case, no, it is sympathetic magic.

773
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,480
When they placed these statues

774
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,700
almost immediately within days, the fortune started recovering

775
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,480
and they grew and grew and grew.

776
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,800
Now, is this simply because they're given the rabbits?

777
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,900
You know, the rabbits are now the reason for the OK.

778
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,380
The reason his logic was about putting the rabbits around the graves

779
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,360
was now that the archers arrow would hit the rabbit

780
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,220
instead of the grave of the ancestors.

781
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,260
Well, let me just say as a target, not not not.

782
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,000
No, wait, hold on. As it turns out, it didn't have to be a rabbit.

783
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,540
Any other prey animal would have been fine.

784
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,260
Game animal would have been fine.

785
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,340
It could have been antelope or whatever.

786
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,940
But basically, well, I think the rabbit was to symbolize the prey

787
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,580
to take the arrow away. Right.

788
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,440
Well, I think I have another question here, like as opposed to giving

789
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,340
the archers another target.

790
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,420
What about putting a wall around the ancestors grave

791
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,460
so that there is something that the archers cannot penetrate?

792
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,620
Right. Put a put a dome over.

793
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,260
Yeah, you could do that, but I wouldn't do that.

794
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,040
You wouldn't. I would fire you and hire someone who had a different

795
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,540
different solution because a wall is an obstruction.

796
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,780
Remember? Well, yeah, of course, it's an obstruction.

797
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,880
But the thing is, if you direct the obstruction, now you have your your choices

798
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,580
as to where there is an ability where it would deflect.

799
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,400
The arrow could bounce off the wall and hit someone else's grave.

800
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,420
Well, this is true.

801
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,100
But you want to use a but no one really aims.

802
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,620
And it also has to make sense in sympathetic magic.

803
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,440
No one aims an arrow at a wall.

804
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,100
You might aim the arrow at someone on over a wall or at.

805
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,780
But we still need something to aim at.

806
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,300
It has to be in accordance with the way that things are living.

807
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,460
Not you see, not body armor because body armor is not living. Right.

808
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,800
Right. No one aims.

809
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,900
People wear body armor, but no one aims at the body armor.

810
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,260
As a matter of fact, you want to hit them where they don't have body armor.

811
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,020
Well, right. Of course, somebody's got to confess.

812
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,920
So anyway, this is the this is an example of how esoteric it can get.

813
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,760
OK. All right. Now, rearranging furniture in this sense.

814
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,500
OK, the question that's answered there is that if the most basic instruction

815
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,780
let's go back to what I said earlier, that academics have people with PhDs,

816
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,300
doctorates, master's degree, even bachelor's degree,

817
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,200
they have those people that tout that they have those degrees.

818
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,480
Right. They have learning problems

819
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,860
because, OK, there's a difference between learning. OK.

820
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,540
You. A more accurate way to say something

821
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,560
is to you are familiar with something.

822
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,900
You can accommodate a thought or a subject

823
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,180
based on being familiar, right, or being acquainted.

824
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,280
Right. And that's called learning.

825
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,760
Right. You really can't learn because, OK,

826
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,640
when you have learned in something, you are acquainted with the subject.

827
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
You're familiar with the subject.

828
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,200
You can discuss the subject.

829
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,420
You have working ability and talent in that subject. Right.

830
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,580
Right. So you called your learned in that subject because of those other traits.

831
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,640
So what they call learning in these academic

832
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,480
this has been going on for a long time is memorization.

833
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,360
So on one page of a textbook, they'll give a whatever.

834
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,960
And then on the next textbook, it's totally contrary.

835
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,420
But if you memorize the two contrary things and repeat them, they'll give you an A.

836
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,300
It's called regurgitation. Yeah.

837
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,760
But if you are a comedy, if you are becoming familiar,

838
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,280
acquainted and knowing of the subject and using reason,

839
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,120
you'll say, wait a second, the stuff you want me to learn

840
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,460
ain't worth learning because it's contradictory.

841
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,920
So the people with these degrees are learned because they memorize,

842
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,780
not because they're familiar with the subject.

843
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,840
Here, perfect example.

844
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,780
Try to have a conversation with anyone with a graduate degree

845
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,820
about any subject. They cannot hold it very long.

846
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,480
After about a minute or two or three or four,

847
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,820
they're going to sound like they're speaking from memorization

848
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,620
and they cannot take questions that they have never heard before ever.

849
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,040
This happens every time.

850
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,200
These are the ones that believe in that they they've learned something there.

851
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,140
Right. Get it right. It's very easy.

852
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,700
I don't need to give any examples at this point.

853
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,280
If you're listening to Greek speak.

854
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,380
Exactly. And I've spoken to plenty of historians.

855
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,320
And you can, you know, definitely get a sense of what it is they've memorized.

856
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,080
But they have no clue.

857
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,440
Majority of them, any which way to study it.

858
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,920
Like if you give them a historical subject, OK, let's just say

859
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
they're all about the 20th century.

860
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,000
OK, fine. They got plenty of memorization there for you.

861
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,200
But you say, OK, well, you're a historian, correct? All right.

862
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,860
So what about the historical?

863
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,720
And you take them just a century or two in another direction.

864
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,320
They can't even begin to reason because.

865
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,300
Well, no. Well, yeah, because this is OK.

866
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,180
But like if 80 percent or 90 percent of the casualties of World War

867
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,320
II were civilians,

868
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,640
the military is not that bad that they can miss their target that bad.

869
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,160
So the purpose of World War II is to kill civilians.

870
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,760
I mean, you might have some people that are bad shots,

871
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,520
but not for four years consistently. Right.

872
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,160
They're not with 40 million, 50 million, really 100 million people.

873
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,900
Well, that's always so they can't come out and say

874
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,580
World War II in summary was to get us rid of civilians,

875
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,000
even though they know 90 percent of the casualties were civilians.

876
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,800
They just say, oh, was this battle, this ally, that bullshit.

877
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,200
No, but they'll just fire it back at you that, no, that is not the purpose of

878
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,080
because they're just repeating the corporate line.

879
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,880
And why is there three banks that supplied everyone with the credit that they needed?

880
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,680
No, that's not right, because they're not looking at the actual

881
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,760
because they're not objectively examining the situation and saying, well,

882
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,840
if you have this consistent,

883
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,980
you know, achievement here, that obviously is the

884
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,300
desired result that you're reaching for.

885
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,340
Yeah, but it's any subject.

886
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,040
How can they show you the lumina cross section of the intestine and anatomy

887
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,440
and then tell you that you're absorbing?

888
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,280
And by the way, in medical, what they're doing is they're forcing you now

889
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,980
to memorize all these chemical reactions in the cells, which are totally.

890
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,740
I see this textbook, $400 textbook, all about these chemical reactions in cells.

891
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,400
And I'm like, how did they find out what chemical is in the cell?

892
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,960
They they they they crush it, centrifuge it and then burn it. Right.

893
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,680
This doesn't even resemble it.

894
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,980
No, because what does that have to do with any of the stuff that's

895
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,560
that that shows you nothing about what it's like if I have a Webster's

896
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,060
dictionary and I and I should put it in the shredder and then burn it and analyze it.

897
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,540
It's it's so far from Webster's dictionary.

898
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,900
I could do that with anything.

899
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,540
If you want to eat your dictionary, you can.

900
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,060
It doesn't mean you picked up any of the words from eating it.

901
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,840
OK, it's just that's what they believe you can.

902
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,960
But here's the thing.

903
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,940
How can they show you that you have?

904
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,240
Where's the what's the people talk to me about even recently

905
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,620
about diseases and nutrition, like what's the mechanism for that?

906
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,300
Well, you absorb these vitamins.

907
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,520
What's the just a simple what's the mechanism for absorption?

908
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,780
But, you know, they studied this is what that was taught.

909
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,640
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not asking you to.

910
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,300
I know you were taught. What's the like?

911
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,580
You're right. I don't know what the mechanism is for the.

912
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,920
You see, it's like, oh, my gosh, you should have asked that while you're in class.

913
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,800
Yeah. And you know, but no, you're too busy memorizing because here's the thing.

914
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Again, when you take a look at the medical industry.

915
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,640
Right. And you say, well, look, how many people did they cure

916
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,040
and how many people did they kill?

917
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,240
Now, if you see consistently that they're taking something like medication

918
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,640
and constantly killing people with it, you kind of start to say to yourself,

919
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,240
well, it appears as though it works out.

920
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,560
But hold on. It's that's outside of the medical industry.

921
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,540
OK, for example, you like attorneys don't know any law.

922
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,560
Judges don't know any law. They tell you that.

923
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,600
By the way, I've seen in a federal courtroom was a financial thing.

924
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,700
What person brought up the law?

925
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,860
And the judge got very upset that the defendant said, you cannot bring law

926
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
into this courtroom.

927
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm like, whoa, you know, this is exactly right.

928
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,740
So it doesn't matter.

929
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,620
But, you know, OK, look, it's interesting.

930
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,300
Yeah. Yeah. You can see this repeat.

931
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,700
No, it's what's what's going on is what's socially accepted.

932
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,000
Right. And so it's social rank.

933
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,480
OK, let's get into the part people don't want to hear.

934
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,380
Yes. Dimensional, dimensional thinking and all that.

935
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,280
OK, first of all, the problem word there is thinking.

936
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,280
First of all, when that term comes up, you are presuming

937
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,340
person can't think.

938
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,200
We described a few mechanisms here tonight

939
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,900
indirectly that refer to this. Right.

940
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,540
Second thing is, does the person want to?

941
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,860
Now, there's a difference between someone saying they want to

942
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,000
and really wanting to. Right.

943
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,920
OK. Now, the other part is

944
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,900
when you see there's something lacking in someone

945
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,940
within two minutes, if you don't see any progress

946
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,640
and I'm not talking about a baby that's still crawling

947
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,840
and hasn't woken an adult, you're probably not going to get any.

948
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,340
Sorry at all.

949
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,180
So what you do, because you can do it,

950
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,240
you step in and that's your job when you're around that person,

951
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,500
almost as if to the point you're around a handicapped person.

952
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,080
You actually view them not being able to know as a handicap,

953
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,060
like someone in a wheelchair can't reach something.

954
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,040
You don't figure out how to get them out of the wheelchair at the moment.

955
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,860
You reach and accommodate their condition.

956
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,820
So right now, this is right now, meaning this year,

957
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,520
last year, the past 50 years and probably the next 10 years.

958
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,180
The situation humanity is in, we have to accommodate each other.

959
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,700
If someone doesn't get anything or something, leave it alone.

960
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,640
If you get it, it's a blessing because there's someone in the room.

961
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,380
I can figure it out.

962
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,860
But teaching other people at this point, quote unquote,

963
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,060
I'm using the term loosely if they are exposed to it.

964
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,900
And if a hint is brought up and a very small edifying comment

965
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,400
does not show result within two minutes, two minutes and 30 seconds,

966
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,740
leave it alone. Drop it.

967
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,360
Forget it. Because you are bringing up the question,

968
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,480
how do you show someone this type of thinking?

969
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,900
It's OK. So just simply how would you do it?

970
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,620
There is no magic way to teach anything.

971
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,380
It's the only thing I could say.

972
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,360
And now that we're looking for magic and bring up the concept,

973
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,520
try to be a good communicator, communicate your thought clearly,

974
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,380
concisely, simply as if, you know, not juvenile, but childlike.

975
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
There's a difference between juvenile and childlike.

976
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,940
Childlike means simple and gentle.

977
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,980
Juvenile means simple and gentle, but so narrow and inexperienced.

978
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,360
Try to bring whatever you can.

979
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,080
If the person cannot grasp it at the moment, they probably won't.

980
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,000
That now it might seem like they are 20 years later, five years later,

981
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,060
but they still won't.

982
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,700
This is the sad part about understanding humanity.

983
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,380
Now, this is another aspect I want to throw in.

984
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,580
Recently, I've been looking at, not studying, looking at the work of John Mace.

985
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,660
Mace, just like the mace, the spray mace that you spray pepper spray,

986
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,000
Mace, M-A-C-E, psychology.

987
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,900
Basically, it's very, very much like Greek speak.

988
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,300
But I like how, you know, very often I say you could do things very rapidly.

989
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,300
This is all tied together, by the way, it's not a tangent.

990
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,860
He basically can help people psychologically

991
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,180
with people like rape victims and how to whatever.

992
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:25,240
In two sessions, almost immediately, because he says that the mind stores only images.

993
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,820
We create identity around these images and then we attach identities like that was traumatic.

994
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,280
The brain, the mind does not know is traumatic.

995
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,260
We call it traumatic.

996
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,880
So he has you recall the event.

997
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,440
You don't have to share what the event is at all.

998
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,880
He just asks you to whatever is bothering you.

999
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,420
Do you get an image and you say yes.

1000
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,200
So it basically tells you is the image getting bigger and you say, yes, yes, yes.

1001
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,920
Tell me when it stops getting bigger.

1002
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,180
And then after a while, the patient or someone will say, OK, no, not getting any bigger.

1003
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,520
How big is it? It's as big as Queen Mary is like, OK, now look at it.

1004
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,680
I want you to shrink it down to nothing. Is it shrinking?

1005
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,040
Yes, it's shrinking, shrinking down to nothing deleted.

1006
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,840
Now it's gone and the traumas go away. It's very interesting.

1007
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,420
All right. But he also states that everything is emo.

1008
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,600
Everything is emotional.

1009
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,760
Oh, my gosh. Where have you heard that before?

1010
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,040
Well, this is almost like writing something down on a piece of paper.

1011
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,200
Burn that piece of paper.

1012
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,120
Now consider that exactly. Yeah, exactly the same.

1013
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,480
But it's that's considered more sympathetic magic.

1014
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,780
But in this case, it would be representation of that.

1015
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,860
You don't even have to go that far. You have to waste paper.

1016
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,860
There's some interviews with him.

1017
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,180
John Mase, you can just search around.

1018
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,300
I don't have any access to that right now.

1019
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,200
Maybe there's people that are really good at the keyboard.

1020
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,900
You'll pull something up, look at it.

1021
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,240
They're very secretive because they're there.

1022
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,100
They're actually they think that because they have a new technique of doing

1023
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,920
something, Scalarator, that they're going to be wealthy

1024
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,980
because they have a new way that's 100 times better than normal psychology.

1025
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,520
They're going to be stupid.

1026
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,240
If you think you're going to be wealthy,

1027
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,580
if you are not part of this, then you don't. Right.

1028
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,120
OK, so example, in other words, what they're doing

1029
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,120
is holding back a lot of the critical information.

1030
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,220
But if you read the book,

1031
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,700
you'll get 90 percent or let's say 75 percent, which is enough

1032
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,640
to do the therapy they talk about.

1033
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,460
But their whole you have to pay them a whole bunch of money

1034
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,220
to get the last 10 percent or 25 percent because they think

1035
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,720
because they bested psychology, by the way, which is true.

1036
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,100
Freudian stuff is ridiculous.

1037
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:19,880
You know, Freud was

1038
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,920
recorded on saying on his way over to America

1039
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,880
that we're bringing the plague over to the to America right now.

1040
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,640
He didn't mean the playmen, you know, psychology that he does.

1041
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,720
So it's going to really screw everybody up.

1042
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,280
So anyway, the only thing that, you know, they, you know, anyway, whatever.

1043
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,600
But you'll get his it is valid.

1044
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,860
His technology is valid.

1045
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,080
Sounds a lot. If you're familiar with Greek speak, you'll get it right away.

1046
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,240
I just was made aware of him.

1047
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,240
I would suggest to the listener, actually, that you could probably find that

1048
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,900
on the Internet archive if you look in the right spots, this kind of stuff.

1049
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,280
But go ahead. Yeah.

1050
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,240
So anyway, tie that all together.

1051
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,040
Images, images, images, emo, emo, emo.

1052
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,420
You know, the structure builds that way, the structure of the mind, the learning,

1053
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,380
becoming familiar with something right that you can have a working knowledge

1054
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,360
and something we call that learned, you know, someone he's learned and whatever.

1055
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,840
It's because he's familiar with the subject is a working knowledge.

1056
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,500
Right. But what most people are

1057
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,100
that they've learned something is not learning.

1058
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,580
Just again, any academic, any subject, they have just memorized things.

1059
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,400
They cannot follow logic and reason.

1060
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,300
I speak to people who have graduate degrees in various fields,

1061
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,840
and they do get them in a personal situation, never in front of others.

1062
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,400
They will admit that everything they learned is pretty much bullshit

1063
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,540
or some of it's useful.

1064
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,380
But most of it is bullshit.

1065
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,560
But they have to retain.

1066
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,800
It's kind of like a colonel in the army.

1067
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,240
Basically, you know, you're a colonel.

1068
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,080
It doesn't mean that much other than the uniform.

1069
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,080
Yeah, I know. But don't tell him, you know, we don't want everybody to think that.

1070
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,480
Right. Because then the structure falls apart.

1071
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,620
Right. The structure is in between your ears.

1072
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,400
Everyone's here.
