1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,680
A sonic event a 79 on rated Y and here we go now a couple of contacts a couple

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,340
things happening in the chat room yes there was something mentioned regarding

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,460
the last sonic now I did take a little extra time putting it out so you'd have

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,080
to check out 78 to understand this but yeah apparently you're gonna be doing

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,200
something in the very near future Greek but how you doing I'm doing okay yeah

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,100
we're just talking about water and stuff but we'll get into water again soon I

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,580
put out there we'll be doing like a water seminar that's open to anyone by

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,880
the way people you know people you don't know it's just we're gonna do it on

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,000
Skype because I know the tech and the tech is solid more solid than zoom or

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,780
anything else I've seen Google someone did a international Google something

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,680
Google has their own version what a piece of crap oh there's terrible yeah

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,360
there's horrible yeah oh yes so Skype if you don't like it too bad but yeah it's

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,820
it because you don't recognize what's good a lot of people I know and do Skype

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,020
I'm like you're not really thinking right you don't really see what's right in

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,760
front of you do you and it's amazing when zoom came out how many people ran

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,960
to it and just Skype I was like you are not paying any attention at all

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,940
whatsoever I got your number though I see where you're at yeah you know where

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,440
the crowd runs yeah it's total garbage all the other stuff and I'm not look I

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,420
don't Skype doesn't give me anything to say that I'm just telling you so yeah

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,560
actually I mean they don't give me anything either I've been using it for I

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,980
don't even know how long is probably probably a little less less time than

22
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,580
you but still yeah it's the most reliable thing I mean what are you gonna

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,280
yeah they've tried to downscale it like nothing over 20 megabytes and this and

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,860
that for files and it's it's the bomb diggity it's the bomb diggity yeah you

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,660
know what's weird though I think they don't do that to you on Apple devices

26
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,200
oddly enough like they do that only on the devices that are native to the

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,360
company that owns it which yeah I want to get the kind of thing we were

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,480
mentioning also don't if you guys have computers with hard drives ditch it it's

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,260
like having a cassette player in your car get away from all that magnetic

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,660
SSD is the way to go and just look on Craigslist try to get a used machine I

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,840
fired up some stuff today that had a hard drive I was like even though I was

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,320
like oh my gosh because I'm just using a laptop and then the stupid rectangle

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,860
which is my seven from ten years ago now almost or eight years ago whatever yeah

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,080
what are we and 13 or 14 there or something yeah it doesn't matter to me I

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,400
mean the you know to me the operating system is the problem I think there's a

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
way to reroute or something that's called it also works more like a

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,640
computer but yeah the hard drive stuff is just silly nilly stuff it's just get

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,580
away from it if you can it's get it's lighter less electricity you know SSD

39
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,060
whatever I know it sounds snobbish but you know oh by the way back in the 1980s

40
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,680
I was at the Chicago Electronics Show when the big thing was the Philips and

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,080
the Sony CD player and I was talking to someone there and he's oh no yeah this

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,380
is all coming up but eventually it won't even have that it'll be on a chip and he

43
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,420
had a device that was the precursor to the you know the mp3 players right right

44
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,300
right this is back in the 80s so right now there's even more holographic stuff

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,440
ready to you know that's being used and I don't think society society at large

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,280
is going to get it might be into that but anyway yeah get away from it a

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,180
spinning magnetic disc hard drive are you joking you know I mean yeah they've

48
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,400
been they've really overplayed that junk for a long time should have never

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,780
been anyway enough of a rant about that but yeah back to the water Skype we'll

50
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,940
just put it out I have to I'm either gonna wing it and put images up in the

51
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,700
text or just do a presentation like a PowerPoint or something to walk everyone

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,560
through it because okay that just a little thing what's going on with the

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,980
water kind of retracted I was past few months I was out showing the scalerator

54
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,500
mark one and all that which was good success and moved quite a few of them

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,760
for it being so new with people in the water industry and whatever and I've

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,100
noticed that there is a communication problem no matter how intelligent the

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,080
person sounds right member they still can't follow directions no matter who it

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,880
is and right now I'm the only ones that will be you know I've seen pictures of

59
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,840
installation like why is that like that that's not how it's supposed to be you

60
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,460
know and right so so right now they're all gonna be emanating from me right

61
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,600
here in Tucson like in other words I'm not sending any more out at the moment

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm gonna just try to get as many as I can within a 50 mile radius here just

63
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,740
because this this is a new device it's well on the surface no what I mean I'm

64
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,040
the only one right that's that can explain it pervade or whatever the last

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,840
thing I want is it being you know not installed at the right application the

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,540
right location the right following certain protocols I'll get into all

67
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,900
that with and I'll demonstrate pictures of what how it's been being used and it

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,200
still works by the way it's just not optimal it's like I don't know following

69
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,900
direction seems to be like I don't know I'm almost impossible well you know it's

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,280
not bad about that as you can almost do a YouTube University on it and if you

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,200
record that whole thing one way or another you can record it into a video

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,180
file and somebody could upload it to a platform whether it's YouTube or not

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,240
yeah I don't mind if they do actually that I think I might have to be

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,340
presented a little better I'll probably do I'll get one of the spare laptops I

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,060
have by the way the reason I'm looking for other computers because I'm using a

76
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,160
laptop as a main computer and a laptop is like a Swiss Army knife right you

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,680
don't use it all the time for everything so you know so anyway you can

78
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,920
get a fresh new computer for a different kind of stuff and do a

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,480
PowerPoint if anybody knows how to do all that stuff reach out let me know and

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,320
I could send you the information and you could put it together if you like or

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,840
whatever if you're interested just images and maybe some text files because

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,240
it's going to be very interesting I just want to show what's going on with it

83
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:27,840
and state of Meg let me just put it this way magnetic reactors they have nothing

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,540
it has nothing to do with magnetism as people have been using including the

85
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:39,240
physicists and scientists scientists I'm spelling with a PS why right so this is

86
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,160
we're going in new territory this is completely new physics completely and

87
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,180
it's all tangible I mean if you've got like $2 in your pocket and there's a

88
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,980
magnet you know basically you could build stuff right so this is nothing

89
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,660
elaborate I remember someone you saw we said group Skype calls more than a

90
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,440
decade ago someone who was a venture capitalist for IP like ideas like take

91
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,020
people's scientific ideas and you know get investors and he says oh I'm gonna

92
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,460
have a call tonight talk about this so he starts talking I'm like I don't

93
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,840
really care about that he's like why is it because you need like this expensive

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,460
thing and this thing that's hard to get whatever don't you got anything you can

95
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,220
make in your kitchen or buy it the hardware store to make something unique

96
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,800
you know it's like you know how they hear all these scientific discoveries

97
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,680
and you're like that stuff is out of reach I think it's coincidental how all

98
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,960
these new scientific discoveries always shown like the materials and the methods

99
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,840
are out of reach from common people right I think it's by design well it's

100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,260
like a little you yeah it's like the guys who tell you look I've got the best

101
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,200
way it's an absolutely foolproof formula for you to make you know all sorts of

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,340
money and this and that and then you get there and you realize yeah only if you

103
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,600
have X amount to invest if you have certain things that you can put into it

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,460
one way or another and it's like well if I don't have that to begin with what's

105
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,400
the point of even being here except oh I already paid this guy a fee so he's

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,200
making money right sounds like you fall for an old one I remember I'm not being

107
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,740
accusatory but I say that when people bring that up because back in like 1974

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,440
on the back of the magazine that I was checking out the magazine right like a

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,900
mark was a comic it was mad I was into mad magazines there were lots of

110
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,700
magazines that had similar things yeah the backs in that if you put a dollar in

111
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,440
an envelope and send it here we'll show you how to make money and with magazines

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,640
so I did that and sent me back a letter and he says you put an ad in a magazine

113
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,940
and you tell people to send a dollar and and you send them a letter that says

114
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,900
how you make money in magazines right it's a closed-loop system right yeah no

115
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,240
no but that that is funny but that is one of the things they actually did in

116
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,320
comic books and mad magazine I think too maybe they did it in that they

117
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,140
offshoot the the you know the bad copy cracked right a couple of things like

118
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,840
that they probably was later yeah yeah basically it was instructions on how to

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,160
put an ad in the magazine which was fairly cheap back then right and tell

120
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,200
people to put a dollar in there that was just a close-up by the way the same

121
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,700
magazines in the back a live monkey for 20 bucks which is $500 in today's money

122
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,640
by the way I think by the way because gold is over 2,000 announced that means

123
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,520
that the Federal Reserve note in trade value is less than a penny by the way

124
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,740
so the dollar buys less than a penny than it did when gold was $20 by the way

125
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,520
a 20 is the score so you know in the in the Westerns they'd say you know I've got

126
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,360
a score to settle people think it was a grudge no doesn't mean the guy owed you

127
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,300
a gold piece right so it right now because it's over 2,000 right do the

128
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:42,140
math but right 20 into 100 right mm yeah 20 times 100 right so it's less 100 is a

129
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,920
hundredth so yeah so the dollar is now less than a penny buying power so I just

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,300
want everybody but anyway back then you can get a monkey in the mail and someone

131
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,380
did get it it was a it was a rumor that got out pretty quick and by the end of

132
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,240
the day when I went to go see the monkey was already gone because the parents

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,940
came home and you know how people have arachnophobia I think the mother had a

134
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,940
monkey phobia she flipped out and I didn't get to see the monkey but I saw

135
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,240
all the packaging and all that and it was about a cardboard box inside of a

136
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,540
cardboard box with poo in it and grass you know dry hay so they did get the

137
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,900
monkey everyone witnessed it and I think they took it away to the ASPCA or

138
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,560
something but yeah you could get monkeys in them so I didn't directly witness the

139
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,960
monkey but I witnessed everything else it's about it getting there it's got

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,400
like and then later on I saw people you know I didn't get involved in these

141
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,980
things but I saw other people do it like you know get all dedicated to Amway for a

142
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,780
minute yep you know isn't and Rubbermaid or Tupperware and I'm sorry and then

143
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,240
Rubbermaid put Tupperware out yeah because they decided to get into it also

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Tupperware was a big yeah but Amway was big I was like yeah I'm so funny it's

145
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,260
like well that sounds interesting and I and then I started recommending it to

146
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,380
people because people I knew parents did it or older siblings did it right and it

147
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,160
was like $10 for a bottle laundry detergent normally be $2 I was like that

148
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,400
doesn't sound right how you know remember that yep she's not how it was

149
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,900
yeah I think it was really those what they call multi-level marketing yeah well

150
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,160
the only interesting part about it was the only useful part of it was that they

151
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,980
they started trying to get you to sell the cleaning products and when you sell

152
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,600
the cleaning products actually it's same methodology that you are talk about

153
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,740
where look you don't need this detergent you can water it down and still use it

154
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,840
because it doesn't need to be made this way and stuff like that like you know

155
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,800
actually putting the thing in the spray bottle and stuff like that like if you

156
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,820
follow those sorts of directions along with selling your stuff you could sell

157
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,620
a year's worth of you know what I'm saying instead of the $2 versus $10 yeah

158
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,520
but you have it now for 12 months instead of spending $2 so they were

159
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,240
selling concentrates yeah yeah what's cheaper and shipping that way to imagine

160
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,180
exactly instead of a gallon of laundry detergent you buy like a cup of it and

161
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,700
you know how many more you can fit on a trailer and how much more value right if

162
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,860
you charge this well right and as I said you know even if it is a $20 or a $10

163
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,600
bottle versus a $2 bottle okay it's five times but if you could use it for

164
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,140
12 months instead of buying a $2 one every month you've just cut your cost in

165
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,380
hand which made sense but that was the part that nobody would follow right so

166
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,980
you know it's like anyway oh yeah they use it normally yeah by the way when I

167
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,980
was at a place in California and and I was there like months at a time and you

168
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,120
know I didn't get very domestic meaning like I didn't I lived there but I didn't

169
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,240
get too domestic we're gonna do shopping it was for a few days worth of food or

170
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,000
whatever I was trafficking in high-end water spring to oh yeah and I'd go in

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,020
the apartment area had a laundry area and I was like you know I haven't bought

172
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,360
laundry soap I need to get laundry soap so this is mostly white people here

173
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
they're not very frugal or they don't see what they're going or by the way

174
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,300
white has nothing to do with the color your skin just meaning bland so in the

175
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,200
laundry room they have the the garbage can and the garbage can was full of empty

176
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,320
tied you know the various liquid detergent bottles right because people

177
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,460
went out they throw it over they're not gonna bring it up to the apartment

178
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,400
again so I said I bet if I go through this garbage gets a clean garbage can

179
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,480
it's a laundry room garbage can right it was basically lint lint from the dryer

180
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,160
and empty bottles and boxes of soap right so it within a few minutes I pulled

181
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,440
out about four or five bottles and I looked in there I took the big you know

182
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,760
the big-ass cap I look in there soap in there soap in there soap in there I put

183
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,020
water in one of them slowly rinsed it out you don't want to agitate it too

184
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,420
much because you have nothing but suds rinsed into the next bottle rinse in

185
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,800
the next bottle before I knew it I had two inches of soap diluted in a bottle

186
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,500
right and I could do my laundry I don't have to stop what I'm doing go buy

187
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,380
laundry soap as a matter of fact they use it for another month so that is like

188
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,540
listen don't buy laundry soap communal laundry room they've got they throw away

189
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,840
their laundry bottles they're still soap residue and they're diluted a little

190
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,020
right because it's super concentrated right because as the bottle gets to be

191
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,520
low the dry out right and you'll have like a you know a pretty decent amount

192
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,360
you know a couple days or weeks worth of laundry just that's being thrown away

193
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,440
on the residue on a big bottle right exactly so people it sounds you sound

194
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,500
like a bag lady or a crazy person when you say that but it's the point you see

195
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,340
it's the idea of the waste and all that so yeah exactly yeah always the case by

196
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,600
the way I haven't bought anything it's time for me to go out and buy dish soap and I

197
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,780
think the last time we've got that was around the midsummer you know the last

198
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,420
year right what you know the pagan year right so that's a long time because if

199
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,120
you don't dilute these things it's like you know you run out of juice like oh

200
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,380
you put it on your list and not every time you shot maybe every other time and

201
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,340
it's like now it's like you're hardly and everything's just as clean by the

202
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,580
way so yeah well as long as you're getting the same result I don't see why

203
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,220
you shouldn't do it you know if you're getting a bad result obviously don't

204
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,120
right but you're not gonna if you if you do it the way that you described a long

205
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,400
time ago in these Sonics here it works just fine I mean oh it does yeah when

206
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,200
you when it's diluted and you cut it comes out of a sprayer it hits such a

207
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,980
large area versus concentrated you put it a little dab on a sponge right that's

208
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,020
not going anywhere even doesn't matter how concentrated it is you know right

209
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,680
right yeah so anyway it's just it's it has nothing to do with laundry soap

210
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,920
Greeks lost his mind what is he doing going through garbage no it has to do

211
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,160
with efficiency and there you are you actually paying attention you know well

212
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,640
and that's the thing is why waste things that are just as useful you know it I'm

213
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,100
not telling you you know pick every bit of food out of the garbage right well

214
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,700
that's that's the other point the other day I brought up restaurants throw away

215
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,160
anywhere between 10 or 20 percent of the food they buy because the patrons don't

216
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,640
eat it so and I was part of a Vietnamese restaurant a decade ago short story made

217
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,500
long here or long story made short I fought the enemies for this place was

218
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,920
off it's kind of like an industrial part of town they're really good and I went

219
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,240
there once and their bathroom was unfinished I went there a week later

220
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,200
again bathroom still unfair said hey listen you guys make good soup here why

221
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,480
is your bathroom finish it was new construction oh my uncle he's 85 years

222
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,020
old he's I'll finish your bathroom I got a redo the most of the plumbing and all

223
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,940
that so then I'll do it you know professional job for you and we do a

224
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,800
barter and soup and they said great so I had like free meals for nine months

225
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,880
for me and the wife there right maybe more nice and it was great but I watched

226
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,460
how much food was thrown away because I would you know when I you know I was like

227
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,260
part of the restaurant now right and you know why because we made fun of white

228
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,860
people anyway that's as you say that yeah yeah anyway by the way with your

229
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:37,940
Vietnamese I just like South Vietnamese all right when you get invaded if your

230
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,920
country gets invaded because you're having problems in your country that's

231
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,280
like if you believe that the part of parts of the country that are having

232
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,900
difficulty with each other are gonna stay separate and you can join one side

233
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,660
you're an idiot what will happen is if you're a foreigner you come in even

234
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,320
though it looks like those two sides within the country are fighting they're

235
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,400
gonna band together against you both how do I know this because when we had ex

236
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,160
military veterans and stuff come into the restaurant you know they'd sometimes

237
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,359
say I was in Vietnam and the people the patrons at the restaurant would say oh

238
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,300
yeah my father he worked with the Americans always you know oh thank you

239
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,480
that's great but when the restaurant closed and we sat back and had shots

240
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,460
and had dinner like oh yeah we would hunt the Americans with bamboo spears we

241
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,100
would make traps the same traps we would make for wild pigs and we'd catch them

242
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,440
and cut them up into pieces you know yeah so and I said because yeah the

243
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,840
Americans are further you're having supposedly a issue and by the way it was

244
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,160
communist north and south whatever no no no the north was Soviet I'm sorry the

245
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,720
north was Chinese and the south was Soviet they're both communists I hate

246
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,240
to mention to you right yeah they had more of a Soviet influence in the south

247
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,340
and more of a Chinese it wasn't communist versus non-communist so look

248
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,420
at your look at what was really going on well the north appeared to really you

249
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,500
know and first of all there's another issue there too and that's religion

250
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,160
which was a problem which nobody talks about in the history books because the

251
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,380
no Buddhist versus the Catholics was a problem there yeah yeah what but Buddhism

252
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,960
is part of Catholic in other words if it Buddhism exists for more than it's part

253
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,980
of the Pope's approval yeah well you know the whole thing is about to make

254
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,660
everybody feel separate you know and fight each other instead of you know and

255
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,980
by the way the most people would say they make us fight each other so we

256
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,440
don't fight them you don't have to fight the powers that be at all all you gotta

257
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,680
do is stop using what they're putting out and do everything with conditions

258
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,760
that's all there's no you know people say we're fight the government why why

259
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,040
didn't fight any government ever that's why I keep saying the Revolutionary War

260
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,940
was a hoax you know the American Revolution was a hoax all you got to do

261
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,000
is just okay you stamp tax or whatever you whatever whatever under these

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,840
conditions that's all and just don't feed it it's all a hoax there is no such

263
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,120
thing as a proper revolution it's foolish it's it doesn't work it doesn't

264
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,160
matter what good it's all it's all you know the fake history all you got to do

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,620
with any anybody in power all you got to do is say yeah I see what you want

266
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,900
you're talking about can you define it and these are the conditions sure or just

267
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,320
don't feed them right right so that's the thing if you don't participate then

268
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,080
they have nothing to work with so you know there's no fighting yeah it's all

269
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,300
that's it's such a hoax it's such a hoax you know all the stuff we've been fed

270
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,320
from all sides all right and that's why you know even even in the preparation

271
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,080
you know the people that get all I'm gonna prepare you know because there's

272
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,580
gonna be this you know situation we're gonna have this civil war and all you're

273
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,760
doing really is just lining somebody's pocket because you're gonna buy all the

274
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,640
stuff well well if you say okay hold on this is more than semantics if you say

275
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm going to prepare means that you're preparing to prepare so why prepare to

276
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,760
prepare why don't you always remain in a prepared state in other words whenever

277
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,740
right it's like when you you know when I leave the house for example I have my

278
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,260
shoes on right sometimes I don't wear socks as I bring a wallet I bring a

279
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,040
lighter some smoke something to drink right you know with me right I mean you

280
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,800
know that's I mean isn't it's a don't you when you wherever you dwell when you

281
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,180
plan on going out whatever it's let's say to commute to work or go out

282
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,220
somewhere don't you bring a few things with you don't be like your keys right

283
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,300
maybe whatever whatever are you do you call that preparation or is that what

284
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,520
you normally do to be more self-sufficient right or to be more I

285
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,360
don't know I want to call it independent whatever so when someone says they need

286
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,460
to get preppy that means they're preparing to prepare to prepare prepare

287
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,660
prepare prepare he sits like looking in the mirror that infinite never it's

288
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,060
never gonna happen right right means that yeah you should always be that bug

289
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,480
out bag thing I've always done that my entire life always I always a as a

290
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
matter of fact that you can ask the wife say what's that's my homeless coat

291
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,000
what's that the homeless coat everybody should have a look I call a homeless

292
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,700
coat it's like if you had to leave with just one thing right it's a certain coat

293
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,820
you have and it's got its water resistant it has lots of pockets right

294
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,960
it could be made if the liner is removable it's got a hood so in other

295
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,000
words any temperature you right well-suited that what I liked is they

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,380
had one in Europe for homeless people where the coat actually turns into a

297
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,220
seen that yeah you're giving it away to homeless people right there's a shelter

298
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,940
it's a the coat itself becomes a shelter okay that's your you know I've always

299
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,460
you know we've been together for more than two decades as that's the homeless

300
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,440
I've been telling people since the 80s you know where's your homeless coat

301
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,220
what's your homeless guy if you had to grab one thing and that's all you had

302
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,660
you know what would it be is it ready you know so you got lots of pocket you got

303
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,320
cash and some you got your knives in the other right you got some sewing thread

304
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,560
some you know bet right a little bit of everything in the coat right yeah yeah

305
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,380
and that's what you end up carrying you know what one way or another you're

306
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,740
gonna you're gonna wind up creating that if you because I you know I wound up

307
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,760
homeless at one point and that that's what you have is you okay now I've got

308
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,560
my pocket for my clean cloth right which is always good to have around

309
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,940
regardless of what conditions you're in and then you got a couple of you know

310
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,180
your your basic medical supplies sort of stuff right might be a bottle of

311
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,800
rubbing alcohol that I would have with me a small one you know things like

312
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,840
that we're essentially actually better off instead of rubbing alcohol just

313
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,860
drinkable alcohol a flask yeah all these things in other words always have right

314
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,600
because they flood the drink the hard liquor will work just as well as right

315
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,600
it actually does yeah you're not you're not a Russian aviator because the right

316
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,840
member of the Russian aviators they would save the ice the alcohol instead

317
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,580
of de-icing the wings on test flights and so the wings would load up with ice and

318
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,840
they'd crash these MIGs and they figured out that they weren't the pilots were

319
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,340
deliberately not de-icing the MIG to save the alcohol so they started giving

320
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,500
alcohol out instead of that but then they were too drunk to fly so you can't

321
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,640
win yeah they're the gun they're either gonna be too drunk to fly or they're

322
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,620
gonna be crashing the planes that's the Soviet Army Soviet Air Force right there

323
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,000
you go yeah so is it the alcohol problem or the people right and that's

324
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,120
why they also started making the MIG so they didn't last more than a few flights

325
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,700
anyway because I don't know about that you know the MIG is the fastest

326
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,820
airplane well up until the Americans decided you know the Americans are given

327
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,620
the go-ahead and it's American technology the the impellers the way to

328
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,060
make the anyways long story but all the titanium used in production comes from

329
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,700
Russia anyway but a lot of you guys know about aviation but nothing nothing was

330
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,320
faster than the MIG other than the SR-71 but the SR-71 didn't have any

331
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,480
armament so no look speed I understand but what I'm saying is they didn't

332
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,160
really make a lot of flights because they weren't very durable they didn't

333
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,180
need to be oh yeah I guess not yeah yeah that was the way it was explained to me

334
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,600
is that well look they didn't need to make a lot of flights because they knew

335
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,780
they were not gonna last and they were designed like that I'm like wow why

336
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,000
would you do that yeah and that was another power play you know the the

337
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,480
whole political situation as far back as you can see it is just yeah you know

338
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,120
I think I've gone over in private Skype calls and maybe other stuff with you

339
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,040
maybe as much not as much with the Parthians you know everyone talks about

340
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,500
the power of the Roman Empire was more of a Roman era but the Romans could not

341
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,160
go east of you know the Jordan River in that part of the they would get their

342
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,960
asses kicked by the Parthians right and it wasn't until a few hundred years

343
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
later that the Romans said hey why can't we be friends is there a song like that

344
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,180
why can't we be friends right yeah so cuz they yeah but everyone thinks the

345
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,940
Romans were invincible and they were to a degree in the European market let's

346
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,400
just say but when they came to you know southwestern Asia no as a matter of fact

347
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,240
they even mentioned to people you know the Knights in shining armor you saw in

348
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,360
the Middle Ages and all that oh yeah that was nothing new that's all barred

349
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,660
from the Parthians who had that for hundreds of years prior to that right

350
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,900
because I something popped up recently where oh the new technology in the

351
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,960
Middle Ages where they use our what do you mean new technology is already a

352
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,500
thousand years old the Europeans just decided to use it oh my gosh so it's

353
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,600
easy to distort you know everything so no absolutely true absolutely speaking

354
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,100
of distortion I had a wonderful call with a wonderful individual recently from back

355
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,360
east and I said you know I'm gonna be doing a sonic later with Ocelli what do

356
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,260
you think I should talk about he says yeah it's the new year so why don't you

357
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,440
talk about something hopeful give people some of us said hold on a second how

358
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,580
could be the new year at the end of the 10th month he's like yeah I get you so

359
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,120
you know I wanted to spend a just a few seconds on that yeah is no matter where

360
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,640
you are you know on the other part of the world it's midsummer right you know

361
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,060
South America all the other places yeah down there so and we're up here right

362
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:10,260
cold it doesn't matter the time is reckoned very similarly if not the same

363
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,180
in other words they have Christmas in Australia it's summertime right on the

364
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:23,500
beach they're right so anyway how how obvious is it that septum is 7 octo is

365
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,660
8 specially octave no of them is 9 and deaths and this 10 it was destined I

366
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,560
think is even more obvious right of course except the word decimate is

367
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,500
never used right when the people who still you say with their estimate that's

368
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,740
all you can pretend and they've usually use that word estimate refer to total

369
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,000
destruction it's not accurate yeah that destination is way too often used to to

370
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,260
project the idea of complete destruction but as you said yeah it's not only by

371
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,660
a tenth yeah yeah it's a good again a Roman thing so and it's like apocalypse

372
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,860
means to reveal apocalyptic yeah reveal yeah so if everything is destroyed when

373
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,180
it's revealed oh my gosh what kind of a world is this right anyway the whole

374
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,660
thing is it's very obvious what's going on and the thing I've mentioned a few

375
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,560
sonics ago is that everything is an intelligence op what you do is you put

376
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,960
out stuff that is so blatantly contrary to what it's supposed to be and watch

377
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,520
who goes for it and if everyone goes for it that means that you could pretty much

378
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,260
say anything contradictory like 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters vaporized the

379
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,840
World Trade Center and people will believe it right or right you know what

380
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,300
was who was the comedian who I remember he talked he did a JFK joke where they

381
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,060
went to the museum where Oswald's opposed to oh yeah this is very accurate

382
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:46,060
because Oswald wasn't there right right he says yeah I went to the 6-4 museum

383
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,640
and I'll tell you I look right in that window and a whole bit and I'll tell you

384
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,980
it was extremely historically accurate Oswald still not in that window brilliant

385
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,820
you see the simplest comedy it works the best so and actually the what is comedy

386
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,320
stuff that's so simple that everyone can relate to but doesn't talk about right

387
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,160
so so what's going on with all this stuff doesn't matter what it is is is an

388
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,500
intelligent everything is backwards and I think it's not it's by design it's by

389
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,980
design because you want to use it to measure engage just like the mercury in

390
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,840
a tube that's graduated with numbers you look at where which number is that it's

391
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,500
that it's that and we all say that's what the temperature is right just like

392
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,920
that it's a measurement tool all of these things that are being put out and

393
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,140
it's in then what happens is if you have the majority go for it then anyone

394
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,140
that's contrary to that then it's it's open it's open game you could say

395
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,640
anything about them you could say oh those people in their contract oh they're

396
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,820
elitist oh or they're geniuses they don't think like once or they're

397
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,180
terrorists or they're crazy you see what I mean right because there's no way to

398
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:02,340
gauge anymore anything you see so you can so if you're not part of if you're

399
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,980
not going along with the collective or the normal think it can go anyway for

400
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,620
you don't know and you can steer it into that direction in other words you can be

401
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,900
called right you know how many times have you seen people go to court for the same

402
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,200
exact traffic ticket one guy gets dismissed the other guy pays the fine

403
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
the other guy gets a double fine but the other guy has to go to jail for the

404
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:29,360
same thing right right so yeah so basically it can go any anything to go

405
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,140
anyway anyway you know like the one guy could be called you know what they call

406
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,940
them freedom fighters right or martyrs or whatever or they could be terrorists

407
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,660
right so the same thing yeah it goes either way and that's tag that along

408
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,760
with what I've said that all subjects and I mean this because I've been

409
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,180
speaking to people professional people lately in their fields and I'm like oh

410
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,920
my gosh this person says they do this they know nothing very little about it

411
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,660
so someone who is in a professional field you what it is I'm not gonna I

412
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,680
don't have to say it's irrelevant any professional field they what they're

413
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,980
working knowledge in that professional field is as not any more than anyone can

414
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,020
learn within a few hours just by punching on the keyboard on that subject they

415
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,020
don't have to use any more than that so it's like everybody's getting some kind

416
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,020
of like just floating slacking along no matter what they're doing it's it's

417
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,860
amazing how it is so attach that to the idea that I've always given that all

418
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,240
fields all subjects are wide open for study doesn't matter what subject if you

419
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,040
want to let's say get into a subject that's already has a domain or a

420
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,960
professional category let's say like brain surgery and most of you say I'm

421
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,380
gonna study brain surgery most people are gonna be like oh that's so

422
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,720
intimidating actually if you spend one week on the computer studying brain

423
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,760
surgery you will have about the amount of functional knowledge that your

424
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,880
typical brain surgeon actually has to know to do brain surgery believe it or

425
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,180
not not more than a week's worth of study that's all they're using it's

426
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:08,200
insane how soft and weak and how would you say underused knowledge and things

427
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,280
are right so what I'm trying to say let's go back to brain surgery or

428
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,240
neurology or whatever specifically brain surgery okay if you studied for a

429
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,700
few weeks or a month brain surgery and you actually applied what you studied

430
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,820
with just online you would actually be able to perform and be at the top of the

431
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:33,080
field right this is how little knowledge is being used by any field at the moment

432
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,700
couple that with everything being automated oh my gosh even before it was

433
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,580
automated they were hardly hardly applied anything okay so what's going on

434
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,040
is I've always I've said this before it's a testament to the robustness of

435
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,900
the human condition humans are tough so for example back with medicine the only

436
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,660
reason you have doctors offices and emergency medicine emergency room is

437
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,420
because the those that are controlled the earth don't want any of that at all

438
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,040
the only reason it exists is because if it didn't exist there would be public

439
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,540
outrage so what they did was they set up the medical community so it gives the

440
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:20,440
absolute minimum of presence in society absolute minimum of presence in society

441
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,900
and does the absolute minimum right I'm talking about even the specialists right

442
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,740
just to prevent public outrage and they also have to throw in there's actually

443
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,680
more effort being put into propaganda and media and all that about medical

444
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,020
stuff right I don't have to say the pandemic to promote it as being something

445
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,920
wonderful right and the people believe that more than what they actually see

446
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,620
them doing you know it's insane yes let's forget about the actual results

447
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,100
it's about the expertise and and the knowledge of how the system works really

448
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,260
that's what you go to anybody for anymore is their knowledge of how the

449
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,480
system works not really about their particular profession I mean we talk

450
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,240
about law all the time and that's a perfect example right the lawyer doesn't

451
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,060
know law he just knows he just knows where the court is he knows who he's

452
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,980
got to talk to and where he's got to put the papers yeah anything up to

453
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,580
anything of the case he's like oh did you cooperate with the judge you do what

454
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,120
the judge said I'm like what judge isn't supposed to say anything he's a judge

455
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,100
right what are you talking about I'm getting railroaded here oh well it

456
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,220
doesn't really work that way you know I'm like oh yeah really it's I said it

457
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,500
saying doesn't really work that way how about I tell you it's not working at

458
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,360
all and you guys are yeah yeah you guys are just playing a different game here

459
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,400
and calling it something else and that's what it comes down to is your your

460
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,220
medical professional doesn't know anything about me it's the same thing

461
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,960
same thing you wouldn't believe you ever get a message that it's the wrong

462
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,220
number but they leave a message anyway yeah and I think I've gone over my

463
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,580
greeting oh yeah I love that but when I side-track that have a greeting on the

464
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,420
answering machine guys when you call it's a woman with a British accent and

465
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,600
she says you have reached the number that number that you have just dialed if

466
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,460
you believe you've dialed it an error hang up and dial it again now you

467
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,760
wouldn't believe how many times they see a number that I didn't recognize and they

468
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,520
let it ring they get the greeting and they hang up and then like 10 seconds

469
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,860
later 30 seconds later they call back right away I don't know who's calling I

470
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,940
know a lot about that person that greeting gives it up what it tells me

471
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,420
is this person doesn't know how to listen they're not listening all they

472
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,040
got was dial it again or something yeah yeah instead of let instead of letting

473
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,800
the greeting got right so yeah yeah so it teaches me a lot right now it's

474
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,500
radical analog engine tuning right with a British accent like I thought there

475
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:47,080
was really some kind of what is that I'm like anyway yeah so yeah so you set up

476
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,380
these things to let you know what people really are but anyway on the phone

477
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:56,020
with the pandemic you wouldn't believe how many some number that I'm using must

478
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,460
be similar to some medical place the nurses would call back and leave a

479
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,880
message and not even listening to the greeting and saying that yeah you can

480
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,480
come and visit the doctor only if you show that you've gotten your vaccine and

481
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,580
this is the nurse's doctor's office putting this on the people that's

482
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,640
criminal yeah you're talking about criminals yeah so anyway I don't want to

483
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,360
hear about Nazis or this or that or Ku Klux Klan or all these other things what

484
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:30,140
was it what was it Oh Mel Brooks blazing saddles like the worst people in the

485
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,020
world memory showed like some Nazis and Ku Klux Klan and like what Americans

486
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,480
consider to be the worst right parts of society right in the end right do you

487
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,860
remember that movie is the film there's a whole string of like you know all the

488
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,280
worst societies maybe maybe a couple of communists were thrown in there all the

489
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,140
propaganda stuff right they did an open call for like the worst people and yeah

490
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,320
yeah that's right yeah and who showed up yeah so you expecting to see in some

491
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,100
film to tell you that the medical community is in that league also are you

492
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,380
is that what the public is waiting for it's not gonna happen guys or the legal

493
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,780
community legal community was even car mechanics there are films out there

494
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,360
that show you that but but here's the thing they're not taken seriously right

495
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,580
it's like the message the message on the machine that tells you you reach the

496
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,620
number that you're supposed to have reached that just tells you yeah you got

497
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,500
the right number according to this and they still hang up and call back yeah

498
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,500
one of the things also the conversation I had before we started this sonic was

499
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,640
that it's very similar to this how it's all gangsterism in a sense tribalism

500
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,880
right and it's like feudalism but tribalism but the problem with using

501
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,300
that term is when you have tribalism those that are leading the tribe have

502
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,460
care for the tribe they make sure the tribe is well equipped that they're

503
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,580
strong they're fed they have weapons right right this type of tribalism is

504
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,620
weakening the tribe exactly exactly because when you actually have a tribal

505
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,220
leader they care about that that's the only reason why they are a leader is

506
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,620
because they maintain the strength of the tribe that is how that works on a

507
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,720
ground level it makes sense but when you have people that are you know

508
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,540
adopting these false tribes right these tribes that have nothing to do with them

509
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,640
but yet okay you're gonna put on a uniform you're gonna put on a certain

510
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,500
color you're going to wear certain things you're gonna identify yourself a

511
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,000
certain way that it you're given all these false prescriptions right to

512
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,740
identify you in some fake tribe well of course your fake tribalism doesn't get

513
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,480
anywhere real tribalism actually works yeah real yeah right and feudalism I'm

514
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,280
looking forward to the days of the the anarchist feudal warlords again because

515
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,620
at least there you know if anybody's ever had any dealings with the mob and

516
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,860
the if you watch like Sopranos or something like that which is very

517
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:00,260
accurate by the way they are far more honorable than attorneys and doctors and

518
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,840
government people and priests and all that stuff right that you see you far

519
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,840
more honorable if they tell you they're gonna do something they do it and if

520
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,500
they don't members of their own organization admonish those who didn't

521
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,700
follow through you don't even have to you know what I mean exactly that's the

522
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,800
thing I've always said that that is the one guarantee you have is well two things

523
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,060
really you know they wear better suits than politicians and they absolutely do

524
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,660
some of the things they say they're gonna do because otherwise there's no

525
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,860
reason for them to exist yeah they enforce their own yeah they enforce

526
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,000
their own right you know and that's and that's how you get a more honorable

527
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,240
result regardless of what the activity is look if you if you go into an

528
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,620
agreement you better follow it because they sure as hell are gonna hold up

529
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,540
there and yeah it's not like Darth Vader it was at the second movie we kept

530
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:01,380
changing the deal right with Colt 45 was the actor 40 Billy Dee Williams yeah

531
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,280
yeah yeah right I bet if you look at this one black people and Asian people

532
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,140
do not age right and some Latinos also you ever see like you know I don't know

533
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,180
if it was Billy Dee Williams or somebody so he's got to be in his 80s and he

534
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,620
looks like he's in his late 50s or something I see some actors like that

535
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,900
he still looked good in the last Star Wars movie they just like dropped him

536
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,400
into that Star Wars movie a couple years ago and it's like dude that's 40 years

537
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,840
later look at him I know yeah yeah he looks like he's 10 years he looks like

538
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,480
he's 10 years maybe right right right and yeah I don't bring him up as he

539
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,660
kept telling Darth Vader you know you it's not our original agreement you

540
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,660
know he's like you think I'm that big Darth Vader's like you don't think I'm

541
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:49,960
being fair with you I don't alter our agreement further so this is so what

542
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,420
they have to show you that stuff and like Darth Vader by the way I think

543
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:59,260
Vader's is cool as shit so but anyway I mean this is the stuff that's going on

544
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,440
right in front of people and they still take party sides and all this other

545
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,340
stuff it's like whoa there's something wrong here but just maybe to end this

546
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,080
summer on another thought because no matter how they keep altering the

547
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,160
agreement Greek and they keep adjusting the people keep adjusting to it so it

548
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,020
doesn't matter if he alters the agreement but again that's why Darth

549
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,560
Vader's not in the mob because he's just on his own league but they're that

550
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,900
league that mentality is being pushed on people constantly and they're going for

551
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,580
it right and they don't have to and but the thing is also if you really want to

552
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:40,640
find out like there's a the silent part we've segue we talked about the voice in

553
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,920
your head is not you and it changes as you change right if you were to make a

554
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,040
big lifelong change like let's say for example you're just strolling along or

555
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,860
whatever as a normie and you decide to become a Scientologist right and you

556
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,140
study all that stuff and now you join that group the voice in your head will

557
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,900
change they're gonna have to put another one in your head who's they I

558
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,780
think I've gotten into it yes it's a spiritual thing they're gonna have to

559
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,680
get rid of the one that's giving you the voice in your own tone that you think is

560
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,500
you and switch to another voice that is more in line with what the Scientology

561
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,860
narrative is but if you're so lucky or fortunate they may not have one

562
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,620
available right away so you might have a few days or a few weeks even before they

563
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,900
find their replacement for that voice in your head and you will have an extreme

564
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:36,220
sanity and peace during that time that's why very often when you hear people I

565
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,080
converted to Buddhism I became a Scientologist or a vegan or blah blah

566
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,100
change like that when they first change over and you can relate to them speak

567
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,900
to them they are so happy and they are so at peace it's not because of the

568
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,580
organization that they're going to it's that they change the narrative in their

569
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:04,600
head now another being has to be dispatched to assign a new dialogue in

570
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,920
your head that you think is you see I think that's scary they should make a

571
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,780
movie about they really should because that perfectly explains to me why it is

572
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,620
you know when people get full on you know they make that decision and they

573
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:22,180
go okay I've given myself to the JES oh same same doesn't matter what you give

574
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,540
yourself to but they give themselves over to that and they are so joyous and yeah

575
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,760
for an interim for an interim and I looked at him and I go wow how do you

576
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,280
get that joyous over something that you know first of all I know you're

577
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,240
following some BS here but nonetheless because they've gone into that

578
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,280
changeover mode they are elated it is the thing the reason why is because the

579
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,440
being that most people think well the voice in the head that people think is

580
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,860
their own voice is actually another being doing that right and that being

581
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,980
may not be suited to provide the narrative the voice in your head because

582
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,920
you've just changed your narrative so they have to dispatch another they have

583
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,540
an entire organization for that and or it's better to put another being in your

584
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,040
head than to try to train the current one right and in that interim it may

585
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,500
sometimes not true sometimes they might find a replacement overnight but

586
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,720
typically when I when I talk to people and seeing this it takes usually about a

587
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,360
week to a month sometimes to find another being to give them the voice and

588
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,740
during that time now there is when they they're elated and also when the new

589
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,320
being comes in they they notice a radical change like maybe they didn't

590
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,520
make the right decision but they already told everyone so they have to stick to it

591
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,700
and they romanticize that time right so when it was quiet when the being wasn't

592
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,780
in their head giving them the voice so here's the point the point is this find

593
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:56,140
if you can convincingly change your ways it doesn't matter what it is you you

594
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,540
meat eater become vegan become what really it could be religion social

595
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,280
change whatever whatever join the KKK or the Nazi neo-nazi party right whatever

596
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,400
you found your passion found your purpose you found a better way you're

597
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,060
enjoying the Red Cross I like that was a movie The Black Klansman right yeah I

598
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,860
haven't seen it I have to stream that but you got to make fun of all this

599
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,400
stuff because none of it is and I'm sure there are black Klansmen by the way so

600
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,580
the whole thing is just a radical change but you have to be convincing enough you

601
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,730
will find peace and quiet because not because of the organization again I'm

602
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,170
repeating myself it's very important to remember it's not what it is it's how

603
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,350
it's being done in other words you are changing your entire outlook on life

604
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,130
because when someone let's say becomes a born-again chicken sandwich like the

605
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:50,950
Chick-fil-a right and and yeah that's not true they're a Christian organization

606
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,930
I know yeah I called the born-again chicken sandwich so anyway when you do

607
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,590
anything like that anything it doesn't matter doesn't matter what are you go

608
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,930
become a Satan I'm not saying Oh Greek says become KKK or become a Satanist no

609
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:06,110
no it doesn't matter just change you can dedicate you're gonna notice doesn't

610
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,310
matter what you change to again I can't underscore emphasize that enough a

611
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:17,150
quietness okay so why not why not evict the voice in your head by constantly

612
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,750
anticipating it whenever you hear the voice in your head just say okay I hear

613
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,690
you what do you have to say next but you're not supposed to say that to your

614
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,090
own self right they'll say oh my gosh they he this one knows what's going on

615
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,910
and seek that quiet now if you can't do that enough I'm not saying that they

616
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:38,350
won't ever leave you alone no because what will happen is they'll bypass the

617
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,270
one that they were sending over and they're gonna send the swap team over

618
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,430
what I mean is they're gonna send one that's very hard to find but they do

619
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:50,210
have them and this one will anticipate your all of your moves so you're gonna

620
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,790
think you're psychic because you can tell what's gonna happen in five minutes

621
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,370
for ten minutes or next week and you could tell what people are thinking and

622
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,030
you know what it's provable and that you ever hear these people say I'm psychic

623
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,130
or they've fallen for that everyone is if one person is psychic that means

624
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,810
everyone is psychic right I'm not talking about special training like

625
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:15,170
Tiger Woods where you're raised at two years old you have a rattler in one hand

626
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:19,210
and a golf club in the other that's different if one person has a natural

627
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,690
ability to do something that means everyone has that natural ability it's

628
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:28,170
just late so what'll happen is if you keep bugging them about you know that

629
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,730
what their game they're playing they're gonna send one like Darth Vader but you

630
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,790
won't be like Darth Vader he will that entity will make you sight literally you

631
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,970
will be able to anticipate I don't know a few seconds a few minutes whatever you

632
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,210
will be a functioning psychic and when you get you get so impressed by that

633
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:51,850
you'll fall for it right don't does that make any my making any sense yeah

634
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:57,110
so in other words you can't escape this right right yeah it was so but so does

635
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,870
it mean you have to mess with them no because it'll take eventually they'll

636
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:04,230
mess with you back so hard that you might have to be locked up but there's a

637
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:10,590
fine balance where you can spend anywhere between 0.3 seconds to 5

638
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:17,050
seconds a day entertaining what thought they put in your head anticipate it and

639
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:22,610
watch it go silent and that 0.3 seconds to 10 seconds of silence is really who

640
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:27,630
you are and you could pick up on that emo and that feeling and then it's it

641
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,970
you'll notice how we're here to forget we're here to be confused and all that

642
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,770
on the outside is happening and on the inside it's total silence and and

643
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,030
confidence you know and no fear
