1
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,990
Sonic event number eight here on this particular day, whatever day it is that you are capturing

2
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,950
this and deciding to listen to it.

3
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,310
Welcome to you wherever you are, whenever you are.

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:48,610
And interesting thing, because I'm going to first, I guess, start with the question that I used to start a bunch of the public Ocelli and the Greeks with, which is a Greek, you know, what, what, what day is it not, not according to the Pope's work schedule.

5
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,750
Well, let's do that one.

6
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:58,090
It's it's what they call 319 2023 that I see on the on the on the screen here in front of me.

7
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:07,790
Yeah, I would suggest that it's the 14th day of the first month, a reckoning here near Tucson, Arizona.

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:16,610
OK. And yeah, yeah, that's, you know, it's it's how would we say here's one way to think about it.

9
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,410
You know, the sun rules the day and the moon rules the month, basically the metric.

10
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,230
Right. You know, it's not like a tape measure where, you know, you got the inches and feet and all that on the same thing.

11
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:41,450
Right. Imagine you had you used you're working in carpentry or whatever and you need to tape measures because one one, you know, one only measures length and the other one measures with.

12
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,370
Think about that for a moment.

13
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,910
It doesn't put your panties in a twist, so no twist at all.

14
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,610
You know, what I was thinking is actually it's, again, important to remember.

15
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,350
And I'm starting to utilize this a bit.

16
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:07,910
And I don't know if you want to get into this today, but just thinking about the idea that the day beginning at what most people call noon.

17
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,690
Right. Yeah. Solar, solar, solar noon.

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,030
When the sun is at that point in the sky, the day begins there.

19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:26,290
I got to tell you, it's an it's an odd adjustment, but it makes more sense to me internally than than the the way that, you know, people have presented it.

20
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,210
You know, you wake up, it's still dark outside most of the time, you know, because they tell you the day is supposed to begin at this time and it's still dark or it's just becoming light.

21
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,970
You know, at that time and you say, OK, this is where light begins, but not really.

22
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,750
The day begins with with that highest point in the sky that just feels right.

23
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,190
So anyway, beginning to reckon the day is one thing. Right.

24
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,890
So we got the day and then oddly, though, we're in the first month.

25
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:03,190
Now, is that sort of because it's spring and spring is the beginning of.

26
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,070
Well, it's the beginning of things. Right. It's it's where things begin.

27
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,030
I don't know. It just feels right when you say it's the first month as opposed to.

28
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,910
Well, now they would call it the third. Third. Right. Yeah.

29
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,410
It just feels more right that this is the first month. It feels more right that the day begins at noon.

30
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,270
Solar noon. It just feels more right.

31
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,290
So I don't know. I'm just throwing that in.

32
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,410
Well, you're you're in what they call the continental U.S. like me.

33
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,710
Let's say Southeast. I'm in Southwest. But there are a bunch of folks living upside down.

34
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,830
Right. Where right now they're going into winter.

35
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,710
You know, South America, South Africa, the Aussies, New Zealand. Right.

36
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,570
Right. So they're going into winter. I don't really address that.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:54,710
And I've I have there's an overriding aspect where it's I take the season as a precedent.

38
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,710
So I ever suggested to people that if you're living down there and it's going into winter,

39
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,890
you would be at the seventh month instead of the first month because it's seasonally this way, because this is agricultural.

40
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:13,170
So if you start looking at it as the first month for planting and the winter is just starting, you're kind of like going to have a hard time.

41
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,769
Right. It's not going to work well for you. So I suggest that it's seasonally based being Earth based.

42
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,410
Let's say I mean, when I say Earth based, I don't mean from the astronomical point of view, but meaning that we have to live off of the Earth.

43
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,950
Right. Legitimately. You know, I basically discussed this with a computer programmer once.

44
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,030
I don't really live off the Earth on a computer programmer. I'm like, where are you wearing blue jeans?

45
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,970
Right. It's cotton. And you're wearing those blue jeans, got metal buttons.

46
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,410
Someone was mining to get that metal. Right. And you're going to go for lunch.

47
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,590
You know, something was grown or slaughtered for you to eat. You know, people are that disconnected, by the way, in a trivial way.

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:02,150
But I want to go back to the solar noon. An easy way to discern that is when you're let's say at any part of the world,

49
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,730
you will see that when the shadow when it's morning, the shadow of the sunlight goes towards the West and the opposite in the afternoon.

50
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:16,030
It goes towards the East. So when your shadow is just do in the center, neither East or West,

51
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,150
it's going to be a little towards the North or towards the South. If you're living on the other end, that's when it's noon time.

52
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,670
And you make marks basically on the ground. You could use a stick. Right.

53
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,210
So that that would be solar noon. It's not just the reckoning is is measurable.

54
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,090
Here's the thing. Time is the recordation, memorialization, record keeping of events.

55
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:49,070
If there is no record keeping, there is no time. But if you're Earth based, let's say you have to eat plants.

56
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,390
They will tell time for you. Right. Right. You know, if you're growing a garden, you know,

57
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,530
you have a plant that comes from a seed and then it bears vegetables for you to eat.

58
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,750
Then the vegetables come off and the plant dies and the cycle starts again sometime in the future.

59
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,070
Whether you have multiple crops that year or you have to wait till next year, you could use that for keeping time.

60
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,930
When the cucumber comes up, it's this. Right. You see. So you're still measuring events even.

61
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,690
OK, so so everything will everything that anything that changes will measure has a measurable event.

62
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:30,250
If you record it, you know. OK, so without having extreme precision, let's say for some, even in ancient times,

63
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,530
you're not going to have precise records. So the sundial was very, very precise.

64
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,550
In essence, the longer the armature or the the reference, what would you call it?

65
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,170
The landmark is, you know, the stick. Let's say the more the longer the angle, the more accurate it is.

66
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:59,430
For example, if even today in India, just to do a search, large sundials or large sun structures in India,

67
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,250
they build these things look like buildings. They look like modern art buildings and they're very old.

68
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,770
Some of them are, you know, three, four stories tall. Right. To measure the time.

69
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:20,630
And when you get to a shadow that's that long from a structure sundial that large and they don't look like sundials in the Western world,

70
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,710
you can get it down to a tenth of a second, a hundredth of a second. Right.

71
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,730
Just like now. Right. Don't you have stopwatches digital that gets down very, very accurate.

72
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:37,310
So the reason I said this, it's kind of redundant is because when people you start telling people to stick in the ground and the bigger it is and the straighter it is,

73
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,130
the more they think, you know, measuring shadows is primitive. You know, we're more advanced than that.

74
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,290
No, you can go as far down to the split second as you like with it. You see. OK.

75
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,810
So it depends on what you're using to measure it. It's not a matter of it's, you know, unrefined.

76
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,970
It's not like you're trying to cut things with it with a blunt stone.

77
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,310
You depending on how you sharpen it, that that's that's how sharp it is.

78
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,410
I mean. Well, yeah. And you want it's techno lithic lithic, meaning rock or stone because it's more stable.

79
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,830
But at one point I used a concrete pad with steel cable and all this other stuff and it gets really, really accurate.

80
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,170
I mean, you'll see the shadow move just as much as watching the seconds dial on a clock.

81
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,350
It's that it's that refined. But, you know, you're talking about dedicating a structure.

82
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,490
So in essence, this is just as accurate as any other system.

83
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,450
It's a relative system because if the if the earth stops and the sun stops, time stops. Right.

84
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,030
And this had happened around 2011, by the way, in the spring for a very short time.

85
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,110
And I had a witness to that guy named Jerry Kirk in Arkansas.

86
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,390
I was not in I was in California at the time.

87
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,810
He just desperately wanted to get in touch with me if I had witnessed and I had not.

88
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,730
But he had. I know. I don't think I ever got into that, but that's all I could say about it.

89
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,910
Time did stop for a short time around 2011 in the spring.

90
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,790
OK, so you said you feel you feel it. Well, because you're biological. Right.

91
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:23,590
All of the systems, I would even say metals and minerals and things that grow on the earth,

92
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,550
because metals and minerals do grow. If you look at naturally found gold in quartz in the ground,

93
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,150
it almost looks like it grew into that shape. You know what I mean?

94
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,650
Well, there are mineral elements in your bloodstream, too. Right.

95
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,850
So which are affected by many things. Native Americans had shown me this in the past.

96
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,730
You know, the the the effect of magnetism on on your blood and this kind of thing.

97
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm not saying I fully understand it. I'm just saying I recognize that that's part of the you know,

98
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,270
part of the the mix, so to speak. Right. Right.

99
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,470
And remember the all that all that mineral and metal in your blood is created by the body out of out of.

100
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,290
Well, through induction, I was going to say through by thin air.

101
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,290
But, no, we've kind of covered that.

102
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,510
I probably will do more of an advanced aspect into that because I am every day.

103
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,270
I do think about it, how things are produced in the body.

104
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:28,230
And there are ways to manipulate that. And terrariums are a good idea, by the way.

105
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,130
Grow a terrarium, you know, where you lock close everything up in a bottle.

106
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,250
You don't add water. Things grow in there and the bottle gets heavier and heavier, even though it's completely sealed.

107
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,370
That's one way to think about it.

108
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:46,390
But anyway, to go back to time, when you feel the noontime being when the day starts, that's actually quite correct,

109
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,370
because that's pretty much how things work.

110
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:58,790
And most people tend to venerate those that are intelligent, you know, the geniuses or the wise men of the world.

111
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,170
Right. But when you get into what these people put out, you know, the really, quote, unquote, smart people,

112
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,050
if you were to spend time with them, how are you so smart?

113
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,050
Well, they'll tell you it's all intuitive, right?

114
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,530
It's not book smart, right?

115
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,750
So the intuition that comes along with understanding the day starts at noon.

116
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,990
It's also in the language when you fast for a day, you end your fast by eating, you break your fast, right?

117
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,650
That's before noon.

118
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,050
Okay, so there's many aspects to that.

119
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,810
You know, years ago, anything past noon was considered the next day, on and on.

120
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,530
This is stuff, basic Greek speak stuff.

121
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,570
You could do your own research.

122
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,050
And most college courses still in astronomy do dedicate about five minutes or a half a paragraph that the day starts at solar noon.

123
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:49,750
Right.

124
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,230
And we talked about that during the banking discussion, too, about how, you know, after a certain time of the day,

125
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,850
it would become the next day, even though, technically speaking, the calendars had not changed.

126
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,630
Well, because there's two systems to separate.

127
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,170
Right.

128
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:13,010
It's the – I think you always put out – it's like a metric to see where society is.

129
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,970
You give them two choices.

130
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,790
One is obviously wrong and for the dummies, and the other one is sustainable through verification and, you know, actual knowledge and things that work.

131
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:29,690
And if you notice that most of the population goes for the real dumb shit, well, you've got a real dumb shit population, and this is how you control them.

132
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:38,430
If you notice that you have a good amount of the population going for the stuff that is based on, you know, accurate knowledge or things that are verifiable,

133
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,070
then you're going to have to control them a different way.

134
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,770
And by the way, those are really difficult to control, right, because they ask too many questions.

135
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,750
Well, yeah.

136
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:56,130
I mean, I think if you're prepared for the questions, though, maybe it's not so difficult, but we don't know that verifiably because I have not witnessed it.

137
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,050
Well, what do you mean, which side?

138
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:12,250
Well, a more – okay, a society asking questions, if you know how to direct those questions properly, okay, it's just like any debate, any discussion, it can be handled.

139
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,090
I don't think it would require that much more difficulty.

140
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,510
You know, just intuitively I feel like it wouldn't, actually.

141
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:28,370
Well, we went through – well, in most people's memory, the second time that you're not supposed to question what they say with the plandemic,

142
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,890
before that it was 9-11 and before that it was most likely JFK, the big ones, you know, that you're not supposed to question.

143
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,770
Right, right.

144
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:41,350
Because the knowledge put out is, you know, unmoving and that's the way it is.

145
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:48,330
Yeah, obviously all that stuff is tailored towards the dummies, what they put out, which is the majority.

146
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,170
Okay, so the Sun, again, there's no way to really emphasize it.

147
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:59,390
It just is, and everybody's going to have their own, quote-unquote, personal relationship on how that works for them, right?

148
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,250
And you could study that, by the way.

149
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,870
Without even studying, unfortunately there's not much in the written you can get these days unless you really make a big effort.

150
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:19,050
If you're studying the Sun starts – the day starts at solar noon with the Sun, you can't query that very easily.

151
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,170
I mean, if you put that in, let's say, a browser search, you know, Google it, people say, you're not going to get much, very little.

152
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:33,930
But if you start searching the behavior, certain behaviors and cultures and traditions that are done around noontime or early afternoon,

153
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,990
you're going to start to see, you know, the siestas in Europe, everybody eats lunch and takes a nap, right?

154
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,090
It's the end of the day, right?

155
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,570
They shut down all the stores about 11.30 or so in Spain, right?

156
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,030
And they open the stores back up at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, right?

157
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,010
You see, so it's the end of the day.

158
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,430
So you could look at all the various cultural – you mentioned Native Americans.

159
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:02,690
They have a very rich – if you can get into it, very rich history about the day starting at noon and things that they've done or did culturally.

160
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,690
So that's pretty much it with the Sun for now.

161
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:15,650
When you go to the moon, you start speaking on anything with the moon right away.

162
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,930
I've gotten a few comments.

163
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,470
People say, oh, you're on the lunar calendar.

164
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:21,810
No, no, no.

165
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,350
It's not lunar.

166
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,130
It's not solar.

167
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,690
It's both.

168
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,090
The Sun determines when the day begins and ends and where the days start is determined precisely.

169
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:39,990
And the moon determines your monthly feature, you know, where you have the four weeks per month, when the month begins.

170
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,870
The way you really date things are typically what day of the month.

171
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,690
People didn't really add numbers.

172
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,450
We still don't add numbers to days.

173
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,330
It's not day 245 or it's not – I think now it would be like day 100 or something.

174
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,770
We don't speak like that.

175
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,990
We say it's March, meaning the moon, whatever, right, or April, whatever.

176
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,010
So the days are not really numbered as much as they are parts of the month.

177
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,350
So when you reckon when the month starts, you actually get a better day count.

178
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,050
So that's the difficult part maybe that I've noticed – well, not the difficult part.

179
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:24,230
It's less clear, and more people I've noticed that have tried to figure the system out have had more difficulty with the moon than with the sun.

180
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,490
Let's just put it that way.

181
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:36,470
Right, but I have heard you say in the past fairly simply how to reckon when the moon begins its cycle, right?

182
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,790
So that should be when we have an actual new moon, right?

183
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,490
That should be the beginning of that monthly cycle, unless I'm misunderstanding.

184
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,970
There's two misunderstandings there.

185
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,350
Okay.

186
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:58,370
The cycle is part of a bigger cycle, meaning whether you have 12 or 13 moons,

187
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,210
and the new moon is the full moon, not the dark sliver, because you can't measure anything with the dark sliver.

188
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:15,430
In other words, how would you measure the start of the month visually using light of the moon with the dark sliver that they call the new moon?

189
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,849
You can't.

190
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,390
But with the full moon, you use the same sun dial or you make a moon dial, right?

191
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,650
It casts a shadow and you can measure, you can see the progress along the equatorial as well.

192
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,010
So when you say new moon, it's the full moon.

193
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,130
I'm using the word new moon because it adds conflict, and the new moon I think I've given…

194
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,830
Well, yeah, I meant the moon when it is fully observable is what I meant, actually, when I said new moon.

195
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,310
So it's full moon, dark moon, yeah.

196
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,270
Okay, so the full moon versus the dark moon, and the dark moon would be when you have a sliver or maybe not even a discernible sliver, right?

197
00:17:52,270 --> 00:18:07,030
Well, what happens is it goes, it wanes and it becomes absent, and then it's absent for a night, and then it appears again maybe the next night as a very fine crescent, and then it waxes to a larger…

198
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,250
Right.

199
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,170
And also you'll notice that the moon is at a different position during the day.

200
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:35,930
When you get more into this and the night, like, for example, if you knocked someone out and they woke up from a coma a month later or six months later or a year later and they went outside, it doesn't matter what day or night it is, time of day or night or week or whatever, can you go outside at any time of day or night and look up or look at the sky and figure out what day it is and what month it is?

201
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,950
That's pretty advanced, right?

202
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,610
That's fairly advanced from what I can observe, yeah.

203
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,430
Well, I could do that, by the way.

204
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:42,870
Okay.

205
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,750
Because I've been looking at it for two decades now, and I can give a brief explanation, a real short way.

206
00:18:49,750 --> 00:19:08,010
But, for example, if you're out in the morning, any time between sunrise and, let's say, 11-ish, a couple of hours before noon even, and you see the moon in the sky going from east to west, it's the first 10 days of the month, right, depending on where it is.

207
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,010
You see?

208
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,430
That's an easy example.

209
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:22,030
If you're going out in late afternoon and, let's say, 3-ish, 4-ish before sundown and you see the moon is up in the east, you're probably in the late 20s of your day.

210
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,290
You're in the third week.

211
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,970
Okay.

212
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:24,830
Right?

213
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:34,650
And then where you are at night, again, so the moon, you could actually keep time with the moon where it is in the sky at any time during the day or night.

214
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,390
When it's absent completely during the day, it's the middle of the month.

215
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,930
Right?

216
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:40,530
Okay.

217
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,790
And then you use other factors.

218
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:49,930
So, this is more, believe it or not, there are people even today that can't read an analog clock down to a second or a minute.

219
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:57,790
You know, usually when someone looks at an analog clock on the wall, let's say it's 3-27, everyone tends to say, well, it's about 3-30, right?

220
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,750
Right.

221
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:05,410
But if you ask people, let's say it's a large clock and it's graduated down to the minute, what time is it?

222
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,370
They'll look at it, well, it's 3-30 and a couple of lines short.

223
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,270
You know what I mean?

224
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,150
They don't really – so, it's along that function as well.

225
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,410
How well are you at reading instruments?

226
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:29,270
When the sky becomes an instrument, well, now you're pretty fully engrossed in your environment in terms of timekeeping.

227
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,930
So, let's get into the moon a little bit.

228
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,390
Many people are – again, very easy to figure out solar noon.

229
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,310
It's pretty general, but if you want to be precise, we just said how to do it with shadows.

230
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:48,690
Now, the moon is a little more complicated, not because it should be or it really is, but it just appears to be initially when you get into this.

231
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,270
And sometimes people miss a day or so.

232
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,130
They'll think it was the full moon a day after or two.

233
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,330
So, instead of it being the 14th day, some people think it's the 13th day or the 15th, right?

234
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,150
You have a day off.

235
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,850
One day off.

236
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,070
Okay.

237
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,770
One way to look at it is very simple.

238
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,610
Well, the first way to look at it is when is the moon full?

239
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,430
That's when it is the most round and the brightest.

240
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:24,990
It has nothing to do with how big it appears in the sky because after the moon is full, you'll notice it rises much later and it seems much larger, much, much larger.

241
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,250
But if you look at it, it's not as bright given the surface area, luminosity, and it's not very round.

242
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,690
It's kind of like a flat spot, like between 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock, if it were a clock.

243
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,390
Okay.

244
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:47,750
If it's a little shy, if it's prior, if it's before the full moon, it'll be a little flatter on the lower part of the moon and it won't be as bright, right?

245
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,350
And it'll be smaller, way smaller.

246
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:57,590
So, the full moon is defined at how round it is and how bright it is for its surface area because you could really get some really big moons.

247
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,290
You could look at moon images and people say, hey, look, it's the full moon.

248
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,690
And they like to photograph it because it's a huge moon, right?

249
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,590
And it's like three days after the full moon, right?

250
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,630
But they just call it a full moon and it's still within the full moon, quote, unquote, festival or time of the beginning of the month.

251
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,010
So, yeah, so generally, if you're going to say the beginning of the month, it's a two or three day spread.

252
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,250
It could be as much as four day spread, right?

253
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:21,670
Okay.

254
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,670
But do you want to get more accurate than that?

255
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,330
Most likely you do if you're listening to us.

256
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:26,950
Right.

257
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,650
Because you want to be able to number the days and figure out what portion of the month it is.

258
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,370
Right.

259
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,370
So that you know when the next month comes and, yeah, okay.

260
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,530
Yeah, or what day of the week it is, let's say.

261
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:48,130
So, one, the easiest way to also begin looking at the full moon is you'll notice that before the moon is full,

262
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,690
it kind of rises in the east and there's still a lot of blue sky.

263
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,710
And if you look over to the west, you'll see the sun disk is still visible.

264
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,950
It's just maybe touching the horizon, maybe slightly below, but you can see the sun disk.

265
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,730
Well, in that case, the moon hasn't ruled over the sun.

266
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,230
I don't want to sound like an astrologer or whatever, but there are dominations in the sky.

267
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,630
What dominates is the feature to pay attention to.

268
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:19,910
So if you see the sun disk in the west and the moon is coming up, it's still a little before the full moon.

269
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,750
If you see the moon rising in the east and it appears to be kind of yellow, that's because of the atmosphere,

270
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,990
the dust through the atmosphere.

271
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:35,870
And if you look over to the west and the sun is below the horizon, there's a 99% chance that's the full moon.

272
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,110
Okay, so, and it would be coming up in the 12th hour.

273
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:50,490
So your hours with the sun, by the way, there are 12 hours in the day, daylight.

274
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,450
But it's divided by 10, right?

275
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:00,950
So it's 18 degrees each, 6 plus 6 plus 6 per hour, right?

276
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,870
What does that mean?

277
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,370
Okay.

278
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,630
There are 12 hours of daylight, but the sky is divided into 10 segments.

279
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,190
So noon is in the middle, you have 5 on the left, 5 on the right.

280
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,630
Well, how does that give us the 12 hours?

281
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:26,350
Well, the first hour is when light appears in the east and the sun is still below the horizon.

282
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,210
Once the sun comes up above the horizon, you're into your second hour.

283
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,590
So then you have 10 divisions, right?

284
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,730
And when we get down to the horizon in the west, that's the 10th division.

285
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,810
So that's 10 divisions plus the first one that you don't see the sun.

286
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:51,730
And as you get to the west, if you see the sun going down and it's still above the horizon, you're in the 11th hour.

287
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:58,250
When the sun goes below the horizon, you notice the sky is still lit, but you don't see the sun.

288
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,710
That's the 12th hour.

289
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:07,390
So your first hour in the east in the morning is when the sky begins to light up, but the sun has not appeared.

290
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,710
The 12th hour is when the sun has disappeared, but it's still lit.

291
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,470
Well, would a way to explain this be that the sun is coming up, that is, it begins as it's emerging and doesn't quite emerge yet.

292
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,850
That's your first hour.

293
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,810
Your last hour is it's disappearing.

294
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,170
And this is where?

295
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,310
Sunset.

296
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,170
Sunset.

297
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:39,830
That actually makes perfect sense to me, because you have the two transitional hours, basically, even though there's 10 segments in the sky, and therefore you have 12 hours.

298
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:48,350
Right, because you have the hour before it appears into one of those segments, and then you have the hour after it disappears from one of those segments.

299
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,790
So the first and 12th are not visible.

300
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,050
Similar with the moon, but in a different way.

301
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,770
I just had to throw that in because they're intermixed.

302
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,470
People again say, oh, it's a lunar calendar.

303
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,250
I'm like, no, it's not.

304
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,870
It's solar and lunar.

305
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:09,410
Imagine working in construction or whatever, and you need two tape measures, because one is only good for measuring length, and the other one is only good for measuring width.

306
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,910
It's kind of absurd when you first think about it, but if you lived in a world where that was true, it would be normal.

307
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,190
I suppose.

308
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,190
I don't know how you make sense of that, because length is length.

309
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:33,430
Well, they're both linear measurements would be what I would say, but they become nonlinear when you have to go get another tape measure.

310
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:34,830
Okay.

311
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,630
All right.

312
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,610
Well, that makes a lot of sense.

313
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,750
For time.

314
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,150
For time, yeah.

315
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,970
But go ahead on the, what would you question on the, because there's more to the moon, by the way.

316
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,110
I'm going to let that settle in.

317
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,690
Yeah, I'm letting this settle in.

318
00:26:49,690 --> 00:27:08,910
That's really, really interesting, though, because the 12-hour span, I never thought of it before that way, where we have one hour where the sun is not fully visible, but it's coming into visibility, and the other one where it's not fully visible again, but going out.

319
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,070
Still, the light is there.

320
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,070
I never thought of that before.

321
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,590
That's totally new to me.

322
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,530
Sure, sure.

323
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,850
But no stain on you, but I've only mentioned it about 20 times on Ocelli and the Greek before.

324
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:28,130
You see, when the time isn't there to hear it, right, there's hearing and listening.

325
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,410
And this is, I'm going to humbly say this.

326
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,770
No one ever held my hand or told me any of this, right?

327
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,710
So, I've come up with this stuff in the beginning.

328
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:43,870
I thought I was inventing it, because it just, I couldn't find it or hear from anyone.

329
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,330
Right.

330
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,730
But I just sat down, and just using logic and reason, how would you work this as a clock?

331
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,870
Like, imagine you're drawing.

332
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,370
You're the first person to make the clock with the large hand and the small hand, right?

333
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:02,210
It existed before, but you didn't know it, and you ended up coming up with one that looked exactly like the one that existed before you knew it even existed.

334
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:02,630
Right.

335
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:02,830
Right?

336
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:09,170
Okay, so I felt like I was reinventing the wheel, but I have two things working.

337
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:15,170
One is that the system is accurate, and second, the system is, well, it's conveyable.

338
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:27,170
Anyone can see it, and it's flawless, and it works, and it fits in with pretty much however you want to use it, whether it's scientific or cultural or whatever.

339
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,670
Okay, so I think we kind of interjected.

340
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,150
It went from the moon to the sun to the 12 hours, and it's easier to describe.

341
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:45,750
So when the full moon makes its appearance at night, it's going to be in the second hour where the sun was in the morning, right, because it's above the horizon.

342
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:46,530
Okay?

343
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:46,930
Okay.

344
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,970
All right, so let's say we have a day where we say, I think the full moon is coming tonight, right?

345
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,890
So you all gather around, and you see, or yourself, you see the moon rising.

346
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,570
The sun is already in the 12th hour.

347
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,210
It's below the horizon.

348
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:10,770
And you see the moon coming up, and it's kind of a slightly dark gray, black background behind the moon, but a slight blue background behind the sun.

349
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,150
There's a 99% chance that's a full moon, right?

350
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,810
And you're going to say, oh, it's the full moon, but so is today the first day of the month?

351
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,110
Yeah.

352
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,730
Yeah, okay, because, yeah, if that's where, yeah, okay.

353
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,090
Yeah, but hold on.

354
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,070
But when did the day start?

355
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,350
It started at noon, didn't it?

356
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,150
Before you saw the moon, because remember, it's evening time now, isn't it?

357
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,210
All right.

358
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,190
Okay, so.

359
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,170
It started at noon.

360
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,030
In other words, so, you know, you're quick to answer.

361
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,950
You're correct, though.

362
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,710
Yes, is it today the first day of the month?

363
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,290
It is.

364
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,510
But when does the day start?

365
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:46,830
At noon.

366
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,490
So does the day, so is it tomorrow that you mark it, tomorrow noon, or was it today noon?

367
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,530
Yes, today noon, but noon already happened, right?

368
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:02,790
So it seems like the marking of the first day of the month happens in the evening when the moon rises,

369
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,490
which is already when you mark that day, that noon, you see.

370
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:13,870
Well, it sounds similar to me to the first hour, right, where you don't have the observation of the sun yet,

371
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,990
but it's coming.

372
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,550
Very much so.

373
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,830
Yeah, maybe, yeah, sort of, but let me just throw this in.

374
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,650
This is, this was a, this you won't find anywhere, by the way.

375
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:29,110
I have been looking for a long time, and I just chalked it up as being like one of these priestly secrets.

376
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:38,590
You know how certain classes of people take control of information to use so they can venerate themselves over others, right?

377
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,010
Okay, so I classify it as a priestly secret, and this is the secret.

378
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:49,850
All of the metrics that we use to determine a full moon, which is how, what makes it full is how round it is,

379
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:57,290
in terms of being perfectly round, equidistant from the center, and how bright it is, meaning its luminosity per given area.

380
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,310
Photographers would know exactly what I'm talking about with a light meter.

381
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,410
Not the size of the moon, but the intensity of the light for its given area,

382
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,170
and that given area is within a perfectly round circle.

383
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:07,610
Okay.

384
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,050
Okay.

385
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,370
All right.

386
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:17,210
Well, that occurred the previous morning, before the day started, that morning, in the West.

387
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:26,730
So let's say it's evening time right now, and we're watching, and the moon comes up full right now.

388
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,190
We call it the first day of the month, like you so aptly said earlier.

389
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,370
Yes, it's the first day of the month.

390
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,010
But remember, the day started at noon, which is, let's say, six hours before.

391
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,930
But that morning, we went six hours before the day started at noon.

392
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:48,690
And that morning, even another six hours before that, at dawn, when the sun was still in the first hour below the horizon,

393
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:55,810
if you were out really early in the morning, in the summer, not so early in the winter, it could be as late as seven-ish on the clock,

394
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,770
if you get up and go outside and look towards the West, you will see the moon is full in the West.

395
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:09,990
But it would be in the eleventh hour position, and it would be as full, if you took a photograph of it,

396
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:18,390
and the photograph of the moon that night, that you declared the first day, they would be identical, which is an anomaly.

397
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,550
Because when the moon moves through the sky, every time it's viewed near the horizon, it looks different.

398
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,510
What I mean by that is, the day before the full moon, the moon will look smaller, not as round.

399
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:36,930
And the day after the full moon, the moon is much larger, but not as round and not as bright.

400
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:43,770
But what's interesting about this is that if you cite the moon, if you think, like, well, tomorrow night's the full moon,

401
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,270
and that morning you get up, tomorrow night meaning afternoon, and you look in the West,

402
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,330
and you will see that moon is full in the West, in the morning, pre-dawn.

403
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,330
If you photograph it and measure it, well, you wait until noon, the day starts,

404
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,870
and that night when the moon does appear full in the East, and you photograph it and measure it,

405
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:09,710
it will be identical to how it was almost 12 hours before, which is an anomaly.

406
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,510
No progress.

407
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,230
That should not be happening.

408
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,030
So there's no progress on the first day of the shadow, like, you know, starting to take a piece out of it, so to speak.

409
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,750
There's no change.

410
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,410
There's no change.

411
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,410
And actually, there's a moondie.net.

412
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,950
They measure the moon, and they pretty much, let's say it's a 99.1% chance it's a full moon tonight.

413
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:36,310
You'll see it happens in the morning at that marking, and then it stays at 99.1% or 99.2% all day.

414
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,190
But the next day, the percentages start to go up and change.

415
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,610
The percentages change very radically.

416
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,190
So there is no change in the moon for about 12 hours, which is astronomically an impossibility, by the way.

417
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,410
But it does happen.

418
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,650
It's kind of an anomaly.

419
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,830
It shows you that we live in a simulation kind of thing.

420
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,090
Does that always happen, or is that?

421
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,190
Yeah, well, for the past 20 years, yeah, that I've been viewing this.

422
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,970
So here's the interesting thing.

423
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,810
So tonight we look at the full moon, like you said earlier, and we see that the moon is full.

424
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,570
So today, like you said, it is the first day of the month, right?

425
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:11,969
Right.

426
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,250
But that moon was actually full that morning before you started your day count at noon also.

427
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,610
No one talks about that, by the way.

428
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,969
You won't hear this anywhere.

429
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,489
And they're identical.

430
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:30,090
So you actually have a full moon that appears in the west before you mark that day as noon,

431
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,130
and you also have it within that day after you marked it as noon at night.

432
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,370
So you have two witnesses, and the full moon, or the moon being full in the west for a very short time,

433
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,760
then you have the noon day count, and then the moon being full at night,

434
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,780
it seems like the moon puts brackets around the day.

435
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Like you have one witness before you measure the day count at noon,

436
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,700
then you have your second witness after you measure the day count at noon.

437
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,100
Right?

438
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,680
Isn't that interesting?

439
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:08,020
So what I do is if I use the Pope's work schedule calendar, you know how they put each day number in a box?

440
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,460
Right.

441
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,360
Okay.

442
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,200
Well, where the box ends, let's say you're looking at March 5th, you see a box,

443
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,020
and then there's March 6th, and they're separated by a vertical line.

444
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,680
Okay.

445
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,240
Right?

446
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,460
Well, that's where I put my day start point.

447
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,480
Instead of counting the days in the box, I count the lines.

448
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,520
Count the lines.

449
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:26,860
Okay.

450
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,640
You see, instead of the box, and it works well.

451
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,620
So let's say the moon, let me just go to the monitor here for a second.

452
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,960
I'll give the website.

453
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,280
It's fairly accurate, and I want to talk about it just for a little bit more.

454
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,560
It's called a moon phase.

455
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
Oh, it's a D-I-E dot net moon.

456
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,440
If you just put in moon phase, D-I-E, like die, dot net, it's pretty accurate,

457
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,660
and they give you a visual.

458
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,120
Okay.

459
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:04,980
Like right now, it's the waning crescent, 27.4 day old moon, 5.1% lit.

460
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,220
Okay.

461
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,460
So where were we?

462
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,020
I just wanted to give that.

463
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, when they tell you, for example, on that website, okay, this is what I wanted to say.

464
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:23,840
On the bottom left of that image, when you open it, it says full moon last was March 7th at 1242 p.m.

465
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,780
So what I do is I open the calendar, let's say, and when I see the seven, right,

466
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,220
I move over to the left where there's a line, a box, you know, and it's six prior to seven.

467
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,920
In between the six and the seven, yeah.

468
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,080
That vertical line is my day one.

469
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,600
The next, so the line where the two boxes in between the seven and the eight is day two, day three, right,

470
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,700
and you just count those lines in between, then counting the box.

471
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,440
So because those lines where the two numbers meet signifies midnight, but I make it signify noon.

472
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,320
Because, see, when they go from six to seven, they change that at midnight.

473
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,680
We're changing it at noon.

474
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,260
So I use the line instead of the box.

475
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,740
Oh, that makes sense. Okay.

476
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,920
So let's say I just opened up, let's say I wasn't around and I want to reference this.

477
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:23,120
It says here on the di.net full moon phase, the last full moon was March 7th.

478
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,780
So I open the calendar, the Pope's work schedule, and where I see the box number seven,

479
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,120
the vertical line between the six and the seven is day one.

480
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,600
The vertical line between seven and eight is day two.

481
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:44,420
The vertical line between eight and nine is day three, four, five, six, seven, right, eight, nine, ten.

482
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,080
I keep going.

483
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,060
Right.

484
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,740
So and that's just a simple shorthand way of doing it.

485
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,460
Because, by the way, when you look at the Pope's works, you know, the calendar that you get,

486
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
you hang up on the wall from the hardware store.

487
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,560
We're taught to look at that and each box is the day, right.

488
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,580
So it's a shorthand way.

489
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,900
You don't have to write it that way.

490
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,640
It can be a line.

491
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,200
Right.

492
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,940
So I like to create a shorthand method and I could still use the Pope's work schedule with the citing

493
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,660
and I just count the line between the numbers.

494
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,280
It makes it much simpler for me.

495
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,380
So that does put us on the 13th day then, right now as we're speaking, right?

496
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,080
Yeah, let's just take a look at that.

497
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,780
So if we're to convey that methodology, the shorthand,

498
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:44,500
so I would go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, on the 11th, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 because it's past noon.

499
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,040
Ah, okay, okay, right, because it's noon.

500
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,500
Okay, so right as we speak, we're at the 14th day.

501
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,860
Yes, yes.

502
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,560
Although according to the Pope's work schedule, third month, 19th day.

503
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:07,040
Yes, so the 13th started on the 18th at noon and was over, the 14th started on the 19th at noon.

504
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Right, okay, because of the time of day.

505
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
We're at 4 p.m. where I'm sitting.

506
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,220
Right, right, okay.

507
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,820
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,940
Well, that's right.

509
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,480
You could actually, I'm speaking, you're in the future.

510
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,080
We're speaking, but you're talking to me from the future.

511
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,320
Yeah, yeah.

512
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,580
Very much so.

513
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,100
That's why this is all spiritual.

514
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,900
It's not physical.

515
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,100
See, so when you're speaking to someone in the future, it has to be a spiritual thing, right?

516
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,240
Okay.

517
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,660
It's not physical.

518
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,120
This is the first time this has made as much sense to me, to be honest with you.

519
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,580
So this is really a great explanation.

520
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,020
Well, I'm giving more of the shorthand and the methodology, less philosophy.

521
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,220
Yeah, that helps.

522
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,320
The philosophical part is how screwed up we are because we're on the Pope's work schedule.

523
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,920
Well, one of the thousand reasons we're so screwed up.

524
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:56,820
Right?

525
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,920
So, okay.

526
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,460
It's kind of like taking a pill.

527
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,300
It's like I feel terrible.

528
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,740
My health is in bad shape.

529
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,880
I'll just take this pill.

530
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,740
The doctor said, or a doctor, remember, the doctor.

531
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,620
Who's the doctor?

532
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,580
A doctor, a medical technician said, I'll get better if I take this pill.

533
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
Do you think you'll get better?

534
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,500
Never.

535
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:14,620
Right?

536
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,440
So that's what the Pope's work schedule on the clock is a pill.

537
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,700
Just take this and you'll be fine.

538
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,140
Actually, you won't.

539
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,900
I've had experiences with people.

540
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,000
By the way, when I say people, I'm not talking about common people.

541
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm talking about your professionals, your wealthy, your upper tier people.

542
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,980
People that were, let's say, successful financially in business and whatever.

543
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,860
When you get to have a one-on-one conversation when no one else is around and they're in a tired mode,

544
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,940
when people are ready to go to sleep or they're drunk, it's hard to be dishonest.

545
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:58,080
They're most honest when you're ready to go to sleep and when they're drunk, right, supposedly.

546
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,260
Well, I've done this with several, quote, unquote, where people use a metric as people being successful.

547
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,460
I approach them with this in mind, the topic we're speaking on.

548
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,100
I said, do you feel like there's something lacking in your life or in general?

549
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,280
Do you feel like you've got a pretty good handle on everything?

550
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,040
How do you feel about life? How do you feel about things?

551
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Yeah, I've always felt there's something lacking, always.

552
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,780
I really don't know. I just go day to day.

553
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,440
One of the reasons why is because they're out of whack.

554
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,160
Their body's out of whack with time.

555
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,580
They're not harmonizing in time.

556
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,060
That's not saying the only reason.

557
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:43,600
So once you start getting the actual physical and spiritual reality of time,

558
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,660
that's just one less thing that's going to add to that doubt of what the hell am I doing here.

559
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,720
But let me ask you this because this occurs to me.

560
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,900
I mean, you're talking about successful people and all that,

561
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,380
and I'm not saying I have a lot of interactions with those people.

562
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,960
But frankly, I find that if you get somebody into a more relaxed state like that

563
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,100
where they've either been drinking or there's a couple of other instances where that occurs too,

564
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
drinking or tired or whatever,

565
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,760
I would say that almost anybody would say that something is lacking, something is off.

566
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,500
I mean, no matter how successful or unsuccessful they are,

567
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,080
almost anybody who's thinking about it.

568
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,660
Now, there are people that give no thought to anything

569
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,360
and just seem to be – a popular term is the NPC thing, right?

570
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,360
But honestly, it's just – there are some people that have no thoughtful direction.

571
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,540
They just seem to go through life and try to give as little thought to it as possible.

572
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,260
They don't have the ability to think, by the way.

573
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,100
So when that subject comes up, they have to skirt the issue.

574
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,100
Well, there you go.

575
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,000
But are they skirting the issue or don't they feel it?

576
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,460
I would just say that anybody who's ever given any sort of consideration to the meaning of life

577
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,120
or the meaning of things or the meaning of themselves,

578
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,260
almost all of them would report, yes, something is lacking, something is missing.

579
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:09,900
Sure.

580
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,880
The reason I brought up the successful people is because I've noticed most people –

581
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,380
when I say successful, the metric is depending on what society you're in, right?

582
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,320
If you lived in a society of cannibals, it would be how many shrunken heads you had in the bag, right?

583
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:21,820
Sure.

584
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,400
So in this one, it would be most of the time when I've discussed this with your more common folk,

585
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,960
oh, if I could only get a better job, I'm just thinking about my job.

586
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,660
Oh, if the bills weren't so high.

587
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,660
Oh, if the children weren't so whatever.

588
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,020
What I mean by successful is the people that don't need a job, don't have any money woes,

589
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,860
can have access to any material thing or anyone they want.

590
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,740
See what I mean?

591
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,260
That would be more of a metric in terms of the human condition than someone who –

592
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,160
believe it or not, there are quite a few people, quote-unquote, in the masses

593
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,480
that their quote-unquote job is stressing the hell out of them whether they're at the job or not, right?

594
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,460
I mean they're constantly thinking about it or if they're trying to make ends meet, as they say,

595
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,340
they're constantly thinking about that.

596
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,480
It's like that's – to me, I see that as an artificial imposition on the psyche.

597
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,220
It's all artificial, right?

598
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,580
But there are consequences for them if they don't perform,

599
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:25,880
but their want and worry on a constant basis I see as unnecessary and uncalled for

600
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,200
because you're never – it's like you're not going to solve it by worrying, right?

601
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,020
Just like you can't solve an algebra equation by chewing gum, right?

602
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,780
Right, right.

603
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,010
So that's why I bring them up and that's why when I bring up a metric regarding knowledge and education,

604
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,420
I'm always speaking about the professors and the professionals, not the common people

605
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,520
because if you – when I say the people don't know what's going on with the human body,

606
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,600
I'm not talking about the everyday person on the street.

607
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,320
I'm talking about the doctors, right?

608
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,580
If I say people don't know law, I'm talking about the attorneys.

609
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,740
You go right to what would be representative.

610
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
In other words, if – remember in the 1950s, the flying saucer lands on the –

611
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,280
and what did they have?

612
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,840
The little green men come out and what do they say?

613
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,140
Take me to your leader.

614
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,000
Right, because you know nothing.

615
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,180
Because your leader represents the state of – what state of development your society is in.

616
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,780
You'll be able to represent that.

617
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:24,440
That's what I usually say or usually mean what is the representation.

618
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,780
Okay, so back to timekeeping.

619
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,280
Do you think – okay, let's just – I'm going to back off for a – what do you think, Chuck?

620
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,360
I mean is it easier now or is it what?

621
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,880
Where are we so far?

622
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,660
How do you feel about it?

623
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,100
Well, that made it a lot more – I understand it a great deal more.

624
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,700
I mean I know you said, okay, I've said it 20 times on here.

625
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,780
But yeah, you have.

626
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,400
But I've got to be honest with you.

627
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,120
It just clicked with me better this time.

628
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:59,560
I don't know if that's because I'm honestly internalizing the idea about noon being the more comfortable

629
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,360
and right beginning of the day or not.

630
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,140
I don't know if that's something that has just sort of shifted my psychology so I'm hearing this more.

631
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,500
Or if it's – I just finally landed.

632
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,160
I don't know.

633
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,660
I feel like I'm dense here.

634
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,100
You've actually broken something here.

635
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,420
What's broken?

636
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,020
It's kind of like a new pair of shoes is a new pair of shoes, right, until you wear them a little bit.

637
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,540
Okay.

638
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,520
Well, it took me a while, but there it is.

639
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,100
So no, I feel good about this.

640
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:37,440
This seems to me like people that question it and have had troubles with it will have much less trouble looking at it this way.

641
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,580
And I like the shorthand.

642
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,320
And the idea – I don't ever remember you talking about the calendar and marking it in between like that.

643
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,060
That's very interesting.

644
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:46,580
Okay.

645
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,720
Yeah, I have.

646
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,560
But that's all right.

647
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,020
It's not a matter of – everything is about timing.

648
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,000
Another way to mark the calendar, for example, is you know how they have the grid pattern, the boxes,

649
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,180
and the number is in the box, right?

650
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:08,560
Well, if you move the number over the line where it overlaps, then your time span –

651
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,840
because you notice how noontime is in between the 24 hours that they measure now.

652
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,520
It's still 24 hours.

653
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,600
You can make it 30 hours, 20 hours, whatever.

654
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,660
But basically the daytime is measured by a factor of 12, 10 divisions in the sky.

655
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,460
The first division is below the horizon in the east.

656
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,540
The last division, 12th hour, is below the horizon in the west.

657
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:36,000
By the way, that that I just mentioned, you won't find anywhere again written down as simple as that.

658
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,040
It's just – here's the thing.

659
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,440
Even with my wife and other people, I'm a very passionate, forthright individual.

660
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,960
To some people, they're actually afraid to listen to me speak in person.

661
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,000
Like they'll cower like, why is he so angry?

662
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,600
He's not angry.

663
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,900
That's just the way he speaks, right?

664
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,260
You know what I mean?

665
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,540
And I tell people you have to be more confident.

666
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:05,160
So what I mean by this is we lack – we are beaten down to the point –

667
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,380
not specifically beaten down but society is set up that way that you're never good enough.

668
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,400
One day you'll grow up to be – right?

669
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,420
Or what do you want to do when you grow up or what –

670
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,800
maybe you can be – one day you'll be president too, right?

671
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,400
All this stuff.

672
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,400
So you're never good enough.

673
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:28,080
So there's this underlying indirect low self-esteem that's embedded in the culture, western culture.

674
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,820
Well, you actually talk about low self-esteem embedded in the culture.

675
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,740
I don't know if you know Asian culture.

676
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:34,880
Okay?

677
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,620
A little bit.

678
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,760
That's even more.

679
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,600
Right.

680
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:44,320
So I mean even now, by the way, if you – Asian, especially from mainland China,

681
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,920
when they come to the U.S. and emigrate, you'll always see the woman in the backseat, right?

682
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,280
In the car.

683
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,920
Never in the passenger side, for example, if the man is driving.

684
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:59,900
I like that for safety concerns but it's – trust me, they don't do that for safety concerns at all.

685
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,300
So there's this lack of self-esteem and I constantly tell people when I say something

686
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,300
and they're kind of jarred and they're like, you need to be more confident

687
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,660
or if they do something and it doesn't turn out well, don't feel failure.

688
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,640
Just be more confident with yourself.

689
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,540
But that confidence has to be based on something, not cockiness.

690
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,200
However, there's – I don't know how else to say another word for cockiness.

691
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,380
But that's what – so like a chip on your shoulder or anything like that

692
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,920
because the Greek says you should be more confident.

693
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:36,280
No, if someone asks you not only – it's not only the how.

694
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,020
It's the why.

695
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,360
So once you understand the why, then the how is simple.

696
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,480
Most people say, show me how to do this, right?

697
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,080
But if you ask them why they're doing it, they don't know.

698
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:53,920
But once you get the why you're doing it, then you can – you also get the how.

699
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,940
But when you're doing the how, you say, I know why I'm doing this.

700
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,940
I think if I do this, it will be a little better, right?

701
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,540
But if you only know the how, it's going to be very difficult to improve on it

702
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,240
because if someone asks you even 20 years later why you're doing it,

703
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,680
this is how I was shown, never why I was shown, right?

704
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,580
An example, another example would be like I go to a sushi place

705
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,440
and the younger guys are – actually not anymore.

706
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,580
I do it all at home.

707
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:25,260
But when I was patronizing a sushi Japanese restaurant,

708
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,580
the younger guys seemed to be better.

709
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,860
You pick who you want as a sushi chef, and they would point to me this other guy.

710
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,900
He says, why don't you ask him? I'm busy right now.

711
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,380
He has 30 years' experience.

712
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,500
Well, my answer to that was, well, there's 30 years' experience.

713
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,220
In his case, it was one year's of experience 30 times.

714
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,120
You see?

715
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,900
So you can have – so to me, the amount of time that you've been doing something,

716
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,380
someone says I have 20 years' experience.

717
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,100
Yeah, but what kind of experience?

718
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,980
Is it a building up or is it you figured out this is how you're going to do it

719
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,300
the first few months you did it, and you just do the same thing over for 20 years?

720
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,700
Where's the advancement in that?

721
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:07,500
Yeah.

722
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,500
You see?

723
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,340
You know, it's weird, but I became like a training manager at a certain point,

724
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,040
which is kind of funny considering my visual problems, right?

725
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,360
But it occurs to me that the reason why I was effective at that is because

726
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,040
I always did explain why you had to do things.

727
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,660
I didn't simply say, look, just press this key, press this key.

728
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:35,900
I did that at a certain point, but I also would say, look, this is why this is done.

729
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,740
And what would happen is when a new situation would come up,

730
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,820
my guys were trained better because they could think about how to address something

731
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,540
even if they hadn't dealt with it before.

732
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:46,400
Right.

733
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,160
Instead of just the how.

734
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,720
Yeah.

735
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,960
I mean, I know that that was just a matter of functionality.

736
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,000
I just thought that it was best that they understood the logic

737
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,720
so that when something new came along, they might be able to address it

738
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,440
if they knew how to think about it.

739
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,760
I know that sounds weird, but –

740
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,020
No.

741
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,300
It just made the most sense to me.

742
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,280
Well, it is weird in a way that with the collective, the NPCs, for example.

743
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,460
But just to go over, I mean, do you think, okay, there's a lot of talk on AI,

744
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,620
and I'm telling you there is no AI because the AI is all about how, how, how, how.

745
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,920
They program the AI to sound like it's human or have emotion,

746
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,640
but the AI has no why where people have why.

747
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,920
Have you looked at those?

748
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,880
Actually, that's a pretty good, interesting little jump off point

749
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,880
if you wanted to go there.

750
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,220
You know, the chat GPTs and things like that.

751
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,960
Have you looked at those?

752
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,280
That's what happens when you have an elaborate machine.

753
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,540
In other words, it has access.

754
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,940
It's actually doing more what we do in terms of accessing all things

755
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,720
that when we hear, okay, cognition is to know,

756
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,240
and when someone asks you, do you recognize this, is do you recognize this?

757
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,180
In other words, are you comparing it to everything you've ever seen before?

758
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,400
How does it match up, right?

759
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,160
To recognize, to recognize, you know, is you're re-knowledging it.

760
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,060
In other words, where does it match up?

761
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,740
It's kind of like every time you see something or ask something

762
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:21,240
or someone tells you something, it's the same thing as the wooden blocks,

763
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,560
the square block and the square hole, the round block and the round hole.

764
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,720
You're trying to make things, where do they fit, right?

765
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,080
Right.

766
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,100
Okay, that's how the AI works really fast, and it's fooling everyone.

767
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,600
See, with me, if you gave me the odd-shaped pieces

768
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,440
and I wanted to make it a little easier, it might take a little longer

769
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,340
because I'm going to take out a knife and start whittling them, changing the shape.

770
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,420
You see, that's the why, you know what I mean?

771
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,940
I'm going to start whittling down the square block so it's round,

772
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,100
so it'll go into the round hole and the square hole, you see.

773
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,440
So it's just a matter of speed, really.

774
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,500
It's a matter of a force multiplier

775
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,540
as opposed to something that actually thinks at this moment

776
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,280
because thinking would actually require some of those other things

777
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,540
like the why and where this goes and how this makes sense

778
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,520
and, of course, recognition again because there are many patterns.

779
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,760
It is able to do some recognition because it can observe a pattern and match it up,

780
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,700
but that's all it does.

781
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,800
That's all it's doing.

782
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,640
Earlier we started, if you speak to someone who's, let's say,

783
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,640
advanced spiritually, mentally, what they call the smart, the wise, whatever,

784
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,460
geniuses in your society, when you have a one-on-one with them

785
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,520
or read any of their personal stuff,

786
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,160
they attribute it all to intuition or mostly to intuition.

787
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,580
Well, what's intuition?

788
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,100
To intuit, it's something actually, inspiration, intuition,

789
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
it comes from somewhere else.

790
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,460
It's almost like if you're a ham radio or CB radio operator,

791
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,060
you try to get a signal that's even further away than you've ever had before,

792
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,960
you see, kind of thing.

793
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,060
The AI will never have intuition as it is now.

794
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:03,380
It has to be biological, which will eventually get into our discussions with water.

795
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,900
And by the way, just to throw something in, whoever's listening,

796
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,300
there are quite a few people interested on water.

797
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,640
Before we start speaking on water in the future,

798
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:21,740
look up a woman named Vida Austin, V-E-D-A, Austin, just like the city in Texas.

799
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,260
And she does stuff with water.

800
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,600
She calls it hydroglyphs, where you take a petri dish of water,

801
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,300
a flat, let's say, dish of water, and put a photograph over it for a minute or two

802
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,620
or next to it, start freezing the water.

803
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,880
Don't freeze it solid, just till it frosts on the top,

804
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,940
and you'll see it reproduces very closely the image that you had near it.

805
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,520
It'll also do that with thoughts.

806
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,460
So if you have a dish of water, and you put it in your hand,

807
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,640
and you think of an octopus, and then put it in the freezer for 15 minutes,

808
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,560
where it frosts up, you take it out, and you'll see something that looks either

809
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,620
like an octopus or part of an octopus.

810
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,920
It's pretty interesting, right?

811
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,120
Especially when you ask it, what does God look like, or who is God,

812
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,580
or what's going to happen tomorrow?

813
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,900
Watch what happens when you look at that kind of stuff.

814
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,400
I just want to, Veda Austin.

815
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,320
Veda Austin, okay.

816
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,840
V-E-D-A Austin.

817
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:22,800
It's interesting because I have seen spiritualists that use bowls of water, but, you know.

818
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,900
This is specifically her shtick, and she traffics in hydroglyphs.

819
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,320
Hydro meaning water, glyph meaning writing or picture.

820
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,200
So that's her thing, hydroglyphs.

821
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:34,920
So anyway, look her up.

822
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,440
It's very impressive, and that's just one aspect.

823
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,980
Just to put in your Rolodex of what water can do.

824
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:50,660
Water is one of the most basic things, and yet complex things, it seems to me.

825
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,260
Well, of course, but go back to the AI.

826
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,760
Your AI doesn't do that.

827
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:56,540
No.

828
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,920
It can't on that level, and you're not going to get AI.

829
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,660
There's someone, Jason Breshears of Archaics, and I agree with him on this that he said,

830
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,000
and I've contemplated it.

831
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,500
We won't be able to have an AI, a real AI, because we're already under an AI,

832
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,720
and an AI that is overarching and has been here since time immemorial will not allow another AI

833
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,760
to come into its territory, just like a bear, right?

834
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,020
So you're only going to get the marketing or promotion of an AI where it's really not.

835
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,720
Think about this.

836
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,280
Imagine what computers were like in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, even 90s,

837
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,620
and now what you can get on a computer.

838
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,760
Doesn't just that variance in advancement seem like AI in itself?

839
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,120
Oh, yeah.

840
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:52,160
All they're doing is putting the next advanced variance of technology that, let's say, we could have,

841
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,360
but they're not saying, well, this is how your computers are going to be working in five or ten years,

842
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:00,540
and let's not tell them that because you know how they say the military is 50 years ahead of us

843
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,680
or whatever, right, technology.

844
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,280
Instead of just telling them this is what they'll be like, oh, this is just AI,

845
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,400
and you really can't have it because it's AI, but you can access it through chat, whatever you see.

846
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,000
What they're doing is parceling out technology.

847
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,380
It's kind of like, you know, there are flying cars, right?

848
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,420
You could look this up.

849
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,600
They're not mass-produced, but they're flying cars, plenty of them around.

850
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,300
Basically, you're in a traffic spot, push a button, it flies, just hovers and takes off,

851
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,180
plenty of those around, right?

852
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:36,360
But you're not hearing about that, you know, next Toyota is going to be able to do that.

853
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,520
Never, you're never going to get that.

854
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,820
But they do exist.

855
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,320
Yeah, I haven't seen those.

856
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,220
I haven't seen those.

857
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,360
Well, they call them flying cars and whatever.

858
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,140
Yeah, but they're not going to be like, well, this is what Toyota is working on, you know.

859
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,780
So this is how the AI is.

860
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,860
It's another aspect, a variable of technology that's being repackaged.

861
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,740
So instead of being part of the normal technological advancement, which it kind of is,

862
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,540
it's being dubbed AI and thrown over to another category.

863
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,320
Just like, for example, you have super exotic cars like Lamborghinis, Ferraris and all that.

864
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,960
You know, you could, Toyota could make one for really cheap.

865
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,180
It's just the shape, right?

866
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,020
But they don't because they want to keep that category alive, you know, like the Ferrari,

867
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,960
Lamborghini, you know, that supercar look.

868
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,580
Anyone can make a supercar.

869
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,220
You can make a supercar as cheap as, I don't know, as cheap as any other car,

870
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,140
but they don't stamp out that shape so they can keep that category.

871
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,100
You're going to maintain that category of AI, which it's not.
