1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:11,600
Sonic Event 80, and here we go now.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,400
What has been on a lot of people's minds lately, according to the emails and messages and even

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,260
discussion in the chat, looks to me like there's a lot of questions about water.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,100
And rightfully so, after all, it's the element, right?

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,500
I mean, they used to call it an element.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,740
They used to say it was an essential to life, and certain cultures venerated water as something

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,020
to be taken more seriously than just that essential thing that you need to have a little

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,120
bit of it each and every day in order to, I don't know, thrive and do well, just like

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,280
everything else on the planet.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,800
What do we have in common?

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,060
I mean, pretty much, if you're alive, you got water in you.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,260
That's the way I've always looked at it.

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,120
But anyway, we're going to see how we should be looking at it with the Greek.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,900
How are you doing tonight?

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,320
Doing all right.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,300
You got water on the brain, right?

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,560
Water on the brain, the knee, wherever.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,620
Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,120
Yeah, all right.

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah, there's a little talk on every, I've stirred up the pot and what's called the

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,640
water magnetic reactor slash seminar, and we'll announce, just like people found out

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,000
through the Sonics and through the chat, Chatango, I think it's Greek-speak, right, Chatango,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,540
and double E, double E. Absolutely.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,140
It's available.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,980
Look, if you're subscribed to Rated Y, you should definitely see a link somewhere.

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,200
If you don't, it's pretty easy to find.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,700
But if not, you can always message us and I'll send you a direct link if you're having

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,560
trouble finding it.

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,200
But there are people interacting in there, and some of them have been talking about water.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,440
Some specifics lately, but yeah, sure.

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,860
Yeah, it's a place for posting.

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,660
So what we'll do is I'm thinking whether it was, well, it's going to look into a PowerPoint,

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,040
so share screen and go through all that.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,780
I may not do that.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,920
I might just do something less involved, put some images and talk and then do wait a week

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,960
and then do another one because there might be questions.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
So it'll be in about two weeks.

38
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,180
I'll post it sometime next week, the time for a week after.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
So that's just generally the time.

40
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,240
It's been a very good response.

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,580
I've gotten at least 20 to 30 people responded already, and I'm sure you've gotten a good

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,060
fraction also.

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:31,260
And so, yeah, we're going to get into basically is just the state of water, water work that

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm in right now, not from the beginning.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,700
It won't be how to handle water, but we'll do a cursory recap of many of the things that

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,460
you heard in the water episode that you had on the members only, right?

47
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,840
Some requests came up for that.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,460
So if you want to clear that up, maybe it's not on the rated Y.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:49,980
Right.

50
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,380
It's not under the rated Y.

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,960
I still have it on my website.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,180
If you sign up as a member on my website, it is accessible to you under the Ocelli and

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,900
the Greek tab.

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,860
If you are a subscriber to rated Y, though, and you would like it, contact me and we'll

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,560
work something out.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,460
I'll make sure you get your hands on it, and maybe we can include it in the future somewhere

57
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,820
else.

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,380
But for now, that's where it resides, and I don't want to confuse people.

59
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,540
So get in touch with me and I'll make sure you can find it one way or another.

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,160
But that gave us a lot of basics, a lot of interesting stuff.

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,160
But one thing that wasn't covered there that has been questioned in recent emails, and

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,320
I'd like to get your take on this, is the relationship between the science, the obvious

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,620
that it is an essential of life, and all of that.

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,840
And I think, again, one of those things that's not focused on when people start talking about

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,160
their spirituality, their religion, their laws, and everything else, they ignore water in

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,060
a lot of cases, even though water is a part of, well, everything.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,460
Even Jordan Maxwell.

68
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,780
I know you found some of what he had to say kind of laughable.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,160
But I mean...

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,140
No, the other way around.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Oh, okay.

72
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,380
Most of it laughable, but some of it valid.

73
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:11,420
But look, him, David Icke, even Alex Jones are gateways to get people out of the collective

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,260
thinking, right?

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
So anything that'll get you out of it, right?

76
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,980
Yeah, absolutely.

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,620
Collective thinking.

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,160
But even when Jordan used to do this, and believe me, I heard it many times, he would

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,200
talk about, take a look at the relativity of how important water is.

80
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,680
Water is so important that most of our terminology, most of our behaviors are dictated by it and

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
rightfully so.

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
In commerce.

83
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Yeah.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
In the context of commerce.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,380
Well, in commerce, in commerce also regarding relationships, like you get involved in a

86
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,400
marriage and this and that, and what do you have when children are born, they're born in

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
a birth canal.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,160
Take a look at the terminology they use.

89
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,420
Yeah, because of the geography of the earth.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,700
It's to travel large distances and control the land, you need sea power.

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,540
So the law of the sea, maritime law and admiralty is the same thing.

92
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,700
Admiralty is when the captain, so you're captain of a ship on the sea, but once the captain

93
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,660
embarks or disembarks and is on land, now ruling on land, he's now called, no longer

94
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,580
called captain, he's called governor.

95
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,120
So states have, right?

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,420
So you see governor and captain are the same thing.

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,560
One is an admiralty which is on land and the other is on the sea.

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,980
So yeah, the law of the sea.

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,880
That's what George Maxwell's crux of the matter was.

100
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,920
And he would show you, look, when you talk about cash, it's liquid, right?

101
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,420
You have liquid cash, you're working with banks which are the same thing that govern

102
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,600
rivers and how things flow and, oh wait, cash flow.

103
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,720
You know what I'm saying?

104
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,040
Like the words for water go along with it.

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,340
Yeah, freezing assets.

106
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,000
Freezing assets all throughout it, right?

107
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,800
The terminology used, it's almost like water and money are the same thing.

108
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:03,000
Energetically, to some degree, they should be when they're properly utilized in a way,

109
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,280
right?

110
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,620
Because, yeah, go ahead.

111
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah, but let's get into the spiritual aspect of it because I've been trying to, I haven't

112
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,620
really hammered a very simple methodology.

113
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,380
Like example, if on the past couple of Sonics, maybe the last, before the last, I mentioned

114
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,800
looking up the John Mace, like Mace spray, you know, the pepper spray, Mace, M-A-C-E.

115
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,700
There's a psychological technique where he explains that the mind only sees images, stores

116
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
images, not events and other things.

117
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,000
And those images have a powerful emotional connection.

118
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,360
So the way you mitigate any psychological condition is by basically recalling that image without

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,580
having, or bringing up the event that connecting it, finding the connecting image, eliminating

120
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,620
the image, right?

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,380
That's like an in-your-face hardball way of, you know, doing psychology.

122
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,720
So let's do a more hardball way of the spirituality, right?

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
I think people like that.

124
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,480
It'll explain a lot of the things and why I say the things that I do and how I say the

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,200
things that I do.

126
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,860
But before we get into that, I got some update messages.

127
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,500
We did one on someone who had a sore on their leg, a relative of someone who had the sore,

128
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,880
a relative who had a sore in their leg.

129
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
And I went through a whole thing about the energies and what they could do.

130
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,140
And I got a little bit of an update.

131
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,560
They pretty much are doing better, like not wrapping it, you know, the not wrapping it

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,820
has helped because I think I went over the differences.

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,420
Right. When you when you have a sore that is, let's say, quote unquote, oozing or

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,360
secreting, you don't want to wrap it tight because that's contrary to the purpose.

135
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,700
If you have an injury that breaks the skin, you want to wrap it tight because not doing

136
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,080
so is contrary to the purpose.

137
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,560
Meaning if you have a laceration or a cut or an injury, you want to immediately make it

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,180
tight because that's how it was before it was injured.

139
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,060
Right. But if the body organically or naturally goes to an area and opens up on its

140
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,100
own to release something, you don't want to wrap that tight.

141
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,500
You want to encourage it. And one way of encouraging something like that is with a

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,620
ginger compress, grate some ginger or slices of ginger in in very hot water for 20

143
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,120
minutes or bring it to a slight simmer as soon as it's not even a simmer.

144
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,660
When it approaches the summer, turn it off because the heat will really degrade it.

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,100
And just wrap, just put a washcloth in there, wring it out, put it over the area for 20

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,240
minutes, repeat every when it starts to cool down, dip it again, wring it out, put it

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,440
on. Right.

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
What I do, I've evolved the ginger compress for a sore or something that needs to break

149
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,200
through the skin. By the way, a ginger compress could make things worse if they're not

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,940
intended to come through the skin.

151
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,120
Right. Like a breast tumor.

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
The worst thing you could do is a ginger compress if you're trying to go after it

153
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,680
with a diet first, because a ginger compress will bring it to the surface and it gets

154
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,320
very messy. I think I went over that a few sonics ago also.

155
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,220
Right. And so you got to look, the first step here is to evaluate.

156
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,020
Hold on. Yeah. Hold on, Chuck.

157
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,240
Just hold on. I just want to finish this thought.

158
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,320
What the way that I have evolved the compress, the ginger compress, chamomile

159
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,980
compress is something for calming.

160
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,520
There's a whole bunch of stuff you can do.

161
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,960
What I do normally, imagine a bowl of hot liquid or a pot of hot liquid.

162
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,860
You are very Japanese fashion because Japanese like to their apprentices to

163
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,660
experience pain. So they make them dip their hands in hot water to wring a towel out.

164
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,660
Right. Hotter than normal.

165
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,300
Instead of being like that and wringing it out, what I do or have been doing.

166
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,500
I haven't done it recently, but this is the technique that I recommend if you want to

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,400
frequent, this is get a Ziploc bag, the heavy duty one.

168
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,600
The Ziploc is a brand name, by the way, like Q-tip.

169
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,380
Right. So, you know, one of these sealed heavier bags.

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,320
The reason I say Ziploc is because it's at least two mil, not the cheap one.

171
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,660
You're the heavier duty one and you just poke a bunch of holes in it.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,720
So how do you poke a bunch of holes in it?

173
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,540
You know, however, but you could use the end of a blade, but put a piece of

174
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,240
cardboard in there before you punch the hole.

175
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,520
So you only punch the holes on one side of the bag, not all the way through.

176
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,560
OK. And what you do then is you fold it out or lay out your terry cloth towel or

177
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,360
fabric in the Ziploc bag or some of the liquid in there and then let some of it

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,680
come out. So now you have the bag retaining.

179
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,060
Most of the liquid and through the holes in the bag, you know, perforations, the

180
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,560
liquid, you know, and it's kind of held together, right.

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,900
It also keeps the temperature together.

182
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,720
Right. You know, imagine a hot walking down the street on a cold day with a hot

183
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,140
coffee in your hand, get to your destination.

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,980
It's not so hot. But if you have it in a little brown paper bag and you walk to your

185
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,980
destination, it's up, it's much warmer than it would have been without it.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,860
Right. Just an insulator.

187
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,640
Right. So I just wanted to bring these little tips up.

188
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,740
But basically the the they're doing like cranberry juice, basically when I suggested

189
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,760
doing something that would be very similar for gout treatment, because this is the

190
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,860
lower half of the body.

191
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,660
And the other thing now, since it is working is it is improving.

192
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,400
It's been a few weeks to drink the teas.

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Now it's time to reinforce.

194
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,140
And this is a direct statement to the person.

195
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,600
Now it's time to reinforce those energies down there, because if the sore is

196
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,400
improving. Now it's time to start recovering the structure on the lower half of the

197
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,460
body. So the thing that I would remember, this was most likely brought on by an

198
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,260
onslaught of eating too much animal meat and the kind that is not of good quality.

199
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,580
But excuse me. So now it's time to reinforce that lower.

200
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,560
And that's and I'm going to say something.

201
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,380
And I mentioned a vegetable that I've been probably the only one on the Internet

202
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,900
pushing it this way. Yes, I am pushing it.

203
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,140
It's called burdock root.

204
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,480
You're going to have to get a hold of some burdock root and start making burdock tea.

205
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,660
Yep. Either fresh or dried.

206
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,820
Fresh is always better.

207
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,960
And start eating burdock if you know how to prepare it, which I doubt where it's

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,740
delicious. By the way, I was mentioning earlier, you know, most people say they

209
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,840
like to cook. When I came here in Tucson, you know, it's a different culture than

210
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,780
New York. And I wanted to meet people that like to cook.

211
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,340
And I kept meeting people.

212
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,320
I said, you like to go? Yeah, I do.

213
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,660
Come over. So I'm watching them and I'm like, this person doesn't really know how

214
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,760
to cook. What they're actually doing is reheating stuff, frozen foods and things

215
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,320
that are prepared and canned is not cooking right.

216
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,320
If you fry a pork chop and open a can of string beans and a packet of gravy with

217
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,020
water and butter, that's not cooking.

218
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,660
That's basically reheating.

219
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,080
Right. Right.

220
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,420
You're not really cooking.

221
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,480
So most people, when they say they like to cook, if you that I observed actually just

222
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,740
heating food up, they're not cooking right.

223
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,360
They're not on the level that they understand what can be done.

224
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,420
Right. So when I say making delicious food, I'm not talking about reheating things.

225
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,240
So so anyway, what I would recommend here in this case, because I brought it up

226
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,980
extensively on one of the previous Sonic, maybe three or four Sonics ago or more.

227
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,360
Now it's time to rebuild the lower part of the body.

228
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,240
If you can't get a hold of the burdock, which you're going to have to inevitably

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,160
will and I will mention this person did send me the relative bag of dried burdock,

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,300
which I appreciate.

231
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,100
I still have it because I have access to the fresh and I'm kind of like reverse

232
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,400
envy. I almost want to say, get one here and use it.

233
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,440
But if you can't get the fresh burdock now, if you can't get burdock at all, don't

234
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
have it. Any root vegetable.

235
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,080
Right. Because the root anything below ground, but not as much more of a parsnip

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,140
variety than a carrot. Carrot might be too sweet.

237
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,540
But yes, go for root vegetables.

238
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,240
Tubers are not root vegetables.

239
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,840
Peanuts, potatoes, sweet potatoes are not what I'm talking about.

240
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,880
They have to be a vegetable that grows vertically, not outwardly.

241
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,340
Straight down into the ground.

242
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,500
So that's that's I just want to do a public announcement on this.

243
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,380
This was a very appreciative email.

244
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,940
I like it when people keep up with me on things.

245
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,180
And I just want to bring this up as more of a of a collective, let's say, info put

246
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,540
out there. Right. So just to recap, it was a sore leg and basically applied some

247
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,340
Greek speak. It didn't work because they made it tight where it should be loose.

248
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,400
It's a sore. Right. So and then we went over the animal being the cause.

249
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,480
And then for easy Western application, get some cranberry juice.

250
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,080
Right. Treat it like you have gout.

251
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,040
You know, echinacea, golden seal tea is one of the since the 80s.

252
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,600
It's been one of the most popular health food sort of teas.

253
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,820
You'll find it anywhere. Right.

254
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,140
You know, Kroger fries, Ralph's, whatever.

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
They'll carry these brands of teas.

256
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,240
You'll see an echinacea golden to that's antiseptic.

257
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,560
So I just wanted to recap on that.

258
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,360
Now it's time to rebuild the lower energies.

259
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,340
Now, one thing I don't want people to misinterpret because it's always this way

260
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,120
or that way, black or white, not anti animal meat at all.

261
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,440
With the animal meat, it's more of the quality of the animal meat going down and

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,620
down and also frequency that Westerners, most people, let's say in America, eat,

263
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,100
eat it. And after a while, the bodies will not take it anymore and manifest in

264
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,340
different ways, usually on the lower half of the body.

265
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,880
That's why, you know, you hear people, especially Westerners, whether they have

266
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,000
colon problems, prostate problems, right.

267
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,140
Gout, things like that.

268
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,320
So anyway, that's that was it on that.

269
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,620
Let's go back to what we were before about the spirituality in the water.

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,460
You were going to lead on to something.

271
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,540
And I said, hold on. So.

272
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,660
Yeah, well, the one thing was just really quickly that evaluation is really

273
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,380
important when you're figuring out whether to wrap something tightly or to figure

274
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,960
out, you know, whether it's the body trying to get rid of something or the body

275
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,740
needs to be pulled back together again.

276
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,660
So you have to evaluate this properly to begin with.

277
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,220
I think it's worth a minute or two to just explain that.

278
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,200
You know, how are you to tell the difference between these things?

279
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Well, well, well, hold on.

280
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,140
It's always restoring, right?

281
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,660
It's restoration. It's restoration.

282
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,100
Exactly. But yeah.

283
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,340
Yeah. So if you were fine and now you're not because of the trauma, you should wrap

284
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,080
it tight. But if your body is ready to burst open part of it and release something, you

285
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,860
want to encourage that. Right.

286
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,140
Right. You don't want to. Right.

287
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,700
So that's why I've always said when you have an injury, a cut or a bruise, wrap it

288
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,260
tight. But I didn't include, well, if you have a sore, don't.

289
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,920
Right. But this is a case where it came up and very blatantly that they were doing

290
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,520
what shouldn't have been done.

291
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,820
And I and I need to make more of a point of it.

292
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,800
See, these subjects are very broad.

293
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,460
Right. Right.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,340
Well, here's the question I have, actually, is is there a difference in your mind?

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,920
Because I know I handle it slightly differently if I find that it has taken root.

296
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,940
It's trying to get rid. Let's just say you have an injury that's trying to get rid of

297
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,060
something and the root of it is more in the muscle and it's trying to get through the

298
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,300
skin. Now, it has gotten through the skin, but the problem is not in the skin.

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,099
It's lower down in the muscle or something.

300
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,740
Right. Yeah. I would get do that with diet.

301
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,300
In other words, then you get rid of it the same way it got there, which is internal.

302
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,900
Right. And it's what's called internal medicine, not surgery.

303
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
Surgery. Right. Is obtrusive.

304
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,960
You know, it's intrusive, intrusive, not intrusive if it's not intrusive, if it's on

305
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,599
the surface and breaking out, that's lymphatics, by the way, not blood.

306
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,720
And it will it will be very quick to recover if it's assisted, assisted with, you know,

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,080
warm. Right. But if you're so restless, but if you're sure is more or less rooted in

308
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,020
the skin, it's a little different.

309
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,840
I mean, indeed, diet can improve what is causing that problem because the problem could

310
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,880
be caused and stay.

311
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,620
No, no, no, no, no, no.

312
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,720
They may not improve it. It might make it worse in many cases, even when you're eating

313
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,100
better. Right.

314
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,360
Because the body's adjusting.

315
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,940
This goes back to where people want to eat better.

316
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,880
They stop everything that they're doing and introduce something new.

317
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,220
Not at all. You always just start introducing the new thing.

318
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,720
And then phase out what you normally did.

319
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,980
Right. Because the body set up, the body will adapt.

320
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,500
Right. It's the real, you know, the real most intelligent thing, believe it or not, is

321
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,280
the person when you see people, you know, for many years, some people are not

322
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,060
intelligent. As a matter of fact, it's quite the opposite of intelligence.

323
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,620
Their bodies are more intelligent than they are.

324
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,640
Right. In other words, the consciousness that the body has, the way it keeps is far more

325
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,420
intelligent than most people's open consciousness is.

326
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,940
Right. Or awake, you know, what they exhibit when they open their mouth, let's say.

327
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,420
Right. So like you were saying a while back, and I don't remember which sonic it was,

328
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,580
doesn't matter. But the thing is that, you know, when you were talking about somebody

329
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,700
who's, say, eating fast food every single day.

330
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,280
OK, so now they've developed a skin problem.

331
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,120
What you want to do is not immediately cut off all the fast food, but turn around and

332
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,140
introduce the newer, better food into your diet.

333
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,820
And then vary the quantities.

334
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,940
Yeah. So so the first day, first week, it's 20 percent good food, 80 percent.

335
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,680
And then the next week is 50, 50.

336
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,380
And in one month you're eating 10 percent junk food, 90 percent good food.

337
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
Right. So it's going to take that long.

338
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,140
Usually most severe elements, you know, things that could kill you take over to six

339
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,900
between six months and two years to recover.

340
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,180
Here's another example. Women with breast cancer, by the way, most breast cancer is

341
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,840
misdiagnosed. You don't have breast cancer.

342
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,280
I've seen reports where they said they found two cells.

343
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,640
You know, microcells.

344
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
And that person went for full treatment.

345
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,520
They didn't have cancer at all.

346
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,860
But because, you know, anyway, so I said, I bet they had a good insurance.

347
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,700
But, oh, they had the best insurance policy.

348
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,800
They work for the state. I was like, that's why they're doing it.

349
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
So you have to be savvy.

350
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,080
But for example, there's a lot of mastectomies.

351
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,980
The breasts are removed, you know, because of whatever the person usually doesn't

352
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,740
survive. If you're going to have a suggestion of removing a body part because of

353
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,540
cancer, you should and must heal it before the part is removed.

354
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,760
Then you might say, Greek, why remove it?

355
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
Right. Well, yeah.

356
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,020
So women that have a hard time or anybody, a hard time with an organ, you should

357
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,600
fix it with diet and other things before you remove it, because removing that organ

358
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,060
apart of the body does not fix the problem at all.

359
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,820
And then the person usually passes away very shortly after that, shortly meaning six

360
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,540
months to two years. So these severe things that people have, especially if you're

361
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,480
older than 30, I've seen them seen in people, you know, much younger as as time

362
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,000
goes on. You should always heal it, have it healed.

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,920
And, you know, before any surgery, you know, it's almost like I'm not saying I'm

364
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,420
against the surgeries and all that.

365
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,400
But if you don't heal an infection or a cancerous part of the body before surgery,

366
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,800
it doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't mean that the actual tissue has been removed, but the

367
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,940
condition is still present.

368
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,220
So anyway, yeah, this is a very, very big topic.

369
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,580
And the background, I've never really sat down, you know, or done a sonic extreme.

370
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,920
What we did with O and G, the container, the second episode we did the vintage, you

371
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,360
know, O and G, right, was about the body.

372
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,460
That was still very general, but basically laying out what a well-functioning body

373
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,340
is, a medium, you know, when a body starts to break down and then poorly, very broken

374
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,460
down. And then you have the other side, which is the trauma side.

375
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,400
You know what? Different injuries all the way to toxins, you know, getting bit by a

376
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,660
snake or a spider or something, which is basically drinking some of your own urine.

377
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,000
You have 30 seconds to do it.

378
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,480
Yeah, that's a big open subject.

379
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,120
And I think I've been giving smatterings over the years on it, which have helped quite

380
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,880
a few people. But, you know, there's never look, there's never if you did a school

381
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
set up on this, you'll get in trouble if you don't, you know, if you make it public.

382
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,080
So maybe something like that might be important, a short encyclopedia, which, by the

383
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,860
way, I recently posted an encyclopedia, a universal encyclopedia that has everything in

384
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,320
there from chemical formulas to how to build a bridge, 1,800 pages long, it's in the

385
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,600
chat. Let's go back to the water and spirituality.

386
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:07,860
And I mentioned doing a strong, let's say, forward presentation and really short, you

387
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,160
know, why I say and how I say the things that I do, what why maybe distill it down.

388
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,040
Well, right. And people have asked recently, like I said, you know, what about the, you

389
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,360
know, the connective tissue here?

390
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
How does this all line up?

391
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,360
The idea that it is too specific.

392
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,380
Those those specific questions really answer themselves once you get a working

393
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,060
understanding, a working understanding of the broad overview, just like with the water

394
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,840
device. Vandy was in there in the chat.

395
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
He showed a water scaler that he built.

396
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,900
And if he didn't build that, he wouldn't have a working understanding right now that he

397
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,940
that he has built it and showed images of it, a double one, as a matter of fact, water

398
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,480
device. He has much more of a working understanding of things that I've never

399
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,440
mentioned. And when I do mention them, it'll really be much more effective.

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,880
Right. So a working understanding is the most important thing.

401
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,240
So but getting the reference and base basis for it.

402
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,220
But but let's go back to what what maybe this this sonic is about or the spiritual

403
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,900
connection. And remember, spirit is nonphysical.

404
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,720
Right. So everything is anything that is thought or precedes physical manifestation,

405
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,440
meaning speech is physical, is spiritual.

406
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,080
So let's just say this is, you know, very often you're like, I do lawfully, you know, I

407
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,620
eat lawful food, clean food.

408
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,360
Right. You know what? The way the Old Testament prescribes.

409
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
Right. This, that and the other.

410
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Because I chose that as a law form.

411
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
And it is sensible, by the way.

412
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
It's very sensible. Right.

413
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,360
Many, for example, when most people you bring up, you don't dig on swine.

414
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,900
Most people think it's because of sanitary reasons.

415
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,840
And it's no, it's not because of sanitary reasons.

416
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,060
It's because it doesn't it doesn't requirement of having four legs, a cloven hoof and

417
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,620
chewing the cud. Right.

418
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,140
So. Right. So because it has cloven hoof, but it doesn't.

419
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,920
So now if the pigs chewed the cud, it would be fine.

420
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,840
And pigs, by the way, are not dirty animals only when they're in captivity, because in

421
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,980
nature, just, you know, if sharks or tuna stop swimming, they die.

422
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,900
If pigs, pigs have to constantly be moving around.

423
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,560
The reason they sit in a stye is because they're depressed.

424
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,380
The pig is a type of animal that is constantly on the move, constantly.

425
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,640
Now you put it in a stye or pen.

426
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,840
It's totally against its right.

427
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:28,380
So. OK, well, that's why comparatively speaking, if you were to absolutely insist on

428
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,240
eating pigs, you're better off with the wild pig because it's a much healthier or give

429
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,800
them more room so they don't know how to complain properly.

430
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,220
Yes. But there are wild pigs out there.

431
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,580
Yeah. Well, that's in most countries.

432
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,540
Well, now it's hard to say, but they were always they would be in the Bible.

433
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
There's a herd of a thousand pigs roaming around.

434
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,560
Right. Let's say the biblical story right where the spirits were put into the pigs.

435
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,140
There were thousands of pigs around roaming around.

436
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,600
So, yeah. OK, so I just gave that as a stark example.

437
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,000
But if you just focus, if the person just focuses on the cleanliness, that's why.

438
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,160
And there's no reference. Somebody not to mention names, Douglas Dietrich or whatever, say

439
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,700
the reason they it's OK to eat pork now and because we have refrigeration doesn't get it.

440
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,320
Right. There's many people that give these analogies.

441
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,620
Oh, they didn't have refrigeration.

442
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,220
Right. Has nothing to do with that.

443
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,380
But let's just keep that stupid analogy.

444
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,360
It's a dirty animal.

445
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,200
Yes, it has trichinosis worms and all that more than other animals and whatever.

446
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,680
But sort of rabbits, by the way.

447
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,220
But anyway, if you keep that stupid analogy, the lack of refrigeration is why they had

448
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,640
these laws or whatever like that.

449
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,840
That still works.

450
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,080
Because if you look at pork, it will be more tendency to be parasitic, laden with

451
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,180
parasites and decay more than others.

452
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,780
So even the stupid analogies, which are not the reason to use the prescribed laws in

453
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,480
the Bible, still work, right?

454
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,480
Still work. Even with the person who doesn't understand.

455
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,460
Right. The same with fish.

456
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,040
If it comes out of the water, doesn't matter.

457
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,300
Freshwater or saltwater should have fins and scales.

458
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,720
So clams are out.

459
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,880
Lobsters are out. Right.

460
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,760
Shrimp are out. Now, something like catfish, it's got fins, but it doesn't have scales.

461
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,540
Shark has fins.

462
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,580
It doesn't have scales.

463
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,980
Eel. Right. Now, they'll make up another reason for that.

464
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,620
The dummies. Oh, that's because of whatever.

465
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,320
Parasites again or other things like that.

466
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,000
No, no, it's a it's complete.

467
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,380
It's more on a spiritual plane.

468
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,160
But even their stupid analogies work.

469
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
And that's what I want to bring up.

470
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,220
The stupid analogies of separating the spirit from the material completely is a

471
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,700
stupid analogy, but it still works to separate it.

472
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,980
OK, so I've said this before.

473
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,140
If it's not physical, it's purely spiritual.

474
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,300
But the spiritual part proceeds.

475
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,940
Your thoughts should precede your actions.

476
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,640
Right. If you act without thinking, you've heard of that criticism.

477
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:03,140
OK, so the bold part and the part that I don't say wrapped up is this, that both

478
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:11,440
sides work. In other words, you know, when people say I have a criticism and they'll

479
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,540
say, well, does that make them bad?

480
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,680
I say it doesn't make them bad, but it definitely doesn't make them good either.

481
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,280
Right. So like are Catholics bad?

482
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,520
No. But are they good?

483
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,600
No, definitely not good.

484
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,620
So what's going on here?

485
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,640
You see that black and white one or the other doesn't work that way.

486
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,200
So, again, from the spiritual side, to say there is a spiritual and a physical and

487
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,380
what's the spiritual is, again, it's not a good analogy because it doesn't work that

488
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,940
way. But it works overall, just like, you know, right, like I just gave the examples

489
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:46,480
with the food. So what I'm trying to say here is very simple, is when you let's say

490
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,980
you have no knowledge of anything other than what the collective brings forward to

491
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,220
you. That's it.

492
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,080
You're born in the hospital or home or whatever, and everything around you will be

493
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,300
about materialism.

494
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Right. Do you have enough food to eat?

495
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,980
Do you have a roof over your head?

496
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,100
Right. You know, even the religions that they give you that you subscribe to are

497
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,260
basically materialistic.

498
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,200
Like if you do this, you go to a white cloud.

499
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,620
If you or if you do that, you go to a fire underground.

500
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,040
Right. You see materialistic again.

501
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
Right. It's material.

502
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,880
Believing that you're going to go to heaven if you're good or hell if you're bad is

503
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,140
purely materialistic.

504
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,880
Right. So everything you're being paid for your actions, you know, I mean, here it is.

505
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,700
How much and what am I getting out of this is what it is.

506
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,460
And that's not materialistic.

507
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
Again, it's materialistic.

508
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Yeah. As opposed to compensation.

509
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,360
Yeah. It's karma.

510
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,340
Karma is materialistic also.

511
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,560
Right. Right.

512
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,080
All these things are material.

513
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,120
So in other words, if you stick to the ideas of the collective, they're stupid

514
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,020
analogs, but they still work.

515
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,840
They're trying to create a spiritual analog without telling you everything is

516
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,300
spiritual. So what is the base?

517
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,320
What one other thing I've been saying for years and years, food, clothing, shelter,

518
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,720
food, clothing, shelter, food, clothing, shelter.

519
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,080
Oh, what about spirituality?

520
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,180
My answer to that food, clothing, shelter, Greek.

521
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,740
What about what do we do for our spiritual self and food, clothing, shelter?

522
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,680
You don't separate, you incorporate it all.

523
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,820
So when you're going for food, you choose the food based on your spiritual

524
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,380
knowledge and guidance of it.

525
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,020
Right. Right. That's why, you know, if you want to go scientific with those stupid

526
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,160
analogs that they give, you know what?

527
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,560
If I say science is a religion 20 years ago, people wouldn't believe it.

528
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,500
But now more people are believing it.

529
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,960
That's a religion. There's no they don't give evidence for anything at all.

530
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,620
Of course. And that's the thing.

531
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,200
You got to have faith in this and they change things based on, you know, well, we

532
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,100
did this or that, but we've just decided this is now different.

533
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,380
You know what I mean? Right.

534
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,940
So so let's let's continue.

535
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,640
When you make a choice of food, there is that is a spiritual choice, because when

536
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,100
you're thinking about food, is that physical or spiritual?

537
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,160
It's spiritual. It's thought.

538
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,820
Well, of course, you're choosing what you're putting.

539
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,180
OK, let's go back to one of those basic stupid things.

540
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,080
Right. They always say the body is a temple.

541
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,140
That's one of those basic right.

542
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Just what do they call those platitudes that that people lay out there and say the

543
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,180
body is a temple. OK, so if the body is a temple, it doesn't say that directly.

544
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,160
But yeah, I know. But I'm I'm going with the stupid platitude.

545
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,740
Right. So if the body is a temple, then what you put in a temple is very important.

546
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,140
What you put on a temple is very important.

547
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,880
How you treat the temple is very important.

548
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,060
Right. So spiritually, even with their stupid idea, it still makes sense.

549
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,060
What you put in there, what you put on it, these things count significantly.

550
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,160
Right. Well, they're presuming that you'll be able to make a better choice.

551
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,600
They're presuming that. Right.

552
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,120
And you're free to do so.

553
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,240
Right. So give me an example.

554
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,740
Like if you go to the Asian market, when I go to the Asian market here, Grand Stone

555
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,560
Market or Lili Market, it's real hardcore Asian stuff.

556
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,320
I mean, it looks like you ever see the vegetables they show on Star Trek.

557
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,660
Oh, yeah. Right.

558
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,720
And that's what I don't recognize a lot of stuff because most people wouldn't

559
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,920
recognize. So they know me there and Asians at the cashier.

560
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,360
And I play I do my basic conversational Chinese.

561
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,820
I basically say, how many white people buy vegetables like this?

562
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,740
How many white people have you seen buy a vegetable?

563
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,340
They're there. Laugh their ass off.

564
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,240
None. None.

565
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,380
Because you see the only one what looks like a purple potato, you know, and white

566
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,000
person. Don't don't knock that because there are purple potatoes.

567
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,940
No, I know that. That's why I'm bringing it up like a purple potato, though.

568
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,780
Average white guy, you know, and I don't necessarily mean white skin.

569
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,120
You know what I'm saying? Looks at that and goes, well, that's not supposed to be

570
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,840
purple. I'm not eating it because they have the idea of potatoes brown

571
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,120
or maybe it's this other color and you break it open.

572
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,480
It's orange because it's a sweet potato.

573
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,940
That's it. Yeah.

574
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,040
Where do potatoes come from?

575
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,980
McDonald's. Right.

576
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,120
Yeah. So. Right.

577
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,600
So there's not that bad.

578
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,180
Not that bad. But yeah.

579
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,120
But we laugh because it's like, you know, I'll be I'll be there with Lotus Root

580
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,660
and other things, you know, you know.

581
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,140
So anyway.

582
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,520
And what I mean by this.

583
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,380
OK, let's go back to the core point.

584
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,680
What how you think about things is your spiritual aspect of the thing and you

585
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,980
whatever level you're at.

586
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,620
And it's OK. Let's let's go back again.

587
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,040
Let's segue and come back.

588
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,860
What you read of the gods of the Bible and the gods in all of the religions are

589
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,240
just humans with advanced technology.

590
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,200
Am I denigrating them by saying that?

591
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,980
No, because that's actually the truth.

592
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,200
It's not a denigration.

593
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm saying it respectfully.

594
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,800
All of them.

595
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,820
We have no connection to what's called the creator of the universe and all that.

596
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,160
That is beyond anything that's ever been discussed here or even thought of.

597
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,220
So even Yahweh or all of the various other pantheons, Zeus, you want to go to.

598
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,520
Those are all people.

599
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,660
They're people. As a matter of fact, Exodus 15.

600
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,640
Yahweh is a man.

601
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
OK, so ish.

602
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,440
And I was speaking with someone who's a Hebrew Israeli and brought that brought

603
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,580
that up and he's reading and he says, oh, my gosh, it does say she's an ish.

604
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,260
Yeah. So I was like, oh, my gosh.

605
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,060
You know, but then it's like right away.

606
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,360
Two minutes, 35 seconds later.

607
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,400
No, he's not. Right.

608
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,700
Because your mind can't handle that.

609
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,580
Well, I've always found the contradiction really strange, where it's like, look,

610
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,660
you're created in God's image, but don't you dare compare yourself to God?

611
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,320
It's like, well, that's fine if you're that's fine.

612
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,080
Your parents, this is parentage created in God's image as parentage.

613
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,680
It's a totally different thing because you belong to the earth.

614
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,220
Yeah, of course. But here's the thing.

615
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,120
But that doesn't mean that, you know, it's like a complete horror to compare

616
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,840
yourself to your parents, does it or what?

617
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,500
Well, no, no, no. But here's the thing.

618
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,820
If you're here in a physical state, you belong to this ecosystem.

619
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,700
Literally, you belong to it.

620
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,300
You are part of this. It's not you.

621
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,860
You are just happen to be in the secret, just as if you transferred

622
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,600
your mind into a machine, a computer.

623
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,080
Now you belong to that computer.

624
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,880
That's where you are. Yeah. OK.

625
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,840
It's the same thing. So you belong to the earth.

626
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,980
Yeah. Right. That's why when you die, the body stays here. Right.

627
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,760
And vice versa. The body is grown here.

628
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,500
Right. So we've gone on the into the body being an upside down plant.

629
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,800
OK, so everything spiritual that you can attribute to water.

630
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's just indirectly tie this back to the question.

631
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,199
Sure. Is everything spiritual that you can attribute to water?

632
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,940
So someone who doesn't understand, let's say not the stuff that I'm talking about,

633
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,739
but because let's just say it this way,

634
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,880
quantitatively and qualitatively, the recommendations that I've made about

635
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,239
how to treat water and handle water is pretty good.

636
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,600
Anybody who's done that will.

637
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,440
Everyone has always said, yes, it improves the water quality. Right.

638
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,020
Yeah. Not because I'm saying it.

639
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,100
It's just I'm the only one that could distill it down to a simple

640
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,620
step by step that you can easy to remember and apply working knowledge again.

641
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,780
No, I'll tell you the truth.

642
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,480
There are people that, you know, when when I put up that

643
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,140
that that one sonic that we did a long time ago

644
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,160
and you gave some basic recommendations in it,

645
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,960
there were people that, you know, really were not big fans of yours, let's say,

646
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,780
who said, you know what, I tried this.

647
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,040
And regardless of what I think of him, it's not about him.

648
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,320
The information is solid.

649
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,800
This works. This actually makes sense.

650
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,840
It made it better.

651
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,100
You know, the different things about what type of light to expose it to,

652
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,000
what kind of container to put it in.

653
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,300
This was all in that.

654
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,020
So, you know, or just the basic treatment with the Brita and the magnet

655
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,640
and the zeolite things you can get easy to get some very high water quality

656
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,160
very quickly for.

657
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,200
I mean, if you go to Walmart and get one of those picture filters for ten bucks

658
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,920
and then go to the next aisle at the aquarium and get this, they call ammo

659
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,840
chips, it's carbon and zeolite for less than 10 bucks or 20 bucks.

660
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,060
You could produce out of your tap water in two days.

661
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,580
That'll taste just as good, if not better than Fiji or any bottles of water

662
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,660
that you can imagine you've ever had anyway.

663
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,700
So, yeah. Anyway, so that works.

664
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
So that is a spiritual treatment of the subject right there.

665
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,740
In other words, if you look at let's just segregate this again, break off,

666
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,940
piece off and segue it back into again.

667
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,500
We've talked about the Vita, the Vita showing up, the Kari Krishna, Krishna

668
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,620
boys and girls showing up at the Thompson Square Park, handing out food.

669
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,300
When I first had that in the 80s, it was the most delicious food I've ever had.

670
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,220
And he explained to me it was seasoned in a way that if you put this plate of food

671
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,380
down here at the beach, the turtles, the seagulls and the crabs won't eat it.

672
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,280
It's only seasoned so a human can eat it.

673
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,700
So it's cut. So it keeps your spirituality on a human plane.

674
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,780
Because if you're eating a food that if you put your plate on the floor and an animal or

675
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,220
an insect comes and can also eat it, you're on that same plane is the philosophy.

676
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,080
Right. You're sharing the same thing.

677
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,420
OK, so this is another segue of how that's spiritual, but it's also physical.

678
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,580
Right. So the water treatment, someone who doesn't know how to treat.

679
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,960
In other words, you see water being delivered to a 7-Eleven.

680
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,560
They're stacked up, wrapped in that tight plastic on a dolly, and they leave it outside

681
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,840
and bring it inside and sitting out there in the sun.

682
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,300
Room temperature and a clear plastic bottle.

683
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,240
That's just totally fine for most people.

684
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,580
Right. That's their level.

685
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,140
That is a spiritual level.

686
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
That is all spiritual, all mental.

687
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,700
Right. So anything mental.

688
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,500
So how do we treat?

689
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,420
So if you start incorporating higher, higher level practices, food, clothing, shelter,

690
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,660
and those higher level practices, if they get to a certain point now, they say, oh,

691
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,720
that's very spiritual.

692
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,880
If you notice, some orthodox religions have stringent practices.

693
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,880
Right. And I would say, let's go back to the Krishna showing up at Thompson Square

694
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
Park and the school bus handing out food.

695
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,120
That was the most delicious food I ever had back in the early 80s.

696
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
And then explaining to me, it's seasoned in a way.

697
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,440
Right. There's no onion.

698
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,220
There's no animal.

699
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,480
Right. At all.

700
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,860
That it keeps you on a human plane because other animals won't eat it.

701
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,500
That's a science.

702
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,420
That is actually a science.

703
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,480
What he explained to me.

704
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,260
Yeah. Right.

705
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,920
Yeah. It's very strict, stringent.

706
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,060
And it's high level.

707
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,480
Right. But most people say, oh, that's his religion that does.

708
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,620
Well, what's you see where I'm going with this?

709
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,040
Well, yeah.

710
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,600
So when you start going to higher levels of thinking, they all overlap.

711
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,660
You know, it's like those those books that they showed us as kids.

712
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,860
I don't think they make them anymore.

713
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,420
The transparencies that lay over one another to form a, you know, it'll form the whole picture.

714
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,220
But you can peel away the different layers and you can look at a singular layer

715
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,980
and it still comes together to make a coherent picture.

716
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,200
Right. So the higher spiritual practice, which turns into a common practice

717
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,120
that has a practical purpose just for survival on a daily basis.

718
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,520
Yes, indeed. They are all interconnected.

719
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,840
So guess what?

720
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,240
Your science, your practicality, as far as your day to day living

721
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,640
and your spirituality do all come together.

722
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,880
They are all one in the same.

723
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,580
Well, substitute the word spirituality with your thinking.

724
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,420
Yeah.

725
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,360
Your thinking is your spirituality.

726
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,740
Well, so when people talk about what's the connection of spirit and water?

727
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,400
Well, just separate. Don't use the word spirit. Use the word thought.

728
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,200
OK.

729
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,740
Right. So what do you think about water is what it is now?

730
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:28,800
Vida Austin, Vida Austin, V-E-D-I Austin, like the city in Texas, A-U-S-T-I-N.

731
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,440
Yes.

732
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,420
She's a New Zealander, a Kiwi, that talks about hydroglyphs,

733
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,480
where a little petri dish, I've done it, it works,

734
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,820
little petri dishes with about an eighth inch of water.

735
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,960
Put the petri dish on a photograph, put it in the freezer till it frosts up,

736
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,620
take it out, it resembles a photograph.

737
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,380
And it resembles your thought, or you can ask questions,

738
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,280
you know, and it'll answer it in the hydroglyph, she calls it.

739
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,800
So that is a spiritual, it's scientific because it's repeatable.

740
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,240
It's all thought.

741
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,880
In other words, the water records and imparts,

742
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,960
well, you can impart your thoughts to the water and the water reacts.

743
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:05,580
Right.

744
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,900
Right. So the spiritual side, again, I don't know how else to put it.

745
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,340
You know, I wouldn't, but here's the thing.

746
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,580
You have a qualitative thing.

747
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,120
Let's say you go to a strip mall or a food court, food court.

748
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,680
OK.

749
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,520
And you're hungry.

750
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,800
You know, food courts, they have like a McDonald's next to a Chinese place,

751
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,600
next to a Japanese place, maybe in Middle Eastern place, right?

752
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,200
Maybe there's another place.

753
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,760
Yeah. Some of them might be mom and pop operations.

754
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,760
Others are big chains.

755
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,060
You have choices right there.

756
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,600
Right.

757
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,560
You know, it's so funny.

758
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,200
I go to a food court sometimes and there's like a local mom and pop,

759
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Middle Eastern place, falafel place.

760
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
And then but the line at the McDonald's is longer.

761
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:43,660
Yeah.

762
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,500
Oh, my gosh.

763
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,000
Why didn't you take advantage of the right?

764
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,800
The mom and pop falafel joint?

765
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,720
Why? You know, you see, that's a spiritual problem.

766
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,760
You know, McDonald's is supposed to be a last resort, not a first choice.

767
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,220
So these people are making their first choice.

768
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,340
Are they are they bad for doing that?

769
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,960
No. But are they good?

770
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,940
Definitely not.

771
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,300
And they've certainly made a choice.

772
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,660
And now you can see why this is all.

773
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,380
It's spiritual.

774
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,820
There's nothing to do.

775
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,060
Right.

776
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,020
Because the quality.

777
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,380
Right.

778
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,360
Because remember when they they were somewhere else before they got online at McDonald's.

779
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,600
Right.

780
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,580
Yeah.

781
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,540
They're anywhere else.

782
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:20,820
Right.

783
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,160
This is not a joke or pun like I've done before.

784
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,020
But they're somewhere else.

785
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,980
But so what do you think they just got online on McDonald's because they kind of slept walk?

786
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Maybe they are sleepwalking.

787
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,100
But you know what I mean?

788
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,700
No, they made a conscious decision.

789
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,540
That's a spiritual action to wait online.

790
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,680
Any conscious decision is indeed an act that could be called spiritual.

791
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:43,620
Right.
