00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,860
The sonic entity known as S.H.O.N.I.K.E. ends this week.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,020
Rated Y and it is Sonic Event 81. So here we go.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,060
Greig, how are you doing?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,940
Hey, I'm doing okay. Yeah, fully recovered, I would like to say, but I'm not.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,860
Let me just give a little bit of history. If you guys are in front of a search engine,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:31,159
type in Wendy Blades, and what you'll see in images is a very voracious, vivacious looking redhead,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,040
about just under 30 years old, very physically fit, like Miss Fitness,

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,980
and she's a sword swallower and acrobat at the Paranormal Circus.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,680
And what does that have to do with anything?

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,660
The Paranormal Circus.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Yeah, Paranormal Circus. It's out of Italy, actually.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,360
Nice.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,600
Well, that's my niece.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,040
And I'll give a little bit more of a, I live a very solitude lifestyle, even though I am married or whatever.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm what you might say, celibate, platonic. I don't touch people at all.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,460
Even, you know, I live with someone, I don't make any physical contact with them.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,900
And when she came by and gave me a hug, it was a shock.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,840
If you don't touch anyone for about a year or nine months or so, right?

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,360
Imagine being in solitary confinement, but not physical solitary confinement.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
You just haven't had any human contact in nine months at all whatsoever.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Not a handshake, nothing.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,260
And I felt like this electric shock and I got nauseous, right?

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,460
And that kind of gave me this, it's all frequency.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,820
See, that doesn't feel natural to me.

25
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,240
It doesn't, you know, to completely abstain from physical contact.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,220
I don't know if it's a cultural thing.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,220
No, it is a culture. I'm going to get into that.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,500
It's actually, the benefits are incredible, though.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,380
Really?

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,820
You can do it. Do it. Absolutely.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,160
I thought it was a negative.

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,600
Well, maybe you didn't think it was a negative thing when they started encouraging this, you know, six feet apart social distancing deal.

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,160
Did you think that was a negative?

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,980
Anything for the collective is for the wrong reason, even though it might seem right.

35
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,580
It's crap. The collective is garbage and they're never going to get it together.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,720
And anyone who's listened to Greek speak and found it to be shocking or whatever,

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,980
and you listen to it long enough, you'll be like, he's right.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,380
Because a lot of the stuff that I say you could and have said,

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,740
you could paraphrase it as being said 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,000
And it's just the human condition, right?

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,140
Well, sure. But that's why I find this a little bit, you know, against the grain.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,560
It almost seems like it would be part of the natural human condition to sort of be connected with others.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,300
No, there isn't. Here, I'll give you an idea.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,240
Like an example, like more than two decades ago,

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,760
I went on a blind date with this white girl and we ordered a dinner platter to share.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,080
Immediately, she wants to take half the platter on her plate.

47
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,600
And that's not the European way or Asian where everybody just picks on the platter a little bit.

48
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,860
Right. You just take a little portion.

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,880
But if you're around white people and you bring a platter right away,

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,120
they want to take their half right away off to the side,

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,280
as if like there's some kind of battle ensuing or some kind of fight.

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,140
Or you've seen like little rascals in an orphanage where if you don't, you know,

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,020
when the food comes out, if you don't get what you get right away, it's all gone.

54
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,880
You know, just like with dogs, with puppies.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,220
If you put the food down, you know, it's like it's all gone, like piranhas, right?

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,380
Right. And that's a cultural thing where if you go to if you go to something like an Asian community,

57
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,660
there'll be 10 people sitting around a table and they all eat from one plate.

58
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,920
No one tries to take their portion completely on their plate and start munching on it. Right.

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,540
Well, like in Sicily. It's a culture.

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,720
Like in Sicily, we had these little tiny plates in front of us,

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,360
but they were just meant to catch things we were dropping that we were eating really stuff.

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,700
Yeah, it's a different culture. And that's why I want to get into.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,100
I got a message from someone who is an architect also and said,

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,260
Oh, I've only discussed Feng Shui. I call it Feng Shui, Feng Shui.

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,400
I've heard it called Feng Shui also.

66
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,940
Texas accent, I guess. Feng Shui.

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,079
I did hear that somewhere. Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,399
All kinds of things like Fox painting. Right. F-A-U-X. Right.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,640
What's this Fox painting? Let me look at that.

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,820
You mean, oh, faux painting, huh?

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,580
Yeah. So what I would suggest is it's the culture that you're from. Right.

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,160
So if let me just tie it. I want to talk about architecture.

73
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,240
I want to talk about nine star key and a couple other things.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,680
And we're going to bounce around like a banana in a monkey grove.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,920
OK, instead of monkey grove and monkeys in a banana grove.

76
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,980
So backwards twice. So. OK, so you have you know, I always harp on white people.

77
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,440
It has nothing to do with the color of your skin.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,000
It just so happens that most of them do have white skin also.

79
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,480
It's a shit culture to me, to me, to them.

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,620
They don't know what they're doing. Right. It's a very depression baby.

81
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,540
It came across post-World War II, post-World War I in Europe and post-Depression in the U.S.

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,520
This internal competition amongst family members and neighbors.

83
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,980
You've heard you've got to do better than the Joneses. Right.

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,680
That's the white people. You don't hear that in other cultures at all.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,500
It's this culture of it's all engineered, by the way, and they fall for it.

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,020
They don't know what's going on at all. They're not conscious of it.

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,440
And I believe that it's it was brought over by a spiritual element.

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,480
That is time for it to come into the earth and it manifested.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,940
That's why people that are like that are not fixable.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,720
You know, they they can be if they're totally immersed into another culture,

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,520
totally immersed and they have to stay there because the minute you take them out, they go right back to it.

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,400
So I've seen this. I've been watching it for decades.

93
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,840
It was very unusual to me in the beginning. Here, I'll give you an example.

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,440
I grew up in a very Greek family. Parents came over on an airplane, not on a boat.

95
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,520
And I have two siblings. We're about six, nine and ten.

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Parents put us to the side and says, listen, we're Greek. We're not Americans.

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,820
They're animals. Well, what? I'm like, what? I have friends that are American.

98
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,840
They're not animals. I was in the third grade, fourth grade, whatever. Fine.

99
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,540
No, you don't understand. You go to their house, knock on the door.

100
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,700
They'll have you standing at the door for four hours talking.

101
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,640
They won't even offer you a glass of water. Right.

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,840
And that shocked me. And two blocks over, I was associating with the Bono family.

103
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,380
I'll give names. Cologero, Biagio and Giuseppe. Charles, Blaze and Joseph.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,780
It's Sicilian family boys. Cologero was Charles, Biagio, Blaze and Giuseppe.

105
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,600
Right. Anyway, and we spoke and the mother was, you know, very traditional, very traditional, very traditional.

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,020
Sounds northern Italian, too, because to go with the Colosio and all that, that's got to be.

107
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,180
Yeah, but there was Sicilian Palermo. So anyway, and the other city there next to Palermo.

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,800
Anyway, make a long story short.

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,380
I told him how shocked I was that my parents said Americans are animals because, you know, it's fine.

110
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,780
I have friends in school are Americans.

111
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,020
They looked at me and they said, oh, our parents said the same thing.

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,840
I was like, what? You know, well, that's the thing.

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,760
I was thinking to myself, Mediterranean culture.

114
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,240
And we started out with this whole thing about physical contact.

115
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,000
And I'm thinking to myself, you know, Greeks generally, as I remember them,

116
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,980
they definitely were of the Mediterranean mindset, which included physical contact.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,960
This is more of an energetic stuff that I've been doing.

118
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,080
And it's really I understand. I would recommend it to anyone.

119
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,400
Like, give me an example. Walking barefoot.

120
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,780
For example, I have a problem with balancing yin and yang energy.

121
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,620
I'm very young. Right. Give me an example.

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,080
About 10 years ago or eight years ago, I did a Skype call maybe six years ago.

123
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,200
And I invited someone who was from Skype calls from 15 years ago.

124
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,000
And he showed up. His name is Abel, a Middle Eastern guy.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
And he's an arms dealer, by the way.

126
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,000
I shouldn't say that, but, yeah, it's true.

127
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,120
Yeah. And yeah, a real arms dealer.

128
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,900
And he was on sitting in the background listening. He says, Greek, I haven't heard.

129
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,840
I haven't heard from you. I talked to you in years.

130
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,919
You really mellowed out. And people on the call were like, oh, my gosh.

131
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,820
Oh, my gosh. The Greek is mellowed out.

132
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,260
What the hell was he like five years ago? Oh, my gosh. Right.

133
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,700
So, yeah, I've mellowed out a lot.

134
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,380
Well, I hate to tell you this, but you mellowed out in the time I've been talking to you.

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,200
Yeah, but it's still a regular quote unquote white people being super hard.

136
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,620
Oh, they can't. Oh, my gosh. They got to run, run, run.

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,040
Of course.

138
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,420
Okay. So walking barefoot. So I have a problem.

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,900
I'm very young, but I'll get cold feet that are wet and clammy in shoes in the winter.

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,320
But if I take the shoes and socks off, it doesn't matter how cold it is.

141
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,140
I walk barefoot. My feet are warm and fine.

142
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,300
Right. Because now I've made the connection. Right.

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,580
The bottom is the most lean. The top of the earth is the most young.

144
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,240
Boom. They make connection just like, you know, putting batteries in the right way in the flashlight.

145
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,180
Right. Alternate them. Right. Right.

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,020
A lot of people talk about this. They call it grounding themselves, which I think is a fair description of it.

147
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,580
But I'm telling you exactly why it works exactly like the batteries in the flashlight.

148
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,960
You can't line up all the batteries unless the terminals are set up to be that way.

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,340
You notice how they go positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative to keep the energy flowing.

150
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:51,160
So for some reason, if I have an insulator, socks even, or slippery, my feet get cold and wet.

151
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,720
So it works really well. But how it all came about is not relevant.

152
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:05,020
But what happens, though, if you avoid human contact for a long time, more than six months, nine months, a year,

153
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,100
what happens is you are so sensitive to the way your body picks up energies.

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,220
Because the moment you touch another human body, that is the most powerful thing you can touch.

155
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,980
Great. That doesn't sound true because I could touch up a live wire and it would kill me electrically.

156
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,620
No, no. It's not what I'm talking about because it's the same.

157
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,020
Because another human body is more similar to you than anything else you can touch, even a hot stove.

158
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,060
Right. In the way that it's made, doesn't matter if it's, you know, boy, girl, child, adult, grandma.

159
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,740
It doesn't matter. Any human is going to be closer to your frequency than an object that you can touch that will energize you.

160
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Right. Once once you are depraved of that, deprived of that long enough,

161
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,240
your own body becomes overly sensitized to the fields that it recognizes because it's no longer getting,

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,360
quote unquote, grounded by any other humans. So you have an incredible feeling like when you go to pick something up,

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,540
like a sim in the kitchen counter right now, I see a scissor before I touch the scissor.

164
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,420
I have the imprint of the scissor, all the energy in the scissor. Right.

165
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,840
Before I touch it, I feel it. Right. It makes you extremely sensitive on more than any physical level you can ever.

166
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,940
Right. And the moment you touch a human, it feels very odd, very odd, very strange.

167
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,780
And when you're frequently touching people, meaning like shaking hands. Right.

168
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,400
Let's say in business or at work, people shake your hands when they introduce and meet. Right.

169
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Right. Or spouses, lovers, friends, hug, hold, sex, whatever, whatever. Right.

170
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah. They're not used to they touch each other so often.

171
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,980
Let's say you you shake your someone's hand at work a couple of times.

172
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,420
It's put the social stuff aside and then you go home and you kiss your wife and then you have sex or whatever.

173
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,160
It's the same. The feeling. But you don't notice the changes. Right.

174
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,260
Because it's all physical. One is more elevated than the other. Right.

175
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:08,780
So if you have zero human contact at all, at all, when you touch another human, you get a serious download.

176
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,480
I mean, energetic. It's it's not like a download of information or anything.

177
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,640
You get their energy completely. Right. And it's it's not good.

178
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,900
It's not good unless the person is very clean, very well on your level, let's say. Right.

179
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,820
So it's very interesting. So actually, when you're in prison and solitary confinement,

180
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:37,180
I think it's a predisposed mental psych out to people to say that because anybody in solitary confinement in prison will say, oh, that was the worst thing.

181
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I just need somebody to talk to. Bullshit. That is total bullshit.

182
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,900
That is because you're preconditioned.

183
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,320
You were told many times when you got into prison that the worst thing is solitary confinement.

184
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,460
Mentally, it breaks you. OK, I'll remember that.

185
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,980
Then when you go into it, you apply that programming to yourself.

186
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,060
And it is terrible when I'm telling you it's not the best thing could ever happen to anyone.

187
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,760
Right. You see how you can turn things into giving an example how this is true.

188
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,000
America is the richest country in the world. Legally, it's the poorest country in the world legally.

189
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,580
Well, how do I know? Because which country in the world legally has the most deficit?

190
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,240
The U.S. So legally, the U.S. is the poorest country in the world, right?

191
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,660
Because I owe twelve dollars. My neighbor owes forty thousand and my other neighbor owns six million.

192
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,960
He owes. Who's the poorest? About three of us. The guy who owns six million.

193
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,820
He'll never get out of it. Right. So what do they tell you?

194
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,740
U.S. is the richest country in the world, but it's actually the poorest. Oh, my gosh.

195
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,520
OK. What does that mean? The reason why people call it the richest country in the world is because there's no scarcity.

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,360
One thing that people visit here from other countries, the U.S., you got everything everywhere.

197
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,600
Go to a supermarket. Get more things here. Right.

198
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,640
But except for Germany and places like that, let's say. Right. Everything's available.

199
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,160
So what what's where's the scarcity? The scarcity is in the money, in the credit.

200
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,620
Material energy is very cheap. Like if you lived in England, you have a heater in each room.

201
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,680
And when you go from room to room in the winter, you make sure you turn off the heater that you're not in the room.

202
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,540
That's how expensive it is to write. Electricity is in England. Right.

203
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,540
Right. Excuse me. In the U.S., they still have 50, 60 year old burners that are only 10 percent efficient,

204
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,680
meaning 90 percent of the money you spend on fuel goes out the chimney, not to eat the house.

205
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,200
Right. So it's a crime. They still have houses remodeled down the street.

206
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,820
They're putting that unit in there. The same one. I'm like, oh, my gosh.

207
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,460
Right. Because, OK, the reason why people came to the two of the Americas across the Atlantic was, first of all, to escape justice,

208
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,900
because justice that revived goddess religion was destroying them after Napoleon.

209
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Napoleon was their last hope. But that was a game also. Napoleon was like the Trump of the time, by the way.

210
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:03,120
Right. You know, is a bullshit. You know, anyway. Anyway, they came over here because the system was destroying them.

211
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,100
But also they came here because of free energy or cheap energy.

212
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,460
If it was cold in the winter in Europe and you needed wood for your little hovel to heat up, you couldn't find it.

213
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,620
You were fighting for sticks. If you can find them where you come to the U.S., even in a city,

214
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,760
you just walk off to the outskirts of the city like Boston was surrounded by forest. Right.

215
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,400
New York was surrounded by forest. Right. You all the logs and sticks you want to burn.

216
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,200
You could accumulate in three days enough wood for the entire winter, you see, and coal and oil.

217
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,220
And so the reason why people came here is because cheap energy. Gasoline.

218
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,640
Oh, you know, euro in a dollar is almost the same. Right. So let's say it's three dollars for a gallon of gas in the U.S.

219
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:58,280
Well, in Europe, it's like 275 euro, which is almost the same, but for a liter. Right.

220
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,260
Less than a quarter. Right. So it's really twelve dollars a gallon. You see, it's still going on.

221
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,380
So this was set up. It's all programming. It's all programming.

222
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,480
Again, let's go back to solitary confinement, because anybody you hear stories in prison,

223
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,580
the worst thing that ever happened in solitary confinement, even 30 days. Right.

224
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,740
You hear that all the time. That's psychic probes. That's there's psyched up.

225
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:28,780
You could psych someone up. That if you walk into a pink room and you're locked in there for three hours, you will die.

226
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,440
I bet if you did that to 100 people, 10 of them would die only because they were told that.

227
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,740
Well, you know, I was locked up as a juvenile and I don't remember being pre-programmed about that at all.

228
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,440
And when you went into solitary, it was a punishment that was clearly a punishment for acting out of line,

229
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,880
you know, getting locked up. And if you didn't behave like the rest of the prisoners were supposed to, you could get thrown in there.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,140
But outside, I did not find it to be something that was pre-programmed. I found it to be an awful experience.

231
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,480
It was not good. Well, yeah. Well, because it's different.

232
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,839
I'm giving that as an extreme because you're you're you're, quote unquote, your privileges and freedoms and things you have access to are more limited.

233
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,540
Right. Gone. Yeah. But if they gave you anything you ever wanted, it wouldn't be.

234
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,520
I probably would not have bothered me. No, I probably would have been happy.

235
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,560
Again, it is it is a psych. It is a psych thing. Yeah. Yeah. But this is again.

236
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,760
OK, I want to jump over to the one of the requests now with the nine star key and everything I just said ties in the culture.

237
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:39,140
Right. The reason I brought up the nine star key and I think it needs to just be brought up now and let's let it sit there for people that are interested

238
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,980
to do more research into it and get more familiar with the methodology. Why?

239
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,060
It's not like horoscopes, even though it does show days of when you were born.

240
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,100
You notice it doesn't get into planetary alignments and all that other stuff, right? No.

241
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,220
OK. What it is that I'm going to say this again, because it helps to repeat myself.

242
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,840
There were imagine an agency and a government agency, a monarchy have an agency and they assign people,

243
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,560
scholarly people to monitor all the towns, villages and cities based on, you know, may keep records.

244
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,940
And when people were born, what their lives were like, you know,

245
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,980
they keep records and keep those records going for 4000 years.

246
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,740
And you could cross reference details about the people.

247
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,240
So you did you went all the way to even moles on people's faces, where the mole was, you know,

248
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,140
on their right cheek, on their left cheek, on their chin, on their forehead. Right.

249
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,140
OK. You know, you actually interviewed the people and you made detailed assessment, you know,

250
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,720
and description of each one. And then you found out you went back, you know,

251
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,000
do you know how they do the census every 10 years? It was very similar to that. Right.

252
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,760
And they would review everyone as many as they can for 4000 years.

253
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,240
And I started noticing similarities, like, for example, like people who usually had a mole on their right cheek.

254
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,740
If they ever try to have employees or get a management or administrative position, they failed.

255
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,680
No one would listen to them. Right. So they said, OK, all the people that failed administratively didn't make good managers.

256
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,420
What else do they have in common other than days they were born, months they were born?

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,960
And you notice they all had on their paperwork a mole on their right cheek.

258
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:24,360
Should we ignore those details or should we just make a category that if you have born around this time

259
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,340
of this earth element and you have a mole on your right cheek, you're probably not going to make a good business manager.

260
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,460
Should we ignore that or should we? Was it a valid category? Statistically, it's a very valid category.

261
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,000
Statistically, it continues to emerge as a pattern. I mean, what exactly?

262
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:51,100
It's very strict. It's very, very strict. In other words, the exceptions were very few that were outside of that domain.

263
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,720
Let's say character is characteristic. That's what makes it so fascinating.

264
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,580
And that's why it's not popular. That's why it's not popular.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,460
The airy fairy stuff is popular because the people you shoot, you must.

266
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,840
The mushroom people, you must keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit.

267
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,040
All right. Because now, OK, just like I mentioned about white people, you cannot fix it.

268
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,000
You either put up with it or you leave it. Well, you cannot fix it.

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,400
You know what I see consistently here is there's flexibility, right?

270
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,840
Is you can take and adapt these facts or adapt these alleged facts or these alleged things.

271
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
And what can you say at the end is you can find a way to make yourself special somehow.

272
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,820
And that makes people feel good. That's what I think happens with a lot of these religions.

273
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,820
You're special because you're part of this. You believe this. So that makes you special.

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,600
Right. I think that happens with organized religion. I think that happens with this organized airy fairy stuff.

275
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,640
You're special as long as you are the opposite. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and that's how they control.

276
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,200
That's the flattery. Right. Yeah. Flattery. There you go. That's the best singular word for it.

277
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,520
But that's how it goes. Right. If they can make you feel special, you'll keep coming back. Right.

278
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,160
Yeah. That's which leads us into the architecture. Someone messaged me about architecture.

279
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,360
I have a lot to say about it. Fortunately, well, here's my background.

280
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,780
I actually studied architecture 40 years ago and I had some pretty good design professors.

281
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,020
And I worked for an architect who knew the system was bullshit.

282
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,760
And he started a small minute. It was called Men at Work.

283
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,580
And he did architectural projects, remodels. We actually physically worked and designed stuff.

284
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,900
And he still has a studio in Manhattan. Looked him up about a few years ago.

285
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,680
Wasn't that company that like a small crew could show up and pretty much do anything?

286
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,640
Wasn't that the idea with the Men at Work group? Yeah, pretty much.

287
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,560
But it was most of our clients were people in the entertainment industry like the Segovia brothers,

288
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:58,120
Molly Davis, who was one of the early videographers could go on and on and on people in the theater business.

289
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,140
And but not the struggling artists, the ones that would go and buy a loft on Broadway.

290
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,120
Like, remember Tower Records in Manhattan, where it's fourth and Broadway?

291
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah, yeah. Well, that building, that building on the third floor,

292
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,040
they buy the loft for two million and they spend two million to remodel. Right.

293
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,220
Right. The elevator opens in your in your loft like that.

294
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,580
Those kinds of projects, fun stuff. And we did some very interesting stuff.

295
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,600
And he was a Yale. He went to Yale. And after a few years studying Yale architecture school, he stopped.

296
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,200
He said he wanted his work in the field and go back and finish the degree.

297
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,020
His dad, if I get is a famous, very famous artist. And his godfather was Marcel Duchamp.

298
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,660
Most people don't know who he is. He started the Dada movement and the Impressionist movement.

299
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,840
But, you know, you could look up Marcel Duchamp.

300
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,620
He was also a famous chess master. The chess master community knew him as a chess master that painted.

301
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,680
And the artist community knew him as a painter that played chess.

302
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,980
He had two lives. Anyway, I had his ladder for a little while.

303
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,920
But anyway, yeah, I rubbed I was around those those high end artists.

304
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,600
Dori Ashton was my landlady. I'll just name drop to 17 East 11th Street.

305
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,040
I lived on the ground floor. I'd go up. I should invite me for tea.

306
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,300
And I'd be sitting there with like Matisse's in the living room.

307
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,040
All kinds of artwork. All those artists from the 60s, 70s and 80s.

308
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Like if you didn't know her, you couldn't be famous. Andy Warhol stuff.

309
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,900
I mean, so basically I'm sitting there having tea. And if I if she left the room and I opened the front door,

310
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,740
I could grab 50 million dollars worth of paintings out of her living room and run.

311
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,300
Right. But I didn't care because the stuff was as ugly as modern art masterpiece.

312
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,160
You expect to be right. So closest I ever got to something like that was Peel.

313
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,720
I knew a Peel there that lived in the East Village when I lived on 9th Street.

314
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,220
You know, so you remember him. Oh, I had a client.

315
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,860
The Scalamandres. And oh, my gosh, they're like the De Beers of Dimino, the Scalamandres or the Silk Empire.

316
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,540
Right. They're not as prominent as they were. I'll use names. So what?

317
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:09,760
And she was cheap and she had a duplex on Park Avenue on 56 and Park, a two story apartment.

318
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,240
Right. With a big grand staircase. You know, she's like selling.

319
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,560
So I got I hired one of the handymen to paint the ceiling.

320
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,340
There were water stains and I think he got some paint drops in some of my heirloom paintings.

321
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,220
So I walk into the room and I see this painting. It's like, you know, a foot and a half by foot and a half oil.

322
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,740
You could tell it's old. It was at least 500 years old, you know, because the oil, the shellac is really dark.

323
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,740
Right. You know, you see really old paintings. Right. So I wrap it up in paper, take it on the subway to Jennifer.

324
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,440
This girl, she's a conservator, conservator like she would.

325
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:50,420
They would give her World War, Civil War photos and very wealthy people photo albums that were 100 years old.

326
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,720
And she would restore the pictures. You see like a really jacked up black and white picture, all distorted water stain.

327
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,800
And she would make it look like it was brand new. Right. She could reverse all the processes and stuff.

328
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,180
So anyway, I bring this painting and you could see there were some paint spots like someone's painting the ceiling.

329
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,160
They didn't use enough drop cloths kind of thing. OK. And I opened the painting and she froze.

330
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,920
She turned white and she's like, I can't touch this painting. Where did you get it? A museum or something?

331
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,520
This is a such and such. You know what? I remember the artist. There was some.

332
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,240
I looked them up, some famous Renaissance painter, not so famous, but there was slews of them.

333
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,540
Right. Like, you know, four or five million dollar painting because I can't touch it.

334
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,160
And I'm like, look, look, this lady, she hired a handyman to paint the ceiling and he got painted.

335
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,840
Do you think she fucking cares? Right. Just get the damn paint off.

336
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,040
And she's like, I can't, I can't, I can't. Maybe I know someone who. And she she's like, you need an armored car to move this.

337
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,500
You took it on the subway. You know, I'm like, yeah, nobody knew I had it.

338
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,820
You know, it's like, what the hell's wrong with you people? You know, I'm just trying to help out this lady. Right.

339
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,960
So, yeah, I can go on and on and on with art stories with the art community like that.

340
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,920
Oh, my gosh. For hours and architectural stories, too. But this is what I want to say about the architecture.

341
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,080
What's going on with architecture is some of the education. All right.

342
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
Before I continue, I'm going to stop. I know this is a triple segway, triple tangent.

343
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:23,920
OK, if academics were in control of what is created and designed in the world, we would not have electric motors.

344
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,480
We would not have the light bulb. We would not have the propeller driven airplane or jet airplane.

345
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,200
We would not have any of that. We would not have the computer at all.

346
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,860
We would be shoveling horseshit, literally, literally.

347
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,620
And we'd be doing well, not whale oil, but probably petroleum oil candlelight.

348
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:50,980
If academics and I mean this, I mean this. If this is the last thing I'm going to say ever, my last words, this is it.

349
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:59,020
If academics ruled really the you know, the way society was going to go, we wouldn't have any of those things.

350
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,400
That's how bad they are. They cannot create anything. They're not creative at all, at all.

351
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:12,360
They cannot do anything. The people that have designed and built all the things that we have and we use,

352
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,380
the car, the airplane, the electric motor, the bay, I'm giving the bay even water treatment.

353
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,640
We're people practical working in the industry with intuition.

354
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,700
Why? If you are an academic, it doesn't matter any of the sciences or psychiatries or medicine,

355
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:41,400
that system is designed to take all the creativity out of you so much that you will not be granted a degree by the trustees.

356
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,540
If you ever read the diploma, you're not getting shit out of a diploma, right?

357
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,180
It says the trustees recommend you have enough credits to get this, right? It's bullshit.

358
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:55,440
Anyway, these people, they have all the creativity so pushed out of them,

359
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,800
out of what academia has been doing for the past 200 years, yes, 200 years,

360
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:10,200
that not only are they become totally blasé and incapable, that they also defend the system now, like the Matrix, right?

361
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,620
Not only are they hopelessly enslaved by it, but they will defend it.

362
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,440
So I have to say this, why? Because since I did the water, I've reached out to,

363
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,760
several have reached out to me, people in the academic field, various sciences, engineers,

364
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,860
and they have not contributed anything at all, zero, to how this works, intuition, nothing at all.

365
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,320
And I've seen this in common, I've been watching them for four decades, academics,

366
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,920
and I wanted to wait till now to say it, because it's reached the point where I could say it with confidence,

367
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,480
and it applies throughout, and it's a very damning statement, a very damning statement.

368
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,920
What I've always noticed is the only innovation that ever emerges in anything, practically,

369
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,400
is from people that have their hands on whatever it is they're working on,

370
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,940
and they decide to make progress one way or another, you know what I mean?

371
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,780
It's like if somebody's already doing something, they go, you know what, I've come up with a better way,

372
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,720
because they just reason it out, they come up with some intuition, they say, let's do this different,

373
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,660
let's do this better, and they do it, and they make it work.

374
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,300
It's not the people that are sitting there with the degrees, and it doesn't matter if it's in literature,

375
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,380
if it's in practical engineering, any of this stuff, it's always somebody who is,

376
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,000
who is the guy who brought you this?

377
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,560
It's some guy that was sitting in his garage, said, you know what, I want to make this better,

378
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,560
I want to do something better, I want to do something faster.

379
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, also they promote all this artificial geeky technology.

380
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,460
For example, the water group just started, it's called Inertial, let me go back inside,

381
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,440
Inertial Domain, and I put it in the chat, you just click on it and join.

382
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,200
I wanted to bring this up because I was going to do a PowerPoint and all this other stuff,

383
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,860
but I found out that if I do a PowerPoint and put it on Skype,

384
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,080
if you show up with a stupid rectangle, a tablet or phone, it may or may not work, forget it.

385
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,440
What I'm going to do is number the pictures and give descriptions in a regular plain Skype format.

386
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,080
So, like anybody's device will work on a plain Skype format.

387
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,700
There's a tablet, an Apple tablet, iPad that stopped working and it still can do Skype.

388
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,220
So, you know, there's no excuse.

389
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,500
But anyway, I want to get back to, this is the third tangent I've done.

390
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,600
Yeah, I want to bring this up, 3D printing.

391
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,660
3D printing to me is the most vulgar, most ugly, unintuitive, should I keep going,

392
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,280
technology that I have ever seen.

393
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,580
Now, it has its place, but when people gravitate to that,

394
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,760
that is like telling me Greek, I can cook, I have frozen dinners.

395
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,060
Oh, my gosh.

396
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,220
I think I'm one of the causes.

397
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,700
People that say that they cook, they really can't.

398
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,660
They just reheat food.

399
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,600
There's a big difference, right?

400
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,880
I ran into so many white people that said I could cook, and no, they don't know how to cook.

401
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,420
They just know how to reheat things.

402
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,660
There's a big difference, right?

403
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,220
That's why they have all these meals in a bag you buy now,

404
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,980
there's fresh groceries delivered to you,

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,400
has a recipe instructions on how to heat everything up a certain way,

406
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,360
and they're making great meals.

407
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,380
No, they don't know how to cook.

408
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,380
It even tells you you don't have to know how to cook.

409
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,820
The 3D printing industry to me is garbage with a capital B.

410
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,900
If anyone approaches me with that, I'm not going to say it again.

411
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,140
I have said it to several people.

412
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,180
That's garbage to me.

413
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,680
If I see something 3D printed that costs more than 39 cents,

414
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,580
it's not worth it.

415
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,400
You're being ripped off.

416
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,280
Yes, I know that there's a lot of technology,

417
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,440
especially the AI-assisted, and they're able to do additive metal forming,

418
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,900
little tiny particles of metal that are centered together

419
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,500
to make almost biological-looking skeletons inside of machines

420
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,240
that couldn't be made before.

421
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,360
I get it.

422
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,380
I get it.

423
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,820
But for things that can be well-crafted by hand,

424
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,900
and you prefer 3D printing, gag me.

425
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,800
It's like, please, barf bag time.

426
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,060
So academics promote that.

427
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,060
They gush over that.

428
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,980
They gush over it.

429
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,960
So anyway, yes.

430
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,900
Are they a necessary evil?

431
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,160
Okay, academics are a necessary evil, footnote.

432
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:21,760
Why?

433
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,860
We are in the unwinding of society, unwinding devolution.

434
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,520
We started off with no parentage, very high technology,

435
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,860
and all the series of catastrophes are to keep us in a certain place,

436
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,960
to not go back to that high state, right?

437
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,700
We are unwinding right now.

438
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,360
The spiral can wind inwards and tighten up,

439
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,040
or it could unwind and loosen up.

440
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,700
And how do we say it's unwinding?

441
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,840
Everything is being spread out, right, everywhere.

442
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
You can go anywhere in the world.

443
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,660
It's unwinding.

444
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,020
It's not contracting or some contraction.

445
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,500
So all society is unwinding like a cheap sweater.

446
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,040
So does academia fit in to a society that's devolving and unwinding

447
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,020
and decomposing?

448
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,560
Of course.

449
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,980
It's a perfect additive, right?

450
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,320
It's a perfect additive.

451
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,460
Is 3D printing being preferred instead of, you know,

452
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,920
some hand skills and beautiful art, right?

453
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,660
Of course, right?

454
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,620
The woke political agenda, is that unwinding or, right?

455
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,200
Yeah, you see?

456
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,480
So, yeah, it fits.

457
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,620
In other words, does it need to go the other way?

458
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,540
For the sake of humanity, yes.

459
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,500
But in terms of understanding the era and the time that we're in, no.

460
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,540
It has to go that way.

461
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,460
It has to go that way.

462
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,420
So just beware.

463
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,500
So in terms of architecture, I gave all these tangents to build up,

464
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,760
and I said I was very much involved in that community.

465
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,700
And I could keep mentioning names and people and things

466
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,160
and actually give some stories.

467
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,240
But architecture is the same way.

468
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,680
I had some really good design people around me,

469
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,220
and I got a really good sense of what it means.

470
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,660
And one of the things, because of my architectural training,

471
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,340
is why I say food, clothing, shelter.

472
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,440
Those are the three priority things, right?

473
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,500
You're going to live least without food and then clothing

474
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,120
and then shelter, right?

475
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,260
You can live without shelter longer than you can without clothing,

476
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,980
and you can longer without food.

477
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
And when I say food, it means food and water, right?

478
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,100
So food, clothing, shelter in that order are the priorities.

479
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,500
Now, what happens with architecture is very simple.

480
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,219
I hearken back to Jack Fresco.

481
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,880
If you look at modern cities, postcards, total disaster.

482
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,120
You see people buying tourist postcards in New York City.

483
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,199
They stand there, right?

484
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,080
Total ignoramuses.

485
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,080
And they look at the postcards.

486
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,000
Oh, how beautiful.

487
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,800
They're talking about the skyline of New York City.

488
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,300
What the hell are you talking about?

489
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,560
It's beautiful.

490
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,460
That's a fucking disaster.

491
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,460
It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

492
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,900
All the city skylines, all of them, maybe mosques,

493
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,260
maybe a few of them that I've adhered to certain, right?

494
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,980
Okay, what happens is you could have –

495
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,060
like I had a very good foundation in design,

496
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,060
and in private Skype calls I had spent hours

497
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,140
going over design principles that I was taught.

498
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,520
Not necessarily to do it with O and G or rated Y.

499
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,220
Okay, but what happens then is when a big difference

500
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,840
between the basic fundamental training of design principles –

501
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,120
and it's not complete.

502
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,980
It's not very thorough as it used to be.

503
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,620
When they go off into foreign partnerships and solos,

504
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,920
now it becomes all about the ego of the architect

505
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,900
to make something look different and expensive

506
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,660
because when the architect puts a portfolio together,

507
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,740
if everything is modest, he's not as famous

508
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,820
as the guy who makes like the $100 million loft, right?

509
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,420
So the architects, when you hire an architect,

510
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,400
it's going to be all ego, and he's going to want your project

511
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,220
to be as expensive as possible.

512
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,780
He doesn't want to cut cost

513
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,500
because the more expensive the project is,

514
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,480
the more impressive it looks on his portfolio.

515
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,280
Of course.

516
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,760
This is how sad it is right now.

517
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,980
Yeah, I find it strange that you bring up Fresco though

518
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,460
because at a certain point he was advocating

519
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,500
for the use of 3D printers to create habitats for people.

520
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,020
Exactly.

521
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,040
Yeah, I agree.

522
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,260
I agree there's actually 3D printing a building,

523
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,540
but we could build them faster by forming Lego-type blocks.

524
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,860
But no, the academic engineering style,

525
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,700
they apply 3D printing as a cure-all for everything.

526
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
They want everything to be 3D printed, right?

527
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Even the Mona Lisa or the Statue of David

528
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,720
should be 3D printed, right?

529
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,600
No more sculpture, no more hand skills,

530
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,000
no more manipulation of material by hand.

531
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,180
Fresco had the idea that if you created the baseline stuff

532
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,200
with 3D printing and it was all virtually the same

533
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,440
and everybody had access to all the same things,

534
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
that you could indeed 3D print the tools

535
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,400
and then people would have the time.

536
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,900
Yeah, exactly.

537
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,260
But what you'll find with modern engineers and academics,

538
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,180
that's all they know.

539
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
The ones that, if they ruled the world,

540
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,360
we still wouldn't have electric motors, light bulbs,

541
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,680
or airplanes, right?

542
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,800
It's serious.

543
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,600
And if you don't believe that statement, I'm rehashing it.

544
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,800
Go read the criticism when people came up with airplanes,

545
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,440
light bulbs, and electric motors.

546
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,680
Who was on the front line to hound these people to death?

547
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,620
The academics.

548
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,360
The resistance was the academics, yeah, of course.

549
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:24,960
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,960
But this is a necessary evil.

551
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,720
It's like a cancer that you live with, right?

552
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,300
Are these people bad, the academics?

553
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,820
No.

554
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,880
But are they good?

555
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,000
Definitely not.

556
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,780
Definitely they're not good people either.

557
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,140
But are they bad?

558
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,100
In other words, are they there to be malevolent and hurt shit?

559
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,020
No.

560
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,960
But is stuff going to go better with them?

561
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,040
No, not at all.

562
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,140
They have nothing to contribute.

563
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,220
It's all circular, back and forth, back and forth.

564
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,920
And I've seen this.

565
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,100
I've been watching this for 40 years.

566
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,680
And I've kept my mouth shut until this, the water thing,

567
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,520
because I've been dealing with maybe half a dozen of them now,

568
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,400
from all parts of the world, ages and parts of the world.

569
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,920
And they're all the same crap.

570
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,020
Nothing.

571
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,480
They have zero to contribute.

572
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
It sounds like they have a lot to contribute.

573
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,920
But what they're contributing does not show why the device works so well,

574
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,580
why it's different than everything else.

575
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,480
Nothing at all.

576
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:20,960
Zero.

577
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:21,800
Right?

578
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,560
And then they want to 3D print everything.

579
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,520
My gosh.

580
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,920
3D print me a rope so I can hang myself.

581
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,480
That's what I'm waiting for.

582
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,140
Yeah.

583
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,720
Or, yeah, some furniture known as electric chair.

584
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,540
Yeah, so the architects now, what happens is they become ego and portfolio.

585
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,020
Now, I used to work as a liaison between builders and architects here in Tucson

586
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,140
on the expensive homes.

587
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,260
And when I'd get a plan right away,

588
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,820
I would shave $100,000 to $200,000 off the build price.

589
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,700
And the architects were pissed.

590
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,240
Because now it's no longer a $2 million house.

591
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,980
It's a $1.4 million or $1.6 million house.

592
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,860
And they wanted a $2 million house in their portfolio.

593
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,880
Who cares if we're squandering?

594
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,720
We're building these buildings.

595
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,620
We have a rec room with $50,000 built-in shelving.

596
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,040
I'm like, $50,000 built-in shelving?

597
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,000
What if you wanted to repurpose the room?

598
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,680
You're going to hire a bunch of whatever handymen with hammers

599
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,100
and bust the shit up and take it.

600
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,000
They're going to charge you $800 and take it away.

601
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,900
No, you don't build $50,000 buildings.

602
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,880
That's stupid.

603
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,440
And the architect would be, who are you?

604
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,700
Where are you from?

605
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,480
And the owner is like, oh, we love you.

606
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,380
We love you.

607
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,420
The architects hated me.

608
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,480
I can't use our architect as a reference in town.

609
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,020
Are you kidding?

610
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,400
The Greek?

611
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,520
He's the worst.

612
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,000
He'll ruin your business.

613
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,940
That's what they say.

614
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,560
Instead of having a portfolio of $2 million, $3 million homes,

615
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,580
now they have a portfolio of $1 million homes.

616
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:57,940
Aw.

617
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,260
At everyone else's expense.

618
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:02,880
Okay.

619
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,620
It's ego.

620
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,660
Yeah, it's really sad.

621
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,920
And I know plenty of architects.

622
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,780
But, okay, now here's the way you fix it.

623
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,320
First of all, when you build, it depends on what the purpose is, right?

624
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,240
Industrial, recreational, what they call residential is also commercial, by the way.

625
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,180
Residential, you're a resident in a place that you don't belong.

626
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,400
That's not yours.

627
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,060
So to say that your house is a residence, well, where do you live?

628
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,780
It shows you how, again, this completely unwinding society,

629
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,260
but where people dwell in their dwellings.

630
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
I'll give you a simple example.

631
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,880
I live on a middle class, middle of Tucson sort of.

632
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,980
And the houses are cookie-cutter houses, slightly different,

633
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,800
you know, about 10, 20 houses on each side of the street, 20 houses each side of the street.

634
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,860
And they're all laid out next to each other, the same floor plan.

635
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,880
Okay, not mirror image.

636
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
Whoa, what does that mean?

637
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,380
This is a sonic event, so I'm not getting a picture, right?

638
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,420
Okay, so you face the house.

639
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,120
So you've got the garage on the carport on the right and the bedrooms on the left,

640
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,340
entrance in the middle, right?

641
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,580
You get a garage on the right, bedroom on the left.

642
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,180
Okay, and go to the next house, same thing, garage on the right,

643
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,040
bedroom on the left, entrance and living room in the middle.

644
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,000
Next house, garage on the right, entrance, living room in the middle,

645
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,780
bedroom on the left.

646
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,900
Okay, you get the picture, right?

647
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,180
Why is that bad?

648
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,240
Because remember I said the garage is on the right.

649
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,680
Now if you follow the house down to the right, the next house,

650
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,420
what's next to the garage of that house?

651
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,960
The bedroom.

652
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,520
So the guy just bought one of these straight pipe Harleys or a straight cherry bomb pipe.

653
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He likes to restore 1960s pickup trucks.

654
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,580
He has a straight muffler on there, right?

655
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,460
So now his garage is next to your bedroom,

656
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,700
and he likes to get up at 4.30 in the morning and fire up his Harley,

657
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,360
go to work at the airport.

658
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,280
You see what I mean?

659
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,840
And all the houses are like that.

660
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,880
Why should they be mirror image?

661
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,280
Mirror image, so you'd have one house, the garage on the right,

662
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,900
living room in the middle, bedroom on the left.

663
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,880
Now the house, let's say, to the right of it where the garage is,

664
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,020
instead of putting the bedroom on that house, put the garage there also.

665
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,520
So it's garage to garage, bedroom to bedroom.

666
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,500
Garage to garage, bedroom to bedroom.

667
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,640
Not garage, bedroom, garage, bedroom, garage, bedroom.

668
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,560
Yeah, I saw a retirement community set up like this in New Jersey where it was like that,

669
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,220
where you had the garages were next to each other.

670
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,680
That's exactly how it was done.

671
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,600
Yeah, a mirror image, mirror image, not just cookie cutter, the same floor plan,

672
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,540
build it here, build it there.

673
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,240
You just flip it around.

674
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,120
When you have two houses next to each other, they're not identical layout.

675
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,920
You make one a mirror image of the other.

676
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,380
So the garage to garage, bedrooms to bedrooms.

677
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,100
Now if he's a screamer or he's a screamer and the windows are open in the summertime,

678
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:53,660
it's better to hear that bedroom to bedroom than to hear a straight tailpipe, let's say.

679
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,080
Some people would rather hear the straight tailpipe.

680
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,680
I don't know, but you see what I mean.

681
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,780
I'd take the screamer over the tailpipe.

682
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,020
So what I'm saying is the architects didn't even have enough sense to know that.

683
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,760
It's not basic.

684
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,940
There are some neighborhoods that were designed like, for example,

685
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,320
the Sam Hughes neighborhood here.

686
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,000
When you go into that neighborhood, none of the roads are straight.

687
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,240
They're all windy and curvy.

688
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,880
And the reason they did that is because when the architects laid out that street,

689
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,560
they did mirror image.

690
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,140
And also when you stood at your front door to get the paper or open your front door

691
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,740
to see what the weather was like outside, you wouldn't see the other person's front door.

692
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,360
So your house is on a very windy road.

693
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,380
So all the houses are facing a slight different elevation.

694
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,900
So no front door could see the front door of another house.

695
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,100
All right, I get it.

696
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,000
It makes you feel more private.

697
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,020
You can't see through another person's house.

698
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,520
So these are very, very, very, very basic things.

699
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,160
Now, if I were an architect, what I would do,

700
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,540
instead of making the nightmarish architectural stuff that the ego,

701
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,700
it's all ego, look what I built and how expensive it was.

702
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,740
If I were going to a city, town, whatever, and build something,

703
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,940
let's say a new mall or a new building, it doesn't matter what it is.

704
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,580
I'm going to see what's in the surrounding area I already built,

705
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,780
and I'm going to copy that.

706
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,700
And what I'm building is going to have a very similar facade, right?

707
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,220
Almost exact, almost make it the same looking,

708
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,500
as if I've just copied that building that was there 50 years ago.

709
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,480
But I won't just copy it.

710
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,260
I'm going to fix all the mistakes and improve it.

711
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,380
So when I build my structure, and my structure is built,

712
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,280
it doesn't look like anything was built, right?

713
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,480
New, no eyesore, no ego, no, right?

714
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,000
It'll look like it was always there.

715
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,360
Like, for instance, if you've got a lot of things in the neighborhood

716
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,060
that are brick-faced, right, you're going to make sure it's got a brick face.

717
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,620
This kind of thing.

718
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,000
Sort of.

719
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,740
You might want it.

720
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,220
It depends.

721
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,680
It depends.

722
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,940
If you have too many brick faces,

723
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,980
and the lines of the bricks line up too much,

724
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,660
you're going to feel like you're in a prison wall.

725
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,280
So you might want to break it, right?

726
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,380
To give you an example,

727
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,740
when I sit in the living room and eat,

728
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,480
I put a TV on with YouTube,

729
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,060
and I usually put in what we're eating or topic or whatever on YouTube

730
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,340
and watch that as a background.

731
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,880
And the architecture came up.

732
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,580
Frank Lloyd Wright.

733
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:15,900
What?

734
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,040
Some ugly shit.

735
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,040
Ugly garbage.

736
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,780
Oh, he's working with nature.

737
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,620
Are you joking?

738
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,560
If you look at the, you know, I mean, yes, I understand, you know,

739
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,300
he believed in designing the furniture and all that.

740
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,760
That stuff is ugly.

741
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,660
Tear it down.

742
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,540
It's got terrible roof lines and leaks.

743
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,820
The stuff that they're telling you as classics is junk.

744
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,780
Just look at it.

745
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,760
How does it make you feel, right?

746
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,240
Like when you first were young and you saw what they called modern art,

747
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,280
what was the feeling you got?

748
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,080
Repulsed, right?

749
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,400
But later on you didn't mind it because you didn't want to sound weird.

750
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,100
So you had to say it was, you know, okay, just like everybody else.

751
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,660
You see what I mean about how the psychic gets psyched out into it?

752
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,980
So the architecture, you know, the architecture is very much like this.

753
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,020
It's not, okay, I'll use this as a metaphor.

754
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,660
You know, in cliche, you know,

755
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,660
first of all everything they tell the collective is untrue.

756
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,060
You know, like they give you a cliche that the collective uses.

757
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,080
It's the oldest profession, right?

758
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,920
And what do they say?

759
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,520
That's prostitution, right?

760
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,220
Prostitution is the oldest profession, yeah, right.

761
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,820
Yeah, that's what they say, but it's not true.

762
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,300
The oldest profession is mining.

763
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,840
But use your head anyway.

764
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,940
How is that going to be the oldest profession?

765
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,900
Somebody had to have something to trade for that.

766
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,700
It can't be the oldest profession.

767
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,840
Yeah, exactly.

768
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,860
So in other words, you can't even do agriculture without mining

769
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,120
because in order to cut wood you need metal.

770
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,700
If you were just limited to wood to cut wood, you're not going to get –

771
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,880
you're just limited to a bunch of organic shapes

772
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,140
and the people that show up first are going to get the best shapes

773
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,080
and you've got to wait 30 years for something else to maybe grow in that shape.

774
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,020
You need to find surface metal material and hard substances,

775
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,100
obsidian, stone, glass, natural forms of glass, metals,

776
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,380
and start making tools.

777
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,980
The oldest profession is tool making for humans, right?

778
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,440
And then it goes on from there.

779
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,120
Then it's agriculture and then maybe what they say.

780
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,380
But the collective is fine with that.

781
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,000
Like what came first, the chicken or the egg?

782
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,720
Again, stupid.

783
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,200
The chicken came first, dummy.

784
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,040
Of course.

785
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,720
Oh, here's an egg.

786
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,960
I don't know what it's going to be.

787
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,480
Bullshit.

788
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,420
Everything reproduces after its own kind.

789
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,020
So all these things they put out.

790
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,420
Okay, so I can keep going with those analogies.

791
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,640
Architecture is an analogy of the collective.

792
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,080
It's supposed to be design, beauty, and all that, and it's ugly chaos.

793
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,500
Ego and money.

794
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:41,760
And things that I talked about tonight, you could find a lot of videos.

795
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,540
There's over 5 million videos at least or websites or whatever we're talking about

796
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,780
or pages on how modern architecture is ugly as sin.

797
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,940
There's more of that than there is that it's not.

798
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,780
There's a massive social outrage against architecture for the past 30 years,

799
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,800
massive outrage.

800
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,880
And then no one's listening.

801
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,160
Now, nothing's being done because it's the decline of a society.

802
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,640
It's an unwinding society.
