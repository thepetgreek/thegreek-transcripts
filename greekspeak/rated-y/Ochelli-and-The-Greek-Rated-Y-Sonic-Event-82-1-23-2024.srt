1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,600
82 rated Y. I'm running out of cigarettes, but it is what it is. Hopefully you're doing

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,600
good, Greg. How are you? I'm okay. I've got a cigarette lit right now and I'm making some

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:28,840
coffee. Nice. It's around 8.15 Tucson PM on the wind-up toy. And yeah, we'll get into a

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,980
few things, a few things I've been mentioning lately. I just want to thank anyone who showed

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,440
up at the water seminar. It was fun. And to talk about it, like I said, year, years ago,

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,960
months ago, I was asked to not talk about it for a little while by a bunch of typical corporate

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,980
cutout morons. And we're probably listening to, and I just gave up on them. And it's good

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,600
to drop what I call dead weight in your life. Even if you keep dropping people through your

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,400
life relationships all your life, it's fine. If they're determined to be dead weight, right?

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,500
You know what I mean by dead weight? Oh yeah, absolutely. Dead, dead, dead weight is a very

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:17,680
relatable concept. I don't have many friends. Let's say, Oh my gosh. F R E N D Z with a

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:27,300
capital D is how I spell friends. F R E N D Z. Okay. Capital D Y. Yeah. Why? Oh my gosh.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,420
First of all, it's planet earth. You have any human friends, you not too smart. First of all,

14
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,820
you know, you know, outside of this world, I tell people you've been here more than a,

15
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,500
excuse me, a week or so. You know, the humans, okay. You don't have to go. Okay. I'm not going

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,140
to go down that route. If you read the ancient Ritz, any of the holy books, humans are ahead in

17
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,720
a very, very negative light. The entire collective, except with some exception. You have a few good

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,040
ones here and there, but generally they are not a good group. You could say it all this way. Are

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,500
they bad? No, but are they good? Definitely not good at all. So yeah. So now what were you saying

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,620
about friends? You want to make friends with this type of unit? Oh my gosh. I feel a little

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,820
lonely sometimes. You sound like a Hallmark card. I've been telling that to people. It's like,

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,200
you want to talk to me like the rest of the collective, like a Hallmark. You know what I do

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,120
cards? You know, I'm going to do that to you. No, I look, I don't bother with them. I'm just

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,360
saying it's just, I don't know. It just feels like there should be some level of, you know,

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,180
even if it's a small, this is earth and get over it. But when I say it meets earth, it's more than

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,980
just what people want to call it, not what NASA calls it, whatever. It's a, it's a place where

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,960
everyone has congealed and conjoined and whatever. Right? That's what I want to get into.

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,580
Lately. I brought up the notion that society, just like anything, any universal movement,

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,040
you have the contractive formative, and then you have the expansive destructive,

30
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,520
right? But it works both ways. Now we are in the expansive destructive part of society. It's not

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,340
doomsday ship by the way. A lot of people say all this doomsday stuff. That's like the real simple

32
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,780
mind. The NPC it's, you know, and if you say, if it's not doomsday, what do you want to talk

33
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,900
about? Right? Your future, like you have a future, you freaking moron. Don't you know that go, go

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,260
back to the 1950s, 1930s or whatever. And when they show you how your future is going to be in

35
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,100
the year 2000 with flying cars and hotels on the moon, do you have any of that jerk off? No,

36
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,300
you don't. You never will. You know, the NPC that, you know, that's the, and then, oh, well,

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:44,240
you know, so it's not doomsday. It's the cycle. It's a universal cycle. It's, it's welcomed. And

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,020
actually, it doesn't matter if you welcome it or it happens anyway. It's a cycle. But you know,

39
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:56,800
how I brought up? Well, I was just like, stop. Not how I brought up how I keep bringing up the

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,340
concept of yin and yang still haven't figured out another terminology for yin being expansive and

41
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,200
yang being contractive, for example. But what I what I brought up recently is the front of the

42
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,020
body is the yang part in the back is the yin. And I was watching something short about meditation

43
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,220
and cheat. And they're like, well, the yin energy runs across the front of the body and the yang

44
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,140
energy runs up the back of the body. Of course. Why? Why would the yang energy go to the back

45
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,480
because that's the yin side, right? And why does the yang the yin energy go to the front of the

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,660
body? Because that's the yang side. Okay, so when it's all like the batteries, the way you set up

47
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,200
batteries in the flashlight, you just keep looking where the plus and minuses are, right? That

48
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,400
depends on the configuration. Sometimes they have them all in the same direction. And they do the

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,140
twisting and turning and cross polarity on the bracket or whatever. But what I'm trying to say

50
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,260
here is society unraveling. Imagine a spiral expanding and dissipating on the edges. We're on

51
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,660
the edges, like the arm, the outer arm, right? Okay, so because of the general tendency,

52
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,800
the universal general tendency of this expansion, it's classified as yin. But to counterbalance

53
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,420
that by necessity, by the Greek word for necessity is anangi. And it doesn't really

54
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,440
translate very well to necessity directly. It means actually does translate pretty well.

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,360
But when you use the term necessity, it means like you have no way out. It's exactly how it

56
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,280
is. There's a lot of terms in Greek that are not open or poor persuasive or presumptive,

57
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,860
like in English, when you say a necessity means there's nothing anyone can do about it.

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,220
So as the society of the spiral is expanding out, it's considered yin. So that means that

59
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,700
in order to balance that type of yin condition, you will have what? Yang manifestations in that

60
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,640
society. So what is a young manifestation in society while it's coming apart? Yang is

61
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:03,420
contractive, right? So let's look at it the opposite way. When you have a society forming,

62
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,500
and that spiral is contracting and forming, it's yang. And in order to balance that by necessity,

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,600
you will have yin manifestations in that society, expansive. So let's look at it that way. First,

64
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,220
you have, let's say, a time in history where the universe is contracting and forming society,

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,520
very young. To balance that, you have yin manifestations, things that are expanding,

66
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,000
right, to balance out. So as the society is forming, what do you see? Agriculture expanding

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,240
instead of little gardens. Now you see these massive agricultural fields, expansion, right?

68
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,340
And more abundance of food, yin abundance, right? Okay, so in a contractive society,

69
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,360
I mean, an expansive society, where it's dissipating now, like smoke dissipating out

70
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,420
of a room, there are going to be yang manifestations, contractions. So

71
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,880
where you once had wide, vast farming, fertile, lots of production, it's going to become yang.

72
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,200
Fertile lands are going to go away, and the food production will be absolute, almost down to zero.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Wow, you could figure all that out by understanding yin and yang. Damn sure,

74
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:17,300
you can, right? And it goes on and on and on and on. Population expanding, is that yin or yang?

75
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,020
That's yin. So as the society disbands, what happens to the population? It becomes yang,

76
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,680
contracts, fewer people. Wow, you could figure all that out with just yin and yang?

77
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,540
Absolutely. You go on and on with every aspect of everything, down to the atom,

78
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,820
down to social affairs, psychology, biology, on and on and on. Once you understand these principles,

79
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,700
someone can approach you with a list, let's say a book of a quarter of a million pages,

80
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,740
with two million chapters, right? And 5,000 subjects, and you will have the correct answer

81
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,620
for everyone, everyone without fail, if you apply this principle that I just mentioned.

82
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,960
But you must be able to diagnose each aspect of each question,

83
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,820
is it yin or is it yang? Is it yin posing, or yang posing? Is it yin ready to manifest,

84
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,140
or yin has already manifested? So you have to understand the condition, both the cross-section,

85
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,440
what is actually happening right now, and what is about to happen. And you will answer everything

86
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,840
correctly, and you will be able to actually create, look at something like the periodic table,

87
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,480
and see where there are missing elements that have not been discovered yet, and describe what

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,520
these elements, what the properties will be, without even knowing about them, that they

89
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,900
haven't come into existence yet. And you'll be quite accurate, you see? Well, that part I don't

90
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,740
quite understand, but I am understanding that when you have something that is in its expansive

91
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,500
state, it's going to move toward the other direction, that is the pull, right? So when

92
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,140
the movement itself is going toward the other thing, that's just the way it is. It's going

93
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,260
one way or the other, that's the way it's moving. In cycles, yeah, and that's time cycles depending

94
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,620
on the distance covered, because remember time, people say there's no time, that's correct,

95
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,040
but you ask them to describe why, and they shrug their shoulders, because they heard it from

96
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,200
someone else. There is no time without distance, and meaning if there is no movement, there is no

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,260
time, and there is no time if no one records it. A very perfect example is you go to bed at night,

98
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
you wake up in the morning, how much time went by? Oh, I feel like I got eight hours. No,

99
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,100
are you sure? Because you can have a good nap, you can have a good nap after a good blowjob,

100
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,820
what did I just say? And to have a 20-minute nap and feel like you slept for eight hours,

101
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,960
right? Or you can sleep for eight hours and feel like you just shut your eyes, either way, yeah.

102
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah, there's no sense of time there. Someone must measure it. What do you do? You look over

103
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,760
to the wind-up toy or the digital clock? Let me see, I went to bed at 10, and at 6, yeah, I went to sleep for

104
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,980
eight hours. Right, you measure it. Ah, you measure it, but if you don't, you don't know. But if there

105
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:10,200
is no distance, no movement, there is no time. So this is not evolved, by the way, this is a very,

106
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,320
if you can distill everything down to its simplest form, not only is it going to be

107
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,280
its simplest form, it's also going to be its what? Its truest form.

108
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,620
Well, it's easiest to communicate it as well, because you're not going into all these complexities

109
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,100
where you have language, which starts to confuse things, like you were saying.

110
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,260
Right, which is a technology, yeah. Language is a technology.

111
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,040
When you were saying, what was the Greek word you were trying to, you were saying is...

112
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,380
Anangi, necessity. Necessity is anangi.

113
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,020
I was thinking to myself, it's more like certainty than necessity, but...

114
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,780
Yeah, but it's a necessity, because anangi, that term is used as a proposition, like when you're

115
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,600
talking about something, and then you're ready to, because of this, then that, right?

116
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,720
Okay. And then when you, before you go into,

117
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,980
because of cause and effect, you're leading the person in that, because of this cause,

118
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,240
you cannot escape this effect, right? Which is very true in many cases.

119
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,280
Yeah, still, to me, leads more to what I would say is a certainty, but...

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,220
Right, these are certainties, yeah, and requirements based on the universe we live in

121
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,580
and perceive, more like the universe we perceive. Like, you know, the standard kind of like,

122
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,920
here's your expected reaction, and you've narrowed it down very much so,

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,240
because this is the action we should use. Okay.

124
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Well, there's different, if the people are programmed to not observe and get,

125
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,820
there's a difference between reacting and responding.

126
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, if you don't know what happens when you light something on fire, okay,

127
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,120
yeah, it could be a surprise, all right? Other times...

128
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,540
Well, no, no, in other words, people have predetermined responses to things.

129
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,180
I was in a long conversation earlier with someone regarding technology,

130
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,780
and when I show people things, you know, I was telling them, basically, I sound pretty,

131
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,280
like, full of myself when I explain these things, and I'm not, because what I'm really full of

132
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,320
myself is my passion to go ahead and move forward and do something with it, not the thing itself.

133
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,780
Like, I would never take credit for anything that people think I've come up with,

134
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,900
but I take a lot of credit for my passion and drive to achieve it, make it happen.

135
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,580
That's a big difference there. And when I show it to people, and I say,

136
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,060
make this or build this, and they're like, no way, I'm like, what do you mean?

137
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,540
I just told you to make it and build it. You looked at it for half a second,

138
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,980
you're saying, no way. How did you formulate the no way?

139
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,500
Where did that come from? You mean you process the entire thing

140
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,620
in one third of a second, and you said, no way? Or is that some pre-formulated response that was

141
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,000
stuck in your head by the collective? That you just say it by habit without thinking of it,

142
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,380
you just slap hack. Imagine like you're going around town and people are waiting at the bus stop,

143
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,600
right? You know how the bus stop has rails and guards and posts and, you know, stuff like that.

144
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,060
So can you imagine when the bus pulls over and the door opens, suddenly everyone stands up and

145
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,120
slaps a handcuff on their own self and locks themselves to the gate? Why would you do that?

146
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,260
It's like you're waiting there to get on the bus and here comes the bus, you handcuff your own

147
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,420
damn self to the bench. Oh my gosh. Can you imagine? That's a crazy visual. But this is

148
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,580
when I hear people respond to things that I say, it's exactly what it looks like in my mind.

149
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,160
I show things to people and tell them there's no way I could, like, wait a second, you don't

150
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,380
have enough time to think about it. And you're saying no way. You know, you're doing this.

151
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,960
I like this, what Brashear calls dungeon programming. They've all been corralled

152
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,520
into this dungeon automatically. So they've already, yeah, imagine, imagine just slapping

153
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,820
a handcuff or a neck cuff or a ball and chain on yourself every time you're ready to take a run.

154
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,280
Wait a second, I'm ready to run. OK, I got to put this ball and chain on first. Oh my gosh.

155
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,980
Well, isn't that the same as the whole thing with the math you talk about where, you know,

156
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,340
somebody says, oh, I'm just not good at math. I mean, yeah, but then it gets worse than that

157
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,780
because not being good at math means you're not good at what you're ready. Logic and reason.

158
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,440
Oh, my gosh. And you know what? The people that say that they're not good at math,

159
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,600
if you spend enough time with them, you'll find, guess what? They're not good at

160
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,680
logic and reason either, probably at all. Yeah. So. True enough, true enough. But,

161
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,820
you know, when you try and fit into it, stuff like the email work, right?

162
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,460
This also has to do with the yin and yang concept, but it's a little different, right?

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,860
Yeah. Well, you get both. Yeah. If you think on something a long time and email something,

164
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,980
a very general feeling is very yin. If you hold it long enough, it needs to be by necessity

165
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,160
balanced out by something yang. And suddenly you'll notice something like a lightning bolt

166
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,700
hit you, an idea or an effect or something. That's the yang part coming and vice versa.

167
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,500
Vice versa, if you have a very short burst of emotion.

168
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,580
Uh, internal or external, vocal or whatever, very short, but very powerful. Once it's over,

169
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
you become very yin, very like, oh, I'm out of energy. Here is someone go through a real angry

170
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,480
fit for two minutes and then after that, they're just ready to go to sleep. They're the calmest

171
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,220
people in the world. Oh, yeah. They become totally yin. Yeah. Again, by necessity, yin and yang

172
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,660
always works. So the emo does that too. So if you know how to control that, because it is a function

173
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,640
that we know through Greek speak, what the purpose of emotion is clearly definable instead

174
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,940
of this thing again for, what did I say earlier? Hallmark cards, right? Right, right. Uh, you can

175
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,380
actually use it now. The thing is, you know, how well are you, how good are you? Depends on how much

176
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,320
you practice and how well you practice and training is. So if you have like lousy training

177
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,800
for five years, that's no match for good training for, let's say five days, right? Right. So if

178
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,940
people say I have 20 years experience, I'm always when they're using the long time experience

179
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,740
because they're good. I always shy away from that because it's possible to actually have one year

180
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,120
of experience. 20 times means you stop learning after the first year and you've just been doing

181
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,980
the same shit for 20 years. That's all I see, by the way. That's generally the case. Yeah. They

182
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,480
learn everything pretty much. Yeah. Because, you know, put it this way. If you've got more than

183
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,080
three to five years experience in any field, you are easily, easily with no effort now,

184
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,080
world class at the top of the field in the world and any subject. So you got all these jerk offs

185
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,940
running around. I've got 20, 30 years experience. Yeah, I know what you got. You got anywhere

186
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,320
between three months to one year, 20 times or 30 times, you know, because I know for sure,

187
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,080
without a doubt that if you are compounding that experience for at least three to five years,

188
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,320
you are world class, the top of your field, any field. Right, for sure. That's not a doubt.

189
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,840
But what is the collective? No, it's 30 years experience. Oh, my gosh. No, it doesn't work

190
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,380
that way. Remember, this is planet Earth, guys. It's not it doesn't. Yeah, it's pathetic.

191
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,760
But the thing is, OK, what is the plus side of being on planet Earth? You have a short life,

192
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,000
a short life. This is the way the spans work here on Earth. You need at least 50 to 100 years to

193
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,180
master something on a master level where you can go beyond all of the physical things. It's

194
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,520
the difference between 30, three to five years and being a world class, world class among the

195
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,780
moronic society that you live in. Right. But to be a master, like a cosmic level master on, let's

196
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,180
say, furniture building, you're going to have to do it for 50 to 100 years. You don't have that

197
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,860
kind of time. You don't have time to become an adolescent, do 50 or 100 years of work to become

198
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,820
a master and then continue as a purveyor of that trade. It doesn't work. So you can't really

199
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,560
master things up to a universal cosmic level here. That's your first sign. The second sign

200
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,320
is look how people have allowed themselves to be drawn into these all these false

201
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,020
paradigms. Like, for example, I talked about academics talking about getting dead weight,

202
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,080
getting rid of dead weight like doctor. And by the way, if you're an academic and I spend time

203
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,640
with you, that's solely for entertainment purposes. I get I'm just having fun with you.

204
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,760
Like I'll play with a neighbor's dog. You know, nothing, whether you're a doctor, physicist,

205
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,720
engineer, whatever, whatever. I'm just having fun with you, dude. I'm sorry. I'm not messing

206
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,260
with you because I tell you this from the beginning. You don't really know any. You've

207
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,500
got find yourself. You got caught in the trap. And there's no song. We're caught in a trap. Right.

208
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,720
Can't get out, whatever. And now you are part of the welfare state. In other words,

209
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:34,220
you are reliant on the state to keep everyone in mind that you are important and you have some

210
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,820
social rank and you can go work in a company and make a good salary and buy a nice house,

211
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,980
have a good pension and all that. But that's part of the welfare state system.

212
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,540
And when you say welfare, say you think usually poor people living in public housing, right?

213
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,440
Leaking along. Right. Now, the welfare state, most of the welfare state is academia.

214
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Actually, it is academia and corporate corporate cutouts and all that stuff.

215
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,340
People make these corporations, they think, oh, my gosh, you know, nothing. That's part of the

216
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,400
World Economic Forum and the monetary fund. They know nothing, nothing. And if I'm talking to you

217
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,960
and you're one of these corporate cutout types, I'm also having fun with our entertainment purposes.

218
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,160
I never hear. I have never gotten anything useful out of you, the corporate types or the academic

219
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,140
types in my entire life at all. They just drag you along. And oh, my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. So I just

220
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,160
have to put that out because, look, I put this out right away when I talked to you. You're an

221
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,180
academic, dude. You know, you're an academic. You know that. Right. You know, and I guess to

222
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,220
reiterate, I walked into the pizza parlor the other day. I said, hey, everybody, you know,

223
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,500
what's this guy crazy or what? Hey, listen, I got money. I got money for somebody who can

224
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,800
answer this real fast and real soon. Can you think of anything that you use

225
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,100
commonly or uncommonly or that has helped advance society that was created or invented by an

226
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,460
academic or university? Everybody's like half people like this guy's crazy to look down at

227
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,760
their plate, you know, that people are like, you know, he's right. So let me give you an example.

228
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,720
How about the electric motor? No. How about the airplane? No. Right. How about the light bulb?

229
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,820
No. And they're like, yeah, I can't think of anything. What are they good for? I said,

230
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,780
they're good there to insult you. They're part of the welfare state. What they do is in order

231
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,300
for you to go into the into their world, they ask you how much of a college degree do you have?

232
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,160
Are you kidding? Are you kidding? You're asking me if I took part in that useless

233
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,080
form of education. It's not education. It is absolutely useless. But give another example.

234
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,740
This is a conversation. This covid thing, not only was it for to execute millions of people

235
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,160
by asphyxiating them on ventilators, by the way, if you and all these there are millions of

236
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,380
doctors involved in this and they're just being thanked by the people's families who they killed,

237
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,380
by the way. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. You would have the biggest Nuremberg thing where you would

238
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,660
take like you have to close half of I-95 for a few hundred miles and put enough rope to hang all

239
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,280
these bastards. Right. All these hospital administrators and doctors. OK. Anyway,

240
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,700
the only other stuff that they wanted to do with this covid thing was to flush out any good doctors

241
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:27,220
that were left in the system, because if there were any good doctors left in the system, they

242
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,680
spoke out. And guess what happened to them? They got booted. Right. So what covid-19 did is it?

243
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,520
Yes, guys, it flushed out anything, anyone that was left. So guess what you're left with now?

244
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:46,320
Uh-huh. Yeah. Avoid the hospitals, avoid the medical clinics if you can, if you can. Yes.

245
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,220
We start stocking up on what you think you might need and start applying it. Right. This is where

246
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,680
you're at. Yeah, I'm sorry. And it's going to get worse. The next one is going to be even worse.

247
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,080
And the one after, by the way, when the real pandemic comes by the end of this decade,

248
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,840
it will be completely denied. People will be getting up to go to work and not and not making

249
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,520
it through lunch. And it will be denied. We don't know why they're dying and it will be contagious

250
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:19,060
and it will never be in the media at all. The real one, when it you write, you see, I haven't

251
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,100
gotten into this. Real terrorism is never on TV. Right. It's a drill. You know, I was like, why

252
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,620
are these Blackhawk helicopters all over L.A.? We're not getting any response. Eight hours later,

253
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,460
our Pentagon says it was a drill. Yeah, sure. Well, we know rush hour. You got Apache helicopters

254
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,700
flying at, you know, traffic light level buzzing around. That's a drill. Sure. It is. Sure.

255
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Well, like right now, I was reading a news story that there is the largest NATO drill since 1988

256
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,860
going on now. And I said to myself, I wouldn't trust it. It's the opposite. But then again,

257
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,040
look at what they're doing with 9-11 was a drill. Right. Well, that's what that's what I'm saying.

258
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,460
That's what it was. Yeah. So, you know, but NATO is the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization.

259
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,960
That's that is how I would. Yeah, exactly. That's how you call it. I don't know. They're

260
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,860
calling it something else. Treaty Organization. I've seen nothing of the sort. It's the national.

261
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,320
Yeah, it's a terrorist organization. It's all backwards. I mean, this is no you have to make

262
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,720
fun of it. This is not this is not what I'm telling you is 100 percent accurate. It's it's

263
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,440
not a parody. It's like, wake the fuck up, you know, or actually don't. It's better to sleep

264
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,720
through this mess. Right. Yeah. That's yeah. That is actually the unfortunate thing is that I

265
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,480
sometimes say to myself, you know, I've got just enough awareness of this crap to know that this

266
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,260
is going to suck, you know, like kind of sucking, sucking for vacuum cleaners and girlfriends is

267
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:57,460
fine. So it's not always bad. But here's the aspect of it is this. You can still have a lot

268
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,880
of fun with it because you belong to the earth. Your mind doesn't. Right. The the principles that

269
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,720
you can understand don't actually for the regular people. Yes. Everything. Right. And people say

270
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,980
no way right away without thinking about it. And those people don't count. They're like the props,

271
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,860
the fill ins, whatever. They don't count. And that's most people, by the way. So what's going

272
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,200
on is you can still have, quote unquote, fun with it. Right. Just don't put your hand in the fire

273
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,480
and get into a lot of pain or whatever. But, you know, everyone's number does come up, you know,

274
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,240
to be pulled from here. So there's nothing really bad to look to look at it as being bad.

275
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,580
Is it good? Here we go again. Is it good? No. Yeah. No, it's not good. But is it bad? Not

276
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,100
bad either. Right. So it just walk in the middle. Yeah, it just is what it is. And it's and again,

277
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,080
like you said, the you know, the good news is it's a short time. So and by the way, just to recap,

278
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,640
you know, I know plenty of quote unquote academics, academics, I mean, medical doctors,

279
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,080
sir, surgeons, right. Physicists, engineers. There's a lot of quote unquote academics that

280
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,120
are here is a military, military people, a colonel, stuff like that. Right. And I just want

281
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,480
to recap. I do mention that they don't know. When I start half the time when we converse,

282
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,340
what I inject in there is what how they don't know what they're supposed to know and what they do

283
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,020
know is not true. And they always agree every time. Right. And when they try to defend it,

284
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,820
they go through this kind of like, fading when they try to defend something, they fade away.

285
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,300
It's like they imagine someone speaking in this voice gets really low. Like they can't project

286
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,440
at all. Right. You could tell like, Oh, you ran out of batteries there, dude. You know,

287
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,140
your robot with the program, you know, you ran out of tape or something. Yeah. And it's not to make

288
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,440
fun of them. It's strictly for me to have and have fun on my own as entertainment. Because again,

289
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,840
they are part of the welfare state. They're done. They're finished. They had plenty of

290
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,880
they can see they made the decision on eighth grade to continue for whatever reason. I know

291
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,920
you made your bed. Got to lie in it. Right. Okay. It doesn't mean they're going to have a bad life.

292
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,200
They could probably never fat pension tenure. Right. All that other stuff. Whatever. Yeah.

293
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,400
All those little societal perks or whatever. Yeah. And it makes it come. But internally,

294
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,660
they're miserable and ignorant internally, every one of them.
