1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,580
Rated Y, Sonic Event, 83.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,560
I had to think about that for a second because I was looking at the reverse number, I was

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
looking at what we did on 38 and that was interesting.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,300
Anyways, Greek, how are you doing tonight?

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,920
Doing all right, yeah, it sounds like we both got up from a nap, which we did.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,600
I did, you know, I didn't ask if you got up from a nap, I actually needed one real quick and yeah,

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,700
you can tell when I wake up from a nap, I'm like, hello, how are you?

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,320
It's the CO2 or whatever, yeah, the heaviness.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,560
Well, we've talked a lot about yin and yang, so think about it, you know,

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,700
the balance when you're one way, you express the antagonistic side, right?

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,780
Well, there's no effort being extended during your sleep time, you're kind of,

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,620
your body's relaxing, so when you do stand back up, you're kind of stiff or you're kind of young,

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,960
right, because you're sort of, you've been recharged a little bit, yeah?

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,580
Yeah, well, the deeper voice, right, is a longer frequency, longer sound waves are more young than

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,020
shorter sound waves, that's the direct approach and it works every time, but what happens is the

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,220
behavior of lower frequencies are more yin, they spread out, they're more omnidirectional,

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,980
the behavior of the yin short frequencies are more directional, actually, no, I'm sorry,

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,940
yeah, they are more directional, so you know, higher frequencies, you know, you make beams,

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,700
lower frequencies spread out like dropping a stone in a pond, then it flips again, right?

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,680
So, yeah, the antagonism, but I just want to quickly bring up, there's some activity in the

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,320
chat, a lot of it's redundant, but important, meaning going over something, even not,

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,900
well, let's just say, how many times is irrelevant if there's room for improvement,

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,360
right? So, that would be at the Chatango, I guess, Rated Y or Greek Speak Chatango,

24
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm not in front of it right now, what's it, anyone can go there and post, there's been

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,960
some activity about the Aqua Sargentum stuff recently and I believe that it's quite important.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,320
Right, it's actually, it's actually ocelliandthegreek.chatango.com,

27
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,180
that's where you can go directly to it, yeah.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,740
Okay, good, all right, good, I'll commit that to memory then, okay,

29
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,420
yeah, redundant stuff that's been gone over, but apparently needs to be gone over again,

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,040
so, yeah, what do you want to mention? Well, let me ask you this, what about confirmation?

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Because confirmation seems to be an important thing, right? Even though you've had a thought,

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,860
you've studied something, you've been over it, you've observed it, a lot of times you seek

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,740
confirmation, you know, in scientific terms, a lot of times, okay, I hate to use it,

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,640
I know it's a dirty word, but scientific terms, what do they do? Can you replicate the experiment?

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,460
Can you confirm that this is what happens when this happens, right? Because...

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,620
Yeah, well, the confirmation is still a perception and it has, all perceptions have biases built in

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,020
and they're all subjective, but when you say scientific, yeah, it really is a bad word,

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:16,240
it has been for a long, long time, until people stop accepting it and let it just die out in the

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,740
form that it's in, and then let it be reborn in the proper form that it should be, in any proper

40
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,560
form of anything, whether it's the legal cult, the medical cult, the scientific cult, all they

41
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,040
have to do is follow what they're supposed to be doing, and no one's following or doing what

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,400
they're supposed to be doing, and in other words, what do you mean, Greek, what are they supposed

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,360
to be doing? Well, if they memorialize it, they have a set of codes and rules and things and ethics

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,780
or procedures, and they've memorialized it, meaning written down, whether it's black ink on white paper

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,500
or even digital format, if it's something someone can access, if you go contrary to that and go far

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,900
away from that to the point where you no longer resemble what you're supposed to be doing from

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,800
that point of view, you need to be done away with, and the way to do away with them, by the way,

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,260
whenever you hear of like revolution, overthrow, civil war, that's all this, that's all rooted in

49
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,680
secret societies, by the way, the order out of chaos meme, right? Right. Real rational people

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,300
don't do that, right? What I mean by real rational people don't get involved in civil wars or

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,560
revolutions or overthrows, why? Give me an example. So you really, well, you're having lunch with

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,320
people and you walk into a diner cafe, and you really don't like tuna fish sandwiches or tuna

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,280
fish on the menu, they've got other things, and you really don't like ham and cheese. The moment

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
you see those things that you don't like on the menu, do you gather up a whole bunch of people,

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,020
go back and let's grab all that stuff and throw it in the dumpster and beat the chef up for

56
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:53,420
putting it on the menu? No, what do you do? You just don't order it, right? So whenever you hear

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,940
about all that stuff, it's just people are suckers, you know, and they fall for all that stuff. So,

58
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,640
okay, so hearken back real quick, is the American Revolution a fraud? 100%. Name another country,

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,820
by the way, and if you don't know this, you can look it up. Name another country that teaches

60
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,520
that the Americans had a revolution against the British in their history classes, whether it's,

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
you know, grade school, elementary or college. You can't, you can't, this is the only country

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,720
that does it. It's totally it was a total hoax, just like everything else, right? So, you know,

63
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,520
they'll mention other things, but never the revolutionary, because all these things that

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,900
people get caught up in are pre-directed, prescribed, even Roosevelt said anything

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,360
that happens has been pre-planned, right? So, you know, you can keep going down the line and

66
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,660
see this stuff. So until the mental attitude is checked by the individual, right, each individual

67
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,680
and the process that they use, which is important, and it's negated, and the process that they use

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,740
is usually a proper process, something that's very rational, and benefits everyone is inaction.

69
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:11,660
Not doing anything is the best thing one can do. You know, it's not dropping out, because let's

70
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,780
say you want to get rid of the scientific system or just academia in general, right,

71
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:25,200
which has no purpose anymore. You don't go to sign up for college ever or and reject their

72
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,140
things, make fun of them. Now, okay, you notice the part that was don't go to college, don't sign up,

73
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,000
that's the inaction. But to make fun of it, you have to put action and energy into that.

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,860
And it's not about dropping out of the system or that subject, you actually have to invest a lot

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:50,060
of time in promoting the necessity of avoiding it and, you know, not using that system. So

76
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:58,660
when I say not using a system, and so it goes away, you starve it, right? By popularity,

77
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,300
it takes a lot of work to do that you have to actually create, you know, helps propaganda,

78
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,440
what they call propaganda, you know, propaganda just means advertising and awareness of why you

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,340
should not use that and avoid it, right? So it's not when I say inaction, on one side inaction

80
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,320
directly relative to the thing, because you're no longer feeding it, but it takes a lot of action

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,780
on the other side to show other people why they should not participate.

82
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,360
I'll give you a fun example to work with that, you know, I know you've heard of over the years,

83
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,480
I don't think they do this anymore. But it used to be every couple of years, there would be some

84
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,780
sort of rumor that would circulate that no one is going to buy gas on a particular day.

85
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah, right. That's very effective, by the way. And no one does it.

86
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,060
Well, here's the thing, everybody starts talking about it. And they would go to and I used to work

87
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,580
at gas stations, as I've told you many times, and I worked at Exxon Mobil specifically, mostly,

88
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,060
but I worked at other gas stations. And people would come in and tell me, you know what,

89
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,840
tomorrow, you're gonna be bored, you know, a couple of people would get into it to the point

90
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,880
where they thought no one was going to show up and buy gas, because that was going to be their

91
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,800
big protest against what they thought was a high gas price, which, by the way, was hilarious,

92
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,020
because we're talking about around $1 on a gallon of gas in the time period, I'm talking about where

93
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,500
this happened several times. And it was $1, including the taxes, the state taxes, which

94
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,419
anywhere, you know, I get it. But you know what, it doesn't matter. It's the relative, you know,

95
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:36,000
like right now, the dollar is about point seven, eight cents. Yeah, people when people say 70. No,

96
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,900
no, that's it. It's three quarters of a penny is the buying power right now, right? Yeah, it's

97
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,380
and it's all relative. But you actually actually things are cheaper right now, because you use

98
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,920
lawful money, like a silver piece is $1. And a silver piece is around $25. You know, dollars

99
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,780
right now to buy, right. So that means that if gasoline was $1, when silver was $1, that means a

100
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,860
gallon of gasoline should be $25. And it's not it's where I'm at, it's $3 or less, California

101
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,900
at $6 or more. So it's still pretty cheap. Actually, a minimum wage. Well, in law and biblical, it's a

102
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,480
silver dollar per day as a minimum wage. But now even if you're on minimum wage, you could buy at

103
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,960
least two and a half after, you know, if you're not in redeeming lawful money, two and a half of

104
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,440
those. So things are way cheaper. And an easy way to I postulate that is by watching the price

105
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,300
that price is right from the 1970s, which is a factor of 12 to one right now. Right. So when

106
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,260
you look at like a thing of wishbone salad dressing, that was 79 cents in 1972. And today's

107
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,100
money that you know, 12 ounce wishbone salad dressing would be over $13. And it's not no,

108
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,660
it's like it's not three bucks. Yeah, two, three bucks. So yeah, so things are much cheaper. It's

109
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,640
relative from that point of view. But because it's an elastic currency, you know,

110
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,520
the situation is taken advantage. And also, I've done a bunch of research on this and had

111
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,080
quote, unquote, confirmation. And a lot of these border state cities regarding gas stations,

112
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm talking about the gas stations that take up a good amount of acreage and have all the bright

113
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,300
lights and they look polished, and they're well maintained, right? They're owned by ex cops and

114
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,860
ex military, their money laundering operations, because I think I've gone over this before,

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,880
if you're a cop long enough, or in the military long enough, you're going to find that your

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,480
superiors are putting while you're in your career, I'm asking you to do some strange things. And

117
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,940
after a while, you find out like, hey, shouldn't we be arresting these guys, instead of protecting

118
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,060
them. And you find out that the police and the military actually controlled by the cartels,

119
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,020
right. So when you get out of the business, you still have all those content contacts,

120
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,440
you have a little black book, maybe not the top guys, but all the guys, you know, the runners and

121
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,120
whatever the captains, the guys doing all the, you know, boots on the ground, and you still have a

122
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,100
long list of all these guys, and you're like, they need to turn cash. So average gas station

123
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,440
can make several million dollars a month gross on a bank account running through the bank,

124
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,840
they make a tiny amount of profit barely to keep the lights on. So what they do is they ask their

125
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,740
friends, hey, we know we run several million dollars a cashier a month, you give me a half a

126
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,940
million a week or whatever, I could run it through and it won't flag anything. If some people don't

127
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,880
understand, like if you have like $5,000 in your bank account, and you have a friend who is a drug

128
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,540
runner, and he gives you $200,000 in cash to put in your bank account, that's going to flag you big

129
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,520
time because they have averages really say, this guy's usually between five and 10 grand suddenly

130
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,020
jumps up to a quarter of a million, let's check them out, right, get in trouble. So the IRS is

131
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,940
the largest money laundering, the taxing franchises are the largest money laundering,

132
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,460
like right before war, billions per day get run through the IRS. And no one, you know, any

133
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,760
international monitor, if I look at it, say, well, it's the IRS, of course, billions,

134
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,500
right, and they just redistribute it. And this is how the world works, by the way, and most people

135
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,140
kind of sit back. And again, they don't think there's anything they can do about it. There's a

136
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,580
lot they could do. Right. And for you to have massive cash in an account with a gas station is

137
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,020
not a big deal at this point. Because every truck that shows up is like a $25,000 payment that needs

138
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,480
to be made upon receipt. So before you sell it, so literally what they what you need to have

139
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,180
actually is a couple of those deliveries in the bank at a bare minimum to take Oh, yeah. Now

140
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,600
you attach Yeah, they move a lot. In other words, their activity is so high. It's not that they're

141
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,140
making profits or what they call just the general activity, you know, like the two brothers selling

142
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,320
watermelon out of the truck joke, maybe I should rehash that one. But But yeah, it's just the

143
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,100
activity so high that you don't get flagged if he goes up, you know, shipping companies, you know,

144
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,940
telephone bills, if you ever want to run a telephone scam, run it through a big corporation

145
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,300
that's got 100 $200,000 a month phone bill, they'll never see a $1200 phone call, right?

146
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,080
It's hidden in there, right? That's how the system works on their end, you know, and yeah,

147
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,780
and by the way, you know, the these cops and military that run these gas stations retired or

148
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,040
whatever, they still enjoy the benefits of their contacts in the police force and the military

149
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,920
also, by the way, right. So they're a formidable group. And actually, I should know shouldn't really

150
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,160
disclose exactly how I know this exactly, exactly, because it'll be too obvious. But it's for sure.

151
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,020
I've seen it. So I happen to know you're right.

152
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,380
Yeah, it's and I mean, I was like, wait a second. Okay, this is too obvious, right?

153
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,760
Yeah. Notice, I didn't say I think you're right. Or that sounds right. I said, I know you're right.

154
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,820
Um, yeah, so this is a dirt. Now. Is it dirty? I don't know. You know, it's up to you to decide.

155
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,560
Is it because after all, look, you set up a business and you basically regulate it so that

156
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,100
you're supposed to make you know, what, what is the best gas station make 10 or 12 cents on a gallon

157
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,260
of gasoline at best that can't keep the lights in the maintenance, you know,

158
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm talking about the nicer gasoline stations, right? Well, right. When you see a place that

159
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,320
has all those lights on you not much that costs to keep that lit when you pay that bill straight

160
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,040
to the power company, you got to be kidding me. Once you take that 1213 cents a gallon, you say,

161
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,280
oh, you're making a good profit. How? Because think about the electrical cost per day when

162
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,680
you break that, forget it. It's gone. There's no way to make those work. I mean, yeah, the work

163
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,480
they'll be self sustained. But again, there's still not making a tremendous amount of money.

164
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,200
It's actually the ex cops and ex military set these by these gas stations and run them as a

165
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,720
service to their, to their contacts, really, they're even the guys, you know, and also they

166
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,860
do make a pretty good bank from they get a cut, right? The growing rates anywhere between one or

167
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,960
2% 5% sometimes. Yeah, but they're not going to get it. It's a service is the way things are done.

168
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,580
I mean, you know, by the way, the real money with the high profit, like for example, this is the

169
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:18,300
going rate for intelligence agencies option in black market is 1000%. So whenever you see things

170
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,940
that are 1000 2000 5000% profit, it's an intelligence agency up like Bitcoin, all the all the

171
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:35,540
the major cryptocurrencies are 1000% intelligence agency operation. And people fall for it. They

172
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,900
think they're bucking the system, right by getting it, but they're going into the dirtiest aspect

173
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,840
and supporting the dirtiest aspect of like, for instance, years ago, I used to ask all the time

174
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,200
an open question. Nobody quite understood why I was asking it. But how does the search engine

175
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,960
make a billion dollars? You see, it doesn't. Okay, well, no, he I think there's a zero point

176
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,800
that happened about five years ago, where right now you should if you have an internet hookup,

177
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,840
or a smartphone, you should be getting paid to use it. Because they're actually making more

178
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,480
money by selling your activity. It's, you know, 10ths of a penny, every time you do something

179
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,640
right now. So I think it's been three years or five years or something that they crossed a zero

180
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,720
point. It was it was a very small article was written in a financial paper, but it was written

181
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,240
in a way that you really had to know this was going on for it to matter. If you didn't know

182
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,280
this was going on, and you read that you wouldn't know what they were talking about. For right now,

183
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,520
if you in other words, because there is what brought this up is in the door, there's a new

184
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,200
fiber optic companies, 50 bucks a month, you get 500 megabytes. I'm like, Are you joking? I pick

185
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,800
you have to pay me, because you're monetizing every so everyone right now anyone if you have

186
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,160
any kind of internet subscription or smartphone or whatever, a few years ago got to the point where

187
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,940
they are making more money off of you, right, then it costs to provide you the surface now.

188
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
Right, right. So in other words, anyone who has a smartphone or internet hookup should be getting

189
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,460
a check every month, a tiny amount or a small amount, all the albeit, you know, percentage.

190
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,160
And no, is that happening? No, they're asking you to keep paying for it, because you're used to it,

191
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,680
right. So that's how the scientific system works. Also, it's just like people that continue to

192
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,339
complain that, you know, they put people in prison, and then my tax dollars pay for that. Whoa,

193
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,880
hang on. What is what? Yeah, that's the programming. See, the aspect of programming is you get people

194
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,620
into the programming. So when people say when you say people are programmed, right, or brainwashed,

195
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,700
they think it's because Oh, yeah, you just give them false information. They believe No,

196
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,260
it has nothing to do with the information, you create a stance in the mind. In other words,

197
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:48,280
the mind thinks first, and then you give it the false information because any rational human,

198
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,780
if you give him basic information that's false, enough times with enough of these humans,

199
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,320
even though they're not smart, they'll figure it out pretty quickly. But if you instill a

200
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,820
programming and operating system in first, like, you know, you have to be patriotic,

201
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,780
the authorities arrive without telling them anything first about taxpayer dollars or any or

202
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,780
whatever, whatever history that or how their body works, they'll believe anything. So you have to

203
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,960
give them the setup first, right? Right. And that's, that's what people no one talks about,

204
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,880
they'll bring up a bit of bad information, and say, that's part of brainwashing. No, it's not.

205
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,980
The brainwashing has to happen before any information is disseminated. Otherwise, it'll

206
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,200
be rejected. Well, and that's the thing is that look, and I started with that stance, and you

207
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,440
stopped me a tax dollars, but we can keep going. The idea that it caught will cost money to house

208
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,480
people in it. Well, yeah, okay. But here's that. Well, here's the thing. In short, they fund it

209
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,160
themselves if they right. Okay. In other words, when you go to places, and they say, Oh, do you

210
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,600
want to donate the change to this charity? I'm like, why are their hands broken? And they're

211
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,680
like, what, excuse me? I said, the other hands broken mean there's no money. And it's all

212
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,540
generated from the signature. Why don't these charities just go to the Federal Reserve window?

213
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,960
Have everyone in there sign a piece, you know, sign a document with how much they need in the

214
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,300
Federal Reserve should honor that. Oh, I mean, that's how the money system works. You don't need

215
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,520
the very fact that charities exist is a fraud. Because the money is generated from their

216
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,900
signature. I mean, isn't all right, let's say it's an orphanage with children. Isn't there anyone?

217
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,020
Is there a principal at the off or someone at the orphanage? Anyone? Executive power there that is

218
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,120
older than 18? Of course, there is someone Why don't they just sign whatever, you know,

219
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,160
a bill, whatever, and go to the Fed window and get the money you need to run the charity? Why are you

220
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,920
asking me for? What do I look like a bank? Right? So that's how the money system works. And they

221
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,180
keep going whenever, by the way, whenever you hear of charities, do not give do not donate to any

222
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:55,020
charity ever. By the way, you know, the scam on that too, right? So I used to do that. But you

223
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,060
know, I, there's a lot of things I used to do before I understood. But even still, you know,

224
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,900
these people that are in even at the mid level of the system, they're monetized, it pays for itself,

225
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,740
it's for profit. You're telling well, it's not it's about control. There's no payment.

226
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,280
There's settling in that we might have to get into how this works. Because the language

227
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,940
the way it's just like the aqueous Argentum and the scalarator and the talks that I do on certain

228
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,500
technologies. Okay. You know, I'll talk about it. And I'll watch what people do. And then I have to

229
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,360
back and talk about it from, you know, point one, again, maybe a little more detail, right?

230
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:38,320
Start all over from the beginning again, you know, on many things, by the way, yeah, we did a

231
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,420
there's a Skype group with the about the scalerator, basically, I call it mark one.

232
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,860
And I just want to, I'm going to be doing one again very soon, probably tomorrow or tonight,

233
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,240
and record it. But I'll throw in some cool stuff there. And the reason why I'm saying cool stuff,

234
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:04,420
is because since this came into development around April of 2023. As the moons go by the

235
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,280
moons literally every month or so there is a new development or a revelation on what this

236
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,240
thing is doing and what can be done more to make it more effective. And each improvement,

237
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,180
each change modification that moves it forward and making it more effective

238
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,340
comes on a monthly basis. I've noticed this by just looking at my notes. So every month,

239
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,180
there is another improvement or some revelation regarding what's going on that comes about.

240
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,320
So is that a slow process where you get one new thing about it every month? I think it's pretty

241
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,880
slow. It's but then again, whoever sits down and bring something new into this reality,

242
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,580
and you get it all at once, right? Never, you know, if you look at how let's say automobiles

243
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,920
were developed from the mid 1800s till now, I mean, they didn't pop, you know, modern looking

244
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,920
car right away, did they? Right? No, not at all. You started out there. They started out with

245
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,920
bicycle tires, from my understanding. And then yeah, you know, slow development. Yeah. So but

246
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,400
I've been getting these improvements every on a monthly basis has been over, you know, it's been

247
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,400
910 of them right now. So and one, okay, why am I saying this? Because one just came up a few hours

248
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:22,720
ago. I knew it's hot, not still still hot. And we'll talk about it. And it makes sense anyway,

249
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,800
because look, if you need to take it and then actually do it, and then observe the result,

250
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,120
then turn around and disseminate it. I mean, realistically, that's about a month's worth of

251
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,540
time. Yep. Well, yeah, and it's developing to the point and it's so radical, the scalarator must say

252
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,300
so that eventually, well, if we had enough time, and you went into the future, there'd be this

253
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,580
would be a new thing that would be taught at university. It would be a look, there's a new

254
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,800
thing here. It should be taught, but it won't be, you know, when computers and all that were

255
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,740
up, you know, like becoming a desirable item, by the way, in the late 70s, people don't know this,

256
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,680
but the PC movement started in the late 70s, right? Early 80s. Yeah, there was no college

257
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:13,480
courses on computers about PCs. No, not at all. Not at all. Matter of fact, to go to popular

258
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,140
culture, when you saw that kid screwing around with the, you know, computer on in the movie

259
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,700
war games, that was literally the front, you know, the vanguard, if you will, of the PC movement,

260
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,960
because it was people getting these things and working with them on their own and sorting it out.

261
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,140
What to do? No college courses, university, nothing like that. Well, let's use the phone

262
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,660
lines, because that's an existing transmission that we can use. And therefore, we can transfer

263
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,580
data that way. We know we can already do that because of stuff like the telex and

264
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,080
what was effectively a fax machine. Yes, those existed long before we ever did.

265
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,980
Oh, yeah, those existed in the 1800s. By the way, they found out with the telegraph,

266
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,180
you could send images with the telegraph, right? It wasn't very popular. But yeah,

267
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,160
detailed images also, you know, yes, it took a very long time, but you could get done. Yeah,

268
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,280
I was gonna say it was a very long process. I mean, and then then later on, we had the printers that,

269
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:19,220
you know, you know, and that technology, by the way, the current technology is was around back

270
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,540
then also just wasn't available to the public, as per usual, just like the internet itself was

271
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,200
available in the 1970s. When you're talking about the vanguard of the PC movement, well,

272
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,060
that was the public PC movement, the military was already using these things and keyboards and all

273
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:38,420
that. You know, like when they showed you in 83, and they go to the massive, you know, war room

274
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,500
with the big screens and all that. Okay, that's not the way it really looks. But at some point,

275
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,720
it might have because they already had those keyboards. That's the antiquated technology

276
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,920
they were showing you in 83 that you thought was on the cutting edge, because we were just

277
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,540
getting these things at Radio Shack, you know, so therefore, it made sense to the public. Yep. And

278
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,840
well, yeah, that's, that's a funny term, because as we go through time right now,

279
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,360
less and less will make sense. So yeah, and exactly the opposite happens. I mean, at this

280
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,260
point in time, we can instantaneously communicate with individuals anywhere on planet Earth, right,

281
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,100
according to the technology that we're allowed to have. Right. And guess what, you notice people

282
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,620
are communicating less and less, even with the facilities to communicate more and more easily.

283
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,940
Lean and young. Yeah, yeah, their minds are becoming mushy and soft. And yeah,

284
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,300
the human animal is something I mean, it's not they're not animals, but the human creature,

285
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,540
right, you know, I still go around, by the way, oh, I just want to mention what I do

286
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:49,640
did this past week, what I've been doing for a while is there's meetups groups on the internet

287
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,880
for your local city, town, whatever, right, just type in meetup, wherever place you are,

288
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,420
and you'll see there's a website, it's like a social thing. And people post, you know,

289
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,840
like a book club or authors meeting or whatever, whatever subject in your neighborhood, right,

290
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,960
you sign in, sit up and show up. It's usually at a cafe or someplace, a lot of them are online.

291
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,840
Right. But I go to these, by the way, I've been going to them for a couple of months now. And,

292
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,380
and usually the ones for authors, author meetups and book grab meetups, people want to write books

293
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:28,000
and you know, all this other stuff. And because why? Well, because who writes books? Pretty much

294
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,920
anyone, right? Is it possible that doctors and psychiatrists, psychologists,

295
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:41,000
lawyers, engineers, military housewives, right, everybody can write a book. And I very often when

296
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,880
I start knocking these academics, by the way, it's not because I sit around and I imagine it,

297
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,200
it's because I don't know how to say it. Yeah, I actually go and meet them and listen to them talk

298
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,260
and speak. And because what you know, when you're in the in person, you can actually speak to them

299
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,720
in person. And I run the Greek speak by them not not the Greek speak that I do meaning the emanations

300
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,860
of the Greek speak. But I asked questions, like you would hear in Greek speak wanting to ask and

301
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:19,820
you should see them all flat every time every one of them. And they're just wonder what you know,

302
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,940
maybe this guy is not from here. Maybe he's really not from here like he said he was, you know. And

303
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,380
yes, I run into pretty much across the gamut. Because remember, they want to write a book,

304
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,820
they think they can communicate, they think they know something, right. And it's funny. It's funny

305
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,900
to I've been I've been observing this. And it's I'm actually happy. I'm grateful that that this

306
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,280
exists. Because, you know, very often, you'll hear me like, you know, talk about how dumb these people

307
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,440
are, you know, the academics are professionals, is because I probably just got back fresh from a

308
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,800
meeting from an author's club or something. I just wanted to throw that out there in case people were

309
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,440
curious. Look, and we all do some form of this, right? What do you do when you meet somebody and

310
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,040
you don't know much about them? And you can't really glean that much from looking at them.

311
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,000
They're kind of just, you know, general sort of generic looking. People often will ask questions,

312
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,800
right? They'll see what their interests are, they'll see what it is that catches their attention

313
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,680
in general, to see if there's some common ground commonality, maybe. So if you do this with

314
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,440
Greek speak stuff, you know,

315
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,200
in mind, yeah, like, like, you know, I say the engineers don't know anything about engineering,

316
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,500
the physicists don't know anything about physics, psychologists don't know anything about psychology,

317
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,700
on and on and on and on. I'm saying it from a firsthand point of view, meaning firsthand,

318
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,080
you know, experience with them show up with the doctor and you say, Doctor, what is your thought

319
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,320
on digesting food? You know, regarding this, this, what do you think about eating these kind of foods

320
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,100
and digesting them? Now, if they don't correct you and say, well, you know, all these things are

321
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,020
done by induction. You know, you've got somebody who is not on the side of understanding this,

322
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,860
this end of the pool. Yeah. But if he lets his peers know that he knows that he'll quickly find

323
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,000
himself sleeping on a park bench, right? Because now he'll be the crazy guy. Oh, he just doesn't

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,220
adhere to any of the stuff that we know is true in academia. Therefore, and I am polite, like,

325
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,080
you wouldn't believe how many engineers I met. They said, I'm an engineer retired from Raytheon.

326
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,060
I'm like, should I tell him like everyone at Raytheon, even the one in the gift shop is

327
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,720
an engineer? I shouldn't say that. That would make him feel kind of right. Because you go out

328
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,480
in the public and you say, I'm an engineer at Raytheon. Oh, wow. He's an engineer at Raytheon.

329
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,920
But the public doesn't know that the janitor is also an engineer. And so is the person working

330
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,400
behind the clerk at the cashier at the desk at the gift shop. I mean, there's no gift shop,

331
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,420
but you know what? It's not it doesn't mean anything. And the security guards are taking

332
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,220
night classes to become an engineer. Yeah. No, I mean, but, you know, when someone tells you I'm

333
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:58,140
an engineer or whatever, I'm like, yeah, the guard dog. I mean, it means absolutely nothing. But

334
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:04,620
outside. Right. And he knows they know that means nothing. They walk around in the public and they

335
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:12,180
say something like that. Oh, he's an engineer. Oh, boy. You know. Yeah, it happens all the way

336
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:18,340
around. You hear people say, oh, well, this guy, you know, he went to college for a lot. You know,

337
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,740
what's really funny is that some people don't even inquire about what the degree is. Right.

338
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:31,060
He's just got a college degree. Oh, yeah. It's it's the doctor who the psychic papers. I don't

339
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,400
know if anyone's familiar with Doctor Who. Whenever he goes about his annals and adventures,

340
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,680
he has a wallet, just a blank piece of paper. And whoever he shows it to it, they see like what is

341
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,680
the highest authority from their world. Right. Right. And they let him go. It's just a blank

342
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,740
piece of paper. It's called the psychic papers. You just show them psychic papers. Oh, yeah. Wow.

343
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,380
Look at that. I love the puns and jokes on society that are done in Doctor Who that way.

344
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,520
Oh, yeah. And I still appreciate I know you're not I don't think you're the biggest fan of Star

345
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,300
Trek, but I appreciate it. I was taking a look at something earlier today. Just listen.

346
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,420
No, but Star Trek, by the way, is real Marxism. You know, no one. By the way,

347
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,400
no one has ever done real Marxism. They just show you like the bad stuff, you know,

348
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,600
that could be interpreted poorly. The Marxist. Yeah. Even it's a good example of Mark, but still

349
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,040
not because in Marxism, once people organize a certain way to benefit themselves, the state is

350
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,500
eliminated. There is no top authority. So it is a form of anarchy. And oh, boy, does he say anarchy?

351
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Yeah. Anarchy just means you rule yourself. Castle doctrine. But anyway, Star Trek. Yes.

352
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,940
Just without without the leader. That's all that is. But anyway, no leadership required.

353
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,220
But what's funny about Star Trek is I was listening to something and what I caught in the midst of it

354
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,880
was, you know, are you naive enough to believe that there is a difference between physics

355
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:01,640
and biology? There is physics through biology and vice and vice versa and vice versa. Like they are

356
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,800
interconnected. It's not a separate. But see, if you talk to an academic,

357
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,640
they would tell you, well, there's either physics or biology. Right. Yeah. You shouldn't be talking.

358
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,620
Well, what they do is like you can have someone studying geology, but they don't know anything

359
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,300
about biology and vice versa. But the two intermix. You have some of these things called

360
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,340
fossils, right, which are biological forms that are now mineralized and become logical. Yeah.

361
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,120
Yeah. But they don't crisscross. They don't. Yeah. Yeah. This is a very simple ploy to show

362
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,440
that this is how you control people and stop doing. I wanted to do you know how that bumper

363
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
stickers. My child is an honor student at whatever. Oh, yeah. I want to do bumper sticker.

364
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,020
So if I had a child, the only time I would consider sending them to university is if I

365
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:54,300
knew they were a total idiot. Right. Anyway, I did see a bumper sticker sort of like that

366
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,480
one time that said something like, I send my child to your school because I hate them

367
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,060
or something like that. Oh, yeah, that's pretty much. I thought that was kind of funny. And I

368
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,320
thought of you, actually, that this was a couple of years ago. You just reminded me of it. The

369
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,280
bumper sticker. I said, my child do your school because I hate them. I just I don't know why

370
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,780
I thought it was funny. Anyway, a lot of a lot of comedy. And that's another thing, too, is,

371
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,460
I say we should laugh at a lot of things, especially when we see that they're so absurd.

372
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,660
And I always appreciated that form of theater, theater of the absurd. What are your thoughts

373
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,940
on that, though, like entertainment and how it educates people or mis-educates them or

374
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:44,720
de-educates them? Entertainment is it is. Well, just like the education system is there to take

375
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,400
your time. Yeah. But you like to be entertained sometimes yourself. I mean, you intentionally

376
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,980
waste your time and find value in it. No, actually, I don't think of it that way.

377
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,540
When I engage in what they call entertainment faculties, it's because I have a curiosity in

378
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:06,600
the subject also. Yeah. OK, so that makes sense. I was just curious about that because I'm saying

379
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,100
to myself, you know what? It's a form of emo also the way you feel. Right. Well, but that's the

380
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:21,639
thing, is that to me, if it if it allows you to expand to casually engage in certain emotions

381
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,920
and explore that, isn't that a purpose in and of itself? So, you know, people feel like laughter

382
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,040
is the best medicine. I do think that it is a positive thing to enjoy the comedy of something,

383
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,639
whether it's because it's ludicrous or whatever the point of it is. You know, you know how it's

384
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,400
like a lot of people say in that work in comedy, they'll tell you something like, I don't know how

385
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,239
to explain to you how something is funny. It just is or it isn't. It's one of those things where if

386
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,600
the experience works, it works. And laughing and enjoying something for its comedic aspects,

387
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,420
whether you're mocking the ridiculousness of this idea of authority and where it comes from and

388
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,100
exactly how poorly educated the authorities are, or if you're looking at somebody getting, you know,

389
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:13,420
smacked in the sack, it doesn't matter. It can all have a movement in your emotional core reaction

390
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:21,500
that I think also has some value. So even though a lot of times you, me, a lot of people might mock

391
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,460
what comes out of the entertainment business and you might not want to engage in a lot of it.

392
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,000
Entertainment has its place, you know? Oh, yeah. But but here's the important part is years ago,

393
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,820
I say, why would I go to college? I have a television because they they have to be in

394
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,720
accordance with each other. Right. They can't. Right. So, you know, whether it's smart fact or

395
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,280
fiction, usually fact and entertainment, you know, like History Channel, whatever,

396
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,180
they have to teach the same stuff in school. Right. So you don't need. Well, why are you going

397
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,140
to go to school and they're going to give you the same B.S. that you're getting on TV? You know, so

398
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,960
you do one or the other. You're just as educated, you know, even now and pretty much on any subject.

399
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,320
You have enough documentaries that feed you enough bullshit that if you study what they tell

400
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,920
you in documentaries and go to university, it's the same bullshit. So why? Right. The only thing

401
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,640
is you don't get a degree. How about a degree in watching television? You know, I think everyone

402
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,540
pretty much has that anyway. Look, and that's true. And there are degrees in that, oddly enough.

403
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,480
But back to it, even even your discussions about going to YouTube University, which,

404
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,060
again, 40 years ago, not something you could do. You did have to go somewhere to find out,

405
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,960
figure out, or you had to figure it out for yourself how to say, you know, install a pipe or

406
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,440
make something, you know, repair your lamp or whatever it was you were trying to do,

407
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,060
you know, put your drywall up properly, this and that. You had to go get a book, you know,

408
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,580
the Time Life Series, something you had to go do something. But nowadays, at the tips of your

409
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,800
fingers, a lot of things that used to be specialized knowledge are no longer specialized.

410
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,700
And it makes the the the idea of university, the idea of a lot of trade schools,

411
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,620
although I don't object to trade schools, it makes the idea of a lot of this training,

412
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,660
these certificates, this nonsense, completely irrelevant, because it's still relevant.

413
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,540
It hasn't there isn't a complete takeover of the media, you know, YouTube or

414
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,860
digital media. There's no complete takeover yet. I don't think it'll ever happen because

415
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,060
people intuitively know that it's temporary. It's going to go down, right? It's going to go away.

416
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,680
But it all seems like but if you were to maintain that, if that was carefully done,

417
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,940
it seems to me like indeed, anybody could be anything, you could be your own plumber,

418
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,620
you can be your own electrician, you can be your own mechanic all the time.

419
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,580
Sure, it's an advantage, because there are people that became their own whatever without

420
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,220
the digital help, right? The digital help makes it a lot faster. I mean,

421
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,640
give me an example, again, with the scalerator bending heavy schedule 80 PVC pipe,

422
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,820
I figure I need to heat it from the inside and the outside at the same time, how about pouring

423
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,880
hot sand in it, and experimenting, you know, what the right temperature is and plugging it and I'll

424
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,240
make it soft like taffy and also heat it from the outside. And I did that. And then I said,

425
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,640
I said, Wait a second, why don't I go on YouTube and research or the internet how to bend PVC pipe

426
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,420
and guess what they were doing? They're filling it with hot sand and bending it around. But you

427
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,700
know, so makes perfect sense. Because you know what, when you I don't know if you know this,

428
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,000
but you know, plastic glasses, right? You know, your glasses frames, that's exactly how they used

429
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,200
to bend them. Sure, sure, sure. But to me, it was intuitive. But at the same time, if I didn't have

430
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,360
that intuition, and I just went ahead and went and straight to the stupid rectangle and, you know,

431
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,680
searched it, I would have found it right away. So what I'm saying is, someone who's intuitive,

432
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,940
and someone who isn't intuitive are more on equal footing now because of YouTube University.

433
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,780
Yeah, well, but that's, but that's my point is now it makes it even more relevant that I went

434
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,760
to school to learn how to bend pipe, you know? Right? Yeah. Well, by the way, I just want to

435
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,460
footnote here, I've told people go to YouTube University, and they've gotten back and I couldn't

436
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,040
find it. I'm like, What do you mean you couldn't find, you know, changing the water pump on your

437
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,020
whatever, like, No, I couldn't find this thing called YouTube University. Oh, no, no, no,

438
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,820
I just call it that. I just call it that, you know, so I just want to footnote, there's no such thing

439
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,520
that I know of is just go to YouTube and search what you want to do. And someone's probably

440
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,980
done a video where you can at least see it is almost as good as firsthand knowledge.

441
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,300
Yeah, there's almost always a how to whether it's, you know, trying to whatever the warning

442
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,440
thing is on your computer, or it's to, you know, restart your phone properly. If you press these

443
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,340
buttons in this order, or if it's to again, put in, you know, the starter on the car,

444
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:42,000
there's likely a video, but here's one thing that demands there's a lot of stuff that I discuss,

445
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,960
that demands it being done on a YouTube or instruct. Well, there's a lot of stuff that

446
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,940
I discussed there is instructional. Okay. And this is one thing that I'll assure you for sure,

447
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,180
you will not be you will not learn how to cook or be good at it by watching any YouTube video

448
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,980
at all. They do not discuss technique. Very rarely give me an example. Recently,

449
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,580
I made sushi, I went out and got a real nice piece of yellowtail and tuna,

450
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,620
sushi grade, and I make really good at making the rice and seasoning it. And so

451
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,700
go out and having some sushi. And it's like, my gosh, I get the bill. And I'm like 50 bucks for

452
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,120
that. That was like bait. You know, if you're fishing, you throw it in the water, you wouldn't

453
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,440
want to eat anyway. So while I'm doing that, I put on some YouTube videos on how to make certain

454
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,300
things. And, and I already know, and I'm watching the guy given instructional, like you watch this

455
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,600
video, you can make sushi at home. And I'm laughing like, No, you do. He's not. He's skipping so many

456
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,980
things. And he's telling you to do this. And that doesn't work. Right? Give an example over and over.

457
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,800
But there are, for example, a really good instructional is, let's say on a 2003,

458
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,060
Chrysler Town and Country minivan guy, you know, changing the water pumps in the title.

459
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,680
And he says, this was this is going to be a video on changing the water pump on this,

460
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,020
on this minivan engine. And we're going to get started right now. But I'm not going to change

461
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,360
it. My girlfriend's going to change it. And you're like, Whoa, cool. You know, she comes out, right?

462
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,460
And she gets in there with the wrench shows you how simple it is. Right? So that was cool. Right?

463
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,420
So you expect a car mechanic video to be the guy and says, yeah, my girlfriend's going to do it.

464
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,620
Not like, you know, a little double whammy there. Right? Yeah. Because of the stereotypes, right?

465
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,380
But he's better off. It's not just because of the stereotype. He's better off because if he takes

466
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,900
somebody who doesn't know how to do it, that's likely who's looking at that video carefully.

467
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:34,280
Sure. Sure. Well, it's less intimidating. It's less intimidating. But also, you know what? Okay.

468
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,400
Somebody who's constantly working with cars is going to skip over stuff because look, I already

469
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,420
know I should have this clean. I should have this ready. I should have these tools out, etc. Now,

470
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,820
new fresh person who has no clue what they're doing does not know that. You know, do I need

471
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,680
a screwdriver? Do I need a wrench? What do I need? You know what I'm saying? Well, let me give an

472
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,780
example. Let's go back to the sushi video that I was watching. Okay, sure. And I'll give a small

473
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,280
example and show the fine point. So this way, when you're watching stuff, you know, once you understand

474
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,280
this fine point, you won't be able to unsee it anymore. But cool. So there he makes a roll,

475
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,960
which is a maki. You know, it's a sea vegetable roll with rice and the fish in the middle.

476
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,160
And it comes time to cut it. And he says, well, when you're cutting the roll,

477
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,300
make sure your knife is kept wet. And he's cutting and cutting and cutting. I said, no,

478
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:29,140
that's keeping the knife wet will only be good for the first cut. You won't be it'll stick on

479
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,960
the second cut. And you'll make a big mess. Everything will stick to the knife and the

480
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,520
roll will break. What you really have to do, which he didn't say was you keep the knife wet. But as

481
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,500
you're making your cut, you have one hand on the knife, obviously, and the other hand on the piece

482
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,480
that you're cutting. And as you're cutting it, you're gently pulling the piece away very gently.

483
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,700
And you repeat when you go to the second piece, you hold the second piece and you gently pull

484
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,560
it away from where it's being cut. So you're right to release the friction. That would be a more

485
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:07,580
proper way. And if you write these little subtle things, you know, that they're not being expressed.

486
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:15,980
That's why I've done actually cooking shows on Skype years ago with certain people. And I didn't

487
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,400
need the camera. They were like, put the camera on, put the camera on, put the camera on. I'm like,

488
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:25,840
no, not necessary. And I would just walk through what I was making. And there'd be no recipes.

489
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:32,140
It would just be the approach, you know, the very subtle things that no one talks about on how to

490
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,600
make whatever we were making. And right. It was much more successful that way.

491
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,520
Yes. Yeah. But again, those things might have been skipped. And, you know, here's the bad part,

492
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,200
too, is that that chef who might be skilled might be doing what you're saying, but he's

493
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,840
not going to bother expressing it. He's not he doesn't know how to communicate well enough.

494
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,440
There's the point like he was actually doing again, cutting the sushi. He says, keep your

495
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,420
knife wet in order to cut it. And he is actually doing what I said. Each time he would cut a piece,

496
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,700
he gently pulls it away from the main part. He didn't express any of that at all.

497
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,420
No, he didn't tell you. Yeah. Even though he was doing it. But it's such a subtle motion that you

498
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,060
won't pick up that he's doing it. It's just like a tiny amount of effort you have to do. You can't

499
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,460
tell it's being done. Right. So. Yeah. So it goes down to how well can can the let's say the

500
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,100
instructor. Right. Or the host or whatever. How well can they communicate? And they can't

501
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,740
communicate that well at all. Right. And that seems to be a very common theme is no matter

502
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,020
what you do, people, even if they're fully aware.
