1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,720
The Sonic Event 84, Rated Y, and here we go.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,200
Why?

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,260
Because...

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,200
Mickey Mouse.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,060
I'm not going there.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,900
Anyway, how are you doing today?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh boy.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,880
Doing okay.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,920
By the way, you know, we haven't brought up the lawful timekeeping in general terms.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,820
We're in the last month of the year for about almost a week, not quite.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,120
We're speaking on the 30th of January, 2024.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,060
And I reckon, I think it was Tuesday, Wednesday, previous, actually, I'll give you a date because

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,060
this is the end of the year.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,020
You know, it's funny how most people just pass it off as whatever, but it's an intelligence

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,440
office.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,800
When I say intelligence office, they've been run by the Jesuits since the 1500s, right?

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,040
And before.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,940
Yeah, right.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,380
I mean, most people think of intelligence as just those things that were established

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,480
by more modern governments, and then it's an offshoot, allegedly not part of it, and you

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,360
know, blah, blah, blah.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,000
And they all play the same game after a while.

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,120
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,220
So let's say around the 23rd or so, it was the change of months, or like I said, a week,

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,780
because it seems like today's the day off, right?

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,020
Okay.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,500
You know, a good way to look at that, but I don't want to pass that by, the intelligence

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,780
off.

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,320
Hold on.

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,300
How about this?

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,240
What is a good way to look at it?

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,560
You have, no matter what the governmental structure is, it's irrelevant as to what language

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,500
it's in or anything else, you have a supposedly governing body, right?

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,840
One way or another recognizes the will of people, either to be accepted as subjects

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,340
or to be part of a democracy or a representative republic or, you know, the democratic republics

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,660
of nonsense that they tell you.

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,380
That's an intelligence off, too.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,840
Whenever you hear revolution or civil war, that's, that's Freemasons, right?

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,640
Oh, yeah, sure.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,100
But supposedly a governing body then comes up with the need to do what?

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,500
Okay.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,780
A good thing that a government could do is collect together resources to create defense

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,300
and an army is built and made and so on and so forth.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,340
And then you need to inform that army.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,640
So often that's the justification for creating a intelligence group.

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,500
And this sort of thing, even though that's not what it's called, has been there ever

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,800
since.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,260
I don't know.

49
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,400
People have decided to organize their little sub societies out there, right?

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,880
These little nation states, these areas that are governed by we're all part of one particular

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,020
geographical area.

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,960
So might as well combine forces and resources.

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
And then intelligence ops grow from it.

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,360
Now, that's the typical understanding of it.

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,640
But there's a spiritual end to this, isn't there?

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,920
Well, yeah.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,740
Well, the spiritual, it's all the same.

58
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,700
Okay.

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,860
Well, we've been talking about this for a long time.

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,580
Last thing I want to get to just real fast, and then I want to hand it to you because

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,020
this is big to me.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,940
You have all sorts of organizations, even when we talked about the hierarchy of the

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,780
gods, right?

64
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,360
Small g.

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,260
Okay.

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,040
You have a whole lot of these entities that all come together and they send intermediaries

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,880
of sorts to collect information, to gather certain things, to create certain things,

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,140
right?

69
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,080
And those things are not necessarily the gods themselves.

70
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,520
They're not representative of you.

71
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,560
They're certainly foreign.

72
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,100
But they go out and there's like intelligence ops among the gods even.

73
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,080
Right?

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,620
I mean, an intelligence op is something that's, yeah, go ahead.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,200
Here's an interesting, most people are well doused in Greek speak.

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,160
Go listen to some of the archaic stuff based on the historical.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,160
You put out some stuff, I'm not endorsing him, but when something's good, we're all

78
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,980
here to learn, right?

79
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,100
So I'm still learning.

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,200
Everybody's learning and we share and that's how we learn.

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,820
And I like some of the stuff that he gets into with the history and how it ties into

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,800
a lot of the holy rites and how I remember being on Revolution Radio back in 2011 or

83
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,820
12 with Seth Michael and other people on these round tables and they would bring up the gods

84
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,040
and I was like, they're just humans, man.

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,360
They're just humans all the way up.

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,860
We don't have anything else.

87
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,080
This is a human creation by humans for humans.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
You know, all that other stuff.

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,400
Right.

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,860
But it doesn't mean the part.

91
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,660
OK, when I talk about the gods, OK, some people think I'm religious or whatever, and

92
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not. I get my law from there because hell, if I'm going to get it from Nancy

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,780
Pelosi or whatever, right, or Ronald Reagan or George Washington or Congress.

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,040
Oh, my gosh. You still must you still help to follow those.

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,240
Right. And you're supposed to.

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,480
So I got my law from there. But the thing that's always irked me now for more than

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,860
two decades is that when people speak on the gods or even let's just say the Bible

98
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,260
or whatever, and you look into what's been memorialized, right, if they say, I say,

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,120
where'd you get that? We got it from the Bible.

100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,140
I'm like, that's not in the Bible.

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,080
So so what's going on is we have like Dmitry Kaluzov calls it the third truth.

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,980
There's three truths. There's the first truth that the people think is true.

103
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,780
Then there's the second truth, which is the administrative, the more the elites think

104
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,940
is true, which is also not, by the way.

105
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,020
Then there's the third truth, which is the best you can do closest to the truth.

106
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,380
You can call the truth. Right.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,360
So it's undeniable.

108
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,840
So, for example, when I used to hear people talk about the biblical stuff, I'm like,

109
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,580
that's not in the Bible. That's not how it goes.

110
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,280
What's this? And because all you got to do is read it.

111
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,180
So it's not it's not special information, even in the piss poor versions that you

112
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,200
have. You talk about anything, whatever you want to bring up.

113
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,600
I'll show you. Read it.

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,060
It's not what it says.

115
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,000
It's pretty easy to the easiest thing about situation type literature.

116
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,780
It has a setting.

117
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,740
So most people are visual kinesthetic, right?

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,900
They can't process the words.

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,420
And, you know, it's a whole other discussion that we've had.

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,140
But visual kinesthetic.

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
So what you do is let's say a scene is described biblically.

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,700
You do. You can actually take the time out and do what's called a storyboard.

123
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,720
Filmmakers do that when they read a script, you know, where they do like a storyboard.

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,560
It's actually a sketch where people are standing and they make description.

125
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,220
It looks almost like a cartoon comic book, you know.

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
Right. Like a comic strip, actually.

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,160
Strip to strip where you see a progression of events.

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,820
Let's draw a picture. And when you read something out of the Bible, it's OK.

129
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
If you don't get it, let's draw a quick picture.

130
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
And you just you could even have to be good at drawing.

131
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,400
Just start sketching things out.

132
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,020
And it's like, isn't this what is being said here?

133
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,740
Isn't what I'm sketch. So why?

134
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,560
Why? Where'd you get? Oh, they told me that at church.

135
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
This is what I believe.

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,360
Oh, my gosh. I've even had Christians say to me, I don't need the Bible to believe.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm like, oh, boy. Well, where are you getting your story from?

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,500
Right. So this is why I got into that.

139
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,400
And that's why I talk about the biological vacuum when it comes to medical stuff.

140
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,960
I mean, how can you trust anyone that tells you the heart is a pump?

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,380
And by the way, a mild tangent.

142
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,620
Any new drugs by this is just like a public advisory.

143
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,280
Yeah. Any new drugs that have come out since 2016?

144
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,700
Because by the way, the twenty nineteen covid thing started around Obama.

145
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,760
I don't know if you remember.

146
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,480
They were ready to vaccinate everyone with the swine flu and everything.

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,100
Almost make it mandatory.

148
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,480
But they didn't. Do you remember that?

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,240
It was like twenty fifteen, twenty sixteen.

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,320
There was a progression for about a decade, actually, of a whole bunch of these

151
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,640
different big threat diseases.

152
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,480
Right. Everything from Zika.

153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,480
Let's go Zika. We'll go Z first.

154
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,500
Yeah. Which which by the way, the Zika was because they had a mosquito problem and

155
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,020
they were spraying insecticides that caused nerve damage, just like polio.

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,580
But anyway, public service announcement from the Greek, any drugs that have been

157
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,360
developed or put on the market since then, 2016 are dangerous.

158
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,920
Doesn't matter what it's for, whether it's an antibiotic, a painkiller

159
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,720
treatment for restless leg syndrome, urinary this.

160
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,200
Do not take any.

161
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,440
If you're going to go with any pharmaceutical, make sure it's something that's

162
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,500
like first or second gen, more than 20 year old formula.

163
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,100
Do not repeat.

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,220
Do not with a capital T have any drugs that were developed more less

165
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,400
than 20 years ago administered to you at all.

166
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,000
It doesn't matter what it is. They are dangerous poisons.

167
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,180
They do absolutely nothing but harm the body.

168
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,140
Now, it's very rare that I give such a discreet public information

169
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,280
announcement. And I mean it, you know, a moment of silence.

170
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,940
I really mean that. Do not take any medicines that have been developed after,

171
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,940
let's say, 2000.

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
So if you feel like you have to do, let's say, an antibiotic, do a penicillin

173
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,340
or amoxicillin. And as a matter of fact, there are a lot of articles written 10

174
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,500
years ago about how dangerous antibiotics are.

175
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,360
They don't do anything other than destroy the body.

176
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
So I just wanted to bring this up.

177
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,500
It's pretty bad.

178
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,100
And even without saying this, you should have an intuitive feeling about it.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,460
Since what happened in 2019, 2020, you should know this right now.

180
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,760
Right. So but anyway, to go back to what I was saying,

181
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,900
when I heard stuff in the religious circles and when I say religious circles,

182
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,920
I'm talking about Islam also.

183
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,120
I was like, that's not in anything that where are you getting that right?

184
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,480
Even Buddhism, where are you getting that?

185
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,360
I mean, so what I became a stickler for is if we're going to talk on a subject

186
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,020
and that subject relies very heavily on reference material, i.e.

187
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,720
literary material, stuff that's been memorialized and praised to be containing

188
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,100
the information, you do not have license to deviate.

189
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,400
Right. You can't start making stuff up.

190
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,340
And that's what's going on. It doesn't matter if it's medical.

191
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,880
It doesn't matter if it's scientific.

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,780
I always gave the analogy.

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,380
It doesn't matter how powerful of a microscope you have.

194
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,700
If you cut a wire with electrons flowing through it and you have a dustpan ready to

195
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,400
sweep up the electrons, you will never find any electrons there.

196
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,680
It's all bullshit.

197
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,040
There's nothing flowing in those wires.

198
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,400
Right. So I've tried to explain this regarding what they call paganism,

199
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,560
whatever, the multifaceted universe of that stuff.

200
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,720
There is this paganism, by the way, from from a proper point of view.

201
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,420
I always knock it because I try to drive a wedge between the thinking of a man

202
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,720
of a man or a woman or a human or person, let's say, of the people

203
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,600
between what they're handling, because most people are able to handle

204
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,360
two thoughts that contradict each other at once and then and they mix them.

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,980
And that shouldn't be done. Right. Right.

206
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,840
Well, so but real paganism is just polytheism, which is also biblical, by the

207
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,560
way. Yes, because it says do not worship other gods.

208
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,440
Well, if there are no other gods, why would you say that?

209
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,860
That's totally redundant and stupid.

210
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,040
But I don't really go down that road because it does.

211
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,020
It sounds like I'm more being apologetic and a mediator.

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,300
People do not need that.

213
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,000
They need to be hit across the head with a wet newspaper to wake them up.

214
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,580
No, but even the people that say that they are steeped in paganism, to be honest

215
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,040
with you, they have deviated from all of the standards by which they're swearing

216
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,820
by exactly in the same way anybody does who is a Christian or a

217
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,380
Jew or a, you know, or or what is that?

218
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,660
A member of the nation of Islam, whatever it is, Islamic.

219
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,080
Sure. But but here's the thing about that entire subject.

220
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,420
We don't know what I've been harping on is that if you are

221
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,740
leaning either towards the Islam or, you know, the Judeo-Christian

222
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,280
side as your model for law, because that's really the only reason to go there,

223
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,460
by the way, is to figure out what what's right, what's wrong.

224
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,420
Right. Based on your culture.

225
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,440
And you must go back to the founding document

226
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,320
at least. Right. You know, you hear that a lot in the Patriot community.

227
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,700
It's the same thing.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,320
So what I started off with, if you want to get more of a handle on the

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,660
chronology, archaics has got it pretty tight.

230
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,160
It actually opened my eyes to a lot of the stuff that I went back and knew

231
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,480
about, but did not research.

232
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,160
And I'm slowly looking into it again.

233
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,540
And it is true that the biblical text did exist.

234
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,160
It's a it's a compilation of other writings put together.

235
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,260
But it doesn't matter if you don't know it.

236
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,900
So like someone like archaics, he really doesn't know the Bible.

237
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,420
He says he's read it 40 times.

238
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
He has the notes to prove it. But he really didn't.

239
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,440
He read it once. Forty times is the difference.

240
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,060
Right. Right.

241
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,900
So it's like saying you have 30 years experience.

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,240
No, you have one year experience.

243
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,060
You just keep doing the same thing over and over.

244
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
No, you don't. He doesn't even know it.

245
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,240
And he has the whole thing on dark scriptures and whatever.

246
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,840
It's not wholly accurate. He drifts away and confabulates.

247
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,920
That's fine, because if you put him against the wall, he'll say, well,

248
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
I'm just a chronologist. Right.

249
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,400
But he's delves in all these other things. Right.

250
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,360
And that's OK. But you have to understand how untidy he can get.

251
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,140
I'm not knocking him, but I'm not endorsing him either.

252
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,900
The chronology is tight.

253
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,580
And what's important about that is if you study the chronology

254
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,200
and how the Greek gods came about, they were people.

255
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,500
Right. If you study these gods, they were people.

256
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,520
If you study the Bible, they were people, all of them.

257
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
We have when it comes to the divine,

258
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,720
the closest thing that I could sum up if it was going to be my last words is this.

259
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm a big fan of Tesla, but he's not like a demigod,

260
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,260
like a lot of people put him, because a lot of the stuff that he designed

261
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
really didn't work.

262
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,140
Not until Steinmetz came around 20 years later.

263
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,540
It wasn't for Steinmetz.

264
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,280
The AC motors that Tesla did would would not be working.

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,180
They exploded because he used solid cores.

266
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,560
He didn't use laminates and all that.

267
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,860
So anyway, this is a whole other thing.

268
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,600
He didn't know about the the fusion math that was necessary,

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,920
where you pull and derive

270
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,800
from another dimension in all this.

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,860
Tesla didn't do that.

272
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,540
But to go back to Tesla, I'd venerate him from this.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,280
He says that the mind does not think it is connected

274
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,820
to a central core in the universe somewhere.

275
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,060
And he's always trying to pull from that, you know, ideas, thoughts, inspirations.

276
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,840
He doesn't know what the core is, but he knows it exists.

277
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,680
That's what that's where I put as my belief.

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,180
Now, some people some people describe that as the Akashic Library

279
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,520
and this kind of thing on and on, but no one can prove it.

280
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
But we know it exists. Here's the thing.

281
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
Right. We could talk about the Akashic Library.

282
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,360
But if someone argued that it doesn't exist, you'd have to agree.

283
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,800
But if someone but you couldn't argue that something like that does not exist,

284
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,680
you can't because it's so obvious that something like that exists.

285
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,420
But to make it so specific, it's this and this and this.

286
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,260
I don't know about that.

287
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,660
But does something like that exist? Absolutely. Yeah.

288
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Again, like like Tesla said, we do not think we extract

289
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,780
from a core in the universe somewhere.

290
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,300
But with this, he doesn't know what it is, but he knows we're extracting from it.

291
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,280
Right. With this certainty, you can prove that information travels

292
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,680
without the benefit of conventional roadways for it to travel on. Right.

293
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,640
I mean, even the twelve. Yeah.

294
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,320
Sure. But here there's OK.

295
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,320
You know what I'm saying?

296
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,640
The twelve monkeys thing where you end up with the monkeys who learn something,

297
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,940
even though they've never been connected to the monkeys on the other.

298
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,860
That's actually I heard a lot of just contrary things.

299
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,100
I heard that was just urban myth that didn't happen.

300
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,820
But yes, that's good enough, even if it didn't happen.

301
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,680
Just like the lemmings never happened.

302
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
You know, they were thrown off the cliff.

303
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,140
They didn't go off on their own, supposedly.

304
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,320
But yes, those are analogies and metaphors that we use

305
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,380
to sustain some form of rationale.

306
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,660
Right. One way or another, information does travel.

307
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,380
And it's not because it was spoken directly or written down.

308
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,680
It does travel from one place to another.

309
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,840
And sometimes people would say it's carried by a muse.

310
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,940
It's carried by this information superhighway of a spiritual sense.

311
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,240
It is part of the Christ consciousness.

312
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,000
It is part of, you know, we could go on for thousands of years on that

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,460
because that's what's been going on.

314
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,840
But if you start dissecting it chronologically,

315
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,040
you'll see that all of the entities, biblical or non-biblical, are all human.

316
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,220
As a matter of fact, even if you don't believe in Exodus 15, it says Yahweh is a man.

317
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,700
And I was doing a study on Exodus with a Hebrew speaker, someone raised in Israel.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,660
And he says, no, no, not really.

319
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
And he goes to reads it in Hebrew and says it's ish.

320
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,480
And he's like, oh, my gosh, it is ish.

321
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,640
Right. Meaning it's it's a man, man.

322
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,560
Meaning that's not, you know, it's an ish is it means carnal.

323
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,180
So, you know, and I've been saying since the longest time the gods.

324
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,040
Are just super high tech, whatever.

325
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Imagine meeting someone that has a technology a million years ahead of you.

326
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,760
A million years ago.

327
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
Oh, my gosh. Of course, you're a god.

328
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,500
We use that term very loosely and it's fine.

329
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,160
But we draw from a place

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
that we do not know enough exactitude, but we know we're drawing from it.

331
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,600
It's good enough.

332
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,760
Just like when you go buy bottled water because you don't want to drink tap water.

333
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,740
You know, it's better than tap water.

334
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,060
Do you know exactly how it was processed and exactly?

335
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,940
No, but you know, it's better. Right.

336
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,220
So you lean towards that. Right. Right.

337
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,060
So it's the same thing.

338
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,400
One thing that people get really confused on is their ability.

339
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,079
They cap off their they create their own limits

340
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,900
and they get confused about how to deal with that.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,060
Again, something brochures from our Kickstarter because of dungeon programming.

342
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,099
I really like that.

343
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,260
It's like you're programmed to be in a dungeon.

344
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
And there's an old analogy.

345
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,079
If you were born in a jail cell and I've done this with dogs, by the way,

346
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,900
with kennels, if you all you knew was a jail cell,

347
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,260
if you went out into the world and you felt there was trouble,

348
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,720
guess where you're going to run for safety.

349
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
So you're going to run right in the jail and close the door.

350
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,240
That's why whenever I had a dog, I always first day I got him,

351
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,600
put him in the kennel, fed him in the kennel, loved him in the kennel.

352
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,020
Came time to night, go in the kennel.

353
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,860
If I gave a command to go to the kennel, he went into the kennel.

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,040
That was good for the dog.

355
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,860
Wouldn't get in trouble that way. Right.

356
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,940
And he went into the kennel by himself.

357
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,060
I had one dog was just a lovely dog.

358
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,240
I said, oh, he's too cute.

359
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,100
Come in the bed with me.

360
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Guess what? After a month of sleeping without no way I'm getting in the kennel.

361
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,300
Right. Right. So.

362
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,480
So, I mean, love can spoil something also.

363
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,520
From that perspective, you know, what is love?

364
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,580
Right. Doing the right thing.

365
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,660
In that case, it would have that was not really love

366
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,460
because the best thing would have been kept the dog trained for the kennel.

367
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,460
But for humans, for some humans, if not most humans,

368
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
that dungeon program is it works.

369
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,060
It's best for them to feel safe in the jail that they're in.

370
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,860
And I've tested this, by the way. Right.

371
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,000
They get really angry if you poke at that concept.

372
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,740
And that's just the way things are.

373
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,840
And that's fine. Accept it.

374
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,780
But the thing I want to say most people have a hard time with

375
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,120
is how to remove the cap that they put on themselves, the limit.

376
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,980
Most people have limitations.

377
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,040
And it's beyond the jail cell safety or the dungeon programming.

378
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,240
It's the way they perceive things.

379
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,760
Like, for example, mostly I remember we did a thing

380
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,960
where I talked about, you know, well, someone said, you find out about that.

381
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,020
No, I'm not interested in that subject.

382
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
You know, people say, oh, I'm not interested in that. Right.

383
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm interested. Oh, my gosh.

384
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,780
As a human being, as one of the people

385
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,040
and what the faculties that you have in connection to the core,

386
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,880
you can or may be interested in everything, everything.

387
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,980
OK, to say it this way, everyone should be interested in everything

388
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,480
and what depth of matter and breadth of the matter

389
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,400
and how much time you dedicate to it is another issue.

390
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,080
But for someone to completely dismiss something that they actually interact with.

391
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,540
As because they're not interested is a cap and a limit

392
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,300
that was somehow placed on them. Right.

393
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,380
And what you will find is one thing transfers to another.

394
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,020
I was on a long call about building scalerators.

395
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,300
And I said, if you've never built anything like this,

396
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,500
go put on a YouTube on how cars are made and just watch it.

397
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,860
You'll see the metal being pressed, painted, fitted.

398
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,620
One certain things are put in and whatever.

399
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,740
It's the same exact mindset.

400
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,400
It doesn't matter if you're building something with two parts

401
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,220
or something with 2000 parts productions, production, manufacturing,

402
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
building stuff is building stuff. It doesn't matter.

403
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,520
If you watch a house be a modern house being built or a straw hut,

404
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,200
the principle is exactly the same.

405
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,860
So transfer. But I'm not interested.

406
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,680
OK, the moment you hear I'm not interested the right way.

407
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,720
What the person is expressing is they put a cap and a limit

408
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,760
self-contained on themselves.

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,580
And that's that's a self-inflicted wound, I call it. Right.

410
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,720
That that leads to trauma, personal trauma.

411
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,320
So you want to deal with that?

412
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,000
No, I think you should skip that one and go to the next one.

413
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,860
No, but in defense, in defense of that person, though,

414
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,960
in defense of that mindset, isn't there a point at which some things

415
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,940
you could say are just good enough, like the bottled water?

416
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,380
And I really want to focus my energy, my effort, my time on other things.

417
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,460
Maybe they don't want to know.

418
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,100
But hold on. That's not what I'm saying.

419
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,660
I'm saying that the person dismisses it completely

420
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,240
by just simply saying not interested, just like when the person says,

421
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm not good at math. Oh, that's fine. That's OK.

422
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,040
There's plenty of good people not good at math.

423
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,300
How they arrived to that is because of laziness.

424
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,880
And by the way, when someone says, I'm not good at this.

425
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,280
Well, gosh, you know, you're not good at that's what you should be working on.

426
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,260
Right. Because if it came up now, it'll come up again.

427
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,740
For example, when I used to train in bicycle racing

428
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,600
and everyone gets together, the person who was good at hill climbing,

429
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,000
when we got to the hill, they went up the hill real fast.

430
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,660
When it came to sprinting, the people that were good at sprinting

431
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,140
sprinted realized, what are you guys doing?

432
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,000
What are you doing? This is training, right?

433
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,620
You should train what you're weak in.

434
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,980
Don't train what you already know you're strong in.

435
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,780
Why don't you? So the sprinter.

436
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,320
Why don't you train the hill now? Go ahead.

437
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,420
We're not going to laugh at you.

438
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,220
We know you can't climb, but this is a training ride.

439
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,780
This is the time where you train your weakness and you perform with your strength.

440
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,300
So what's going on?

441
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,360
And I've been noticed that people are performing

442
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,220
when they're flashing all their weaknesses and their strengths.

443
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,260
And by the way, they're not allowed to flash their strengths,

444
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,540
because if you start showing that all that person thinks is full of himself.

445
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,220
Right. But when you flash your weakness.

446
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
Oh, that's OK. You're fine.

447
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,520
Oh, my gosh.

448
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,180
So there's a metamorphosis that takes place.

449
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,360
And when I say metamorphosis versus transition, because a metamorphosis

450
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,260
is when you see one thing in one stage and you see the second stage that it goes to,

451
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,420
it doesn't the second stage sometimes may not even resemble anything.

452
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,400
Right. Like a butterfly, a caterpillar going to a butterfly is called metamorphosis.

453
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,060
Right. There's no relation.

454
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,900
If you show someone who's not familiar with that creature, a caterpillar

455
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,220
and a butterfly, they cannot even intuit that it was the same thing at one point.

456
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,660
Right. So it's a metamorphosis.

457
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,740
And this is how fast change comes when you're connected to the core

458
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,540
or the divine or the inspiration.

459
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,480
And we've talked about how the inspiration, the idea, the inspiration,

460
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,620
the thought, the manifestation works.

461
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,180
And what all I see, by the way, is people's limitations

462
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,840
when they not. That's not all I see.

463
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,580
Let me take that back.

464
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,920
It's very easy for me to see what people are like flashing like a badge,

465
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,340
their limitations instead of dealing with them. Right.

466
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,860
Now, one thing I had a conversation similar to this with someone recently said,

467
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,740
well, we're technologically advanced now.

468
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,160
We can change. I said, no, you're not.

469
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,220
Just because this is the real definition of technologically advanced society.

470
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,340
And I'll show you. I'll prove this just because everyone has a computer

471
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,440
and a camera that also acts as a phone doesn't mean you're technologically

472
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,480
advanced, because ninety nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,

473
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,560
nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent of the people.

474
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,760
If you took the phone and asked them, can you show me how to make this phone

475
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,640
from raw materials? They can't.

476
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,000
In other words, if you went to the zoo and to the gorilla monkey primates

477
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,340
and you gave each one of them a cell phone, would you call them

478
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,560
technologically advanced? No.

479
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,940
So why are you calling people technology?

480
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,980
If you went to them, you gave every monkey a cell phone,

481
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,440
Jim, orangutan, gorilla.

482
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,460
You wouldn't call them technologically.

483
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,140
And it's why what they could you could train them to use it just as well.

484
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm sure they even have apps for monkeys now.

485
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Now, OK, I'm sure they'll get into the camera part real quick.

486
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,360
But anyway, selfies especially get it.

487
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,100
So the monkeys with the cell phones is no different than the humans

488
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,020
with the cell phones.

489
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,520
They're not any less or more advanced, either one.

490
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,900
So why are you calling people?

491
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,280
Tell me again, how are you calling them technically advanced person?

492
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,300
Just shut up right away.

493
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,320
And this is a professional person in psychology.

494
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
Right. Shut her ass up right away.

495
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,640
And she got it.

496
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,980
She got it, though, because she's trained to form new ideas.

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,920
This is a new idea because the monkey cannot.

498
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,160
And then you could say, well, there are people who made the cell phone.

499
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,700
Yeah, we presume there's someone designed it and built it.

500
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,000
But very, very, very, very, very few.

501
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
So a more accurate statement would be that amongst humans,

502
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,400
there are some that are very technologically advanced,

503
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,780
so advanced that they are able to compile enough raw material

504
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,440
in an engineering fashion to produce this device. Right.

505
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,520
Wow. A very how many people can from from soup to nuts,

506
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,660
in other words, take the raw material and have the knowledge, even a group.

507
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,000
Well, I'm not expecting one person, a group of people

508
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,520
in the whole population that can do that.

509
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,460
Take it from raw plastic, silicone, glass, metal, whatever.

510
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,720
Silver, gold, you need whatever plastics and make a finished cell phone.

511
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,040
Very few people.

512
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,860
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very few people

513
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,680
can do that from soup to nuts. Right.

514
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,720
Probably about as many people could do that as as many dogs could take

515
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,900
an unloaded firearm, load it up and utilize. Yeah, it's very.

516
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,300
So why are you putting there?

517
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,500
Why are you bestowing their virtues on the entire population?

518
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,280
You see, you can't do that. Oh, right.

519
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,240
So so this is what's going on.

520
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,420
And this is what I'm stating when.

521
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,540
So when you're taking interest in a cell phone, am I demanding

522
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,840
that you know how to take raw materials and make a finished cell phone? No.

523
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,340
But know what you can do and can't do and express it properly.

524
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,640
Put everything in its proper magnitude, what you can do.

525
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,900
Like if you like playing golf, you may not go to the World Championships.

526
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,840
You like running. You're not going to run in the Olympics.

527
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,920
It's fine to know and express your limits, but don't do it without warrant.

528
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,360
Well, it's just like people tell me nowadays, you know, like people

529
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,800
are just generally more knowledgeable than they've ever been.

530
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,080
I say, no, they're not, because they have access.

531
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Sure. A lot of people, you know, have plenty of access to, you know,

532
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,000
information that is beyond belief, but it doesn't mean that they utilize.

533
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,500
Well, actually, some of the information is beyond belief

534
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,840
because it just simply isn't true.

535
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Well, you study the entire medical industry.

536
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,220
It's all fiction right now.

537
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,040
But just like you and I have discussed before, within the lie,

538
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,880
you can learn the truth because you can learn to eliminate what is clearly a lie.

539
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,040
Yeah, to to a degree.

540
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,900
But I'm telling you, on a personal level, I'm finding it to get really bad right now.

541
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,500
The level of disinformation is in the 80 to 90 percent range.

542
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,220
It's really bad.

543
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,500
Unless again, you go where old books.

544
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,080
I'm well, how many times have you heard me say in Sonic

545
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,860
that everything that could have been known was already known by the 1890s?

546
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,380
So that's why you've said many times

547
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,540
the only books of value are the ones that were printed, you know, before nineteen

548
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,440
hundred or before 1920, for sure, before World War One would have been the cutoff.

549
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,080
Some people say later, I've seen some things up until the 1950s,

550
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,760
but you can feel it and taste it.

551
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,700
You can tell something has gone wrong.

552
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,300
Yeah, absolutely.

553
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,720
Now, but the metamorphosis, my point is, even if you could put someone

554
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,740
in a giant library that was the size of, you know, the old New York libraries

555
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,780
that were huge, I don't know if they still exist like this. They don't.

556
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,760
Well, they were they don't.

557
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,660
I mean, they were large buildings that contained books

558
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,000
from one end to the other, books loaded with all kinds of information.

559
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,280
You stick somebody in there, though, and they don't read any of it.

560
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,820
It did no good.

561
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,400
You know what I'm saying?

562
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,080
So just because they have access to it, they have access to tools.

563
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,380
They have access to knowledge.

564
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,040
It does not mean that they interacted with it or gained any of it.

565
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,300
Well, yeah, they have archives, but the public is not interested.

566
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,820
It's kind of like the money system.

567
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,880
You know, you talk to anyone about the money system, even affluent people,

568
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,520
like, oh, no, I like all the points I get on my credit card.

569
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,300
Oh, my gosh.

570
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,020
There is no way they will.

571
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,260
They will understand what they're actually doing, their own destruction. Right.

572
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,040
A lot of the ancient texts talk about you.

573
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,600
Basically, when destruction comes, you brought it upon yourself.

574
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,540
And I see that.

575
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,660
But what I want to say, there's a metamorphosis, in other words,

576
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,300
when one understands how to relieve certain things

577
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,720
and approach certain things in a more proper way.

578
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,440
The difference is not gradual.

579
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,160
You literally go from a caterpillar to a butterfly almost instantly.

580
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,360
You transform yourself very quickly.

581
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,600
And by the way, it's not very popular to do that.

582
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,680
You do see that when certain people, let's say,

583
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,460
you know, you hear about some guy, you know, I'm a born again Christian now.

584
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,480
And you're completely and they're completely different. Right.

585
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,580
They from one day to the next. Right.

586
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,840
Oh, I went to this meeting and it changed me.

587
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,400
You know, and then they decide to go.

588
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,300
There was no transition there.

589
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,980
You know, right.

590
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,300
There was a they just changed completely and they stuck with it. Right. Right.

591
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,780
This is possible with all people at any time

592
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,180
if they allow it and they consider it.

593
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,760
Now, the the thing about the mind to go back to being attached to the core,

594
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,820
we are extremely limited in that sense that I think in one of the Sonics

595
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,600
I brought up the process that John Mase uses

596
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,460
that it's very similar to what I talked about in Greek speak.

597
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,960
But he made a package of it package deal kind of thing.

598
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,380
That we only see images.

599
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,180
We think of images. We only remember images.

600
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,840
The key, you know, you might think you remember a past event,

601
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,360
but you're actually it's just images.

602
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,640
It's just like if you're looking at a film, if you freeze it and stop it,

603
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,760
even digitally frames per second, it's just a series of frames

604
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,980
running in sequence we call time.

605
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,740
So there's still just images, right?

606
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,840
Everything is a still image.

607
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,760
And recently I'll do this with everyone.

608
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,560
Someone contacted me about

609
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,600
do I have a way of dealing with grief?

610
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,140
And and I was like, yeah, it's a very simple one.

611
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,980
And so we'll get in touch soon.

612
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,020
And I'll share this with everyone right now.

613
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,660
This is this is what we're going to do.

614
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Basically, the John Mase method and also taking advantage

615
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,040
of how the brain simply works, just like, for example, it's simple.

616
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,860
It's not a mystery.

617
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,380
If someone drives a car and it suddenly turns off

618
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,800
and the temperature meter is all the way high.

619
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,400
And to them, they driving a car is a ritual.

620
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,020
They don't know what just happened. It shuts down.

621
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,620
Well, if someone knows that the car has some it relies on the radiator

622
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,800
or the coolant fluid, if it's a water cooled, that the water pump went bad

623
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,760
or they broke a piston rod one or the other or whatever and seized up the engine.

624
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,640
They can apply techno technically, very technically.

625
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,460
If you want to fix that, it's fixable.

626
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,040
Where the person who doesn't know that that's what it is to them,

627
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,180
they're baffled and they could spend the next 20 years trying to figure out

628
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,200
asking other people that don't know how it works, what happened.

629
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,580
And they won't come up with an answer.

630
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,320
But if you go to someone who knows the car mechanics inside and out right away,

631
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,020
he has an answer and a fix for you.

632
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,140
See, that's what I'm referring to with this John Mase method, Mase method.

633
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,760
And it's Mase, M.A.C.E.

634
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,460
with the brain only records images, meaning stills,

635
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,920
even though like the most popular thing is especially remember in the 80s

636
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,740
all these 1980s, late 70s,

637
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,700
there were a lot of these designer perfumes and colognes

638
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,880
becoming popular for the first time before that.

639
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,080
You got aftershave and Chanel number five, and that's it.

640
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,180
Right. There was a big boom of like Ralph Lauren and this and that.

641
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,560
Remember Paco Rabanne and Aramis and all these all suddenly

642
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,340
there was an explosion in the population for designer colognes that were

643
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,840
and perfumes that were accessible to the public and the public took interest.

644
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,300
And there was like one.

645
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,760
I remember that even you don't smell it much, but when you smell it now,

646
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,780
it takes me right back to the 80s.

647
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,180
The smell immediately takes me back.

648
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,980
And I remember where I was, what I was doing more than if you asked me

649
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,220
to think about that time.

650
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
It's like a stimulus or an impulse.

651
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,320
Now is so the smell can also be recorded as a still image,

652
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,700
because I didn't say it was the smell, this, that and the other.

653
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
It was just the smell that did it.

654
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,220
So saying that the mind only remembers and recalls still images

655
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,280
still holds true for something like that, because it was just the smell that did it.

656
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,640
Yeah. I'll give you another common trigger.

657
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,580
Right. When you smell a particular food

658
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,460
that was prepared at a special event at some point in time,

659
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
like maybe you smell, I don't know.

660
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,420
Let's just go with the easy thing.

661
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,320
Thanksgiving stuffing, stuffing.

662
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,220
You don't usually smell in people's houses or dressing.

663
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,820
If you're west of the Mississippi.

664
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,180
There you go. All right.

665
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,680
So those two things, when you smell them and it smells very similar

666
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,360
to like what you smelled at your grandmother's house,

667
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,500
all of a sudden you go back to a time.

668
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,500
Sure. Everything.

669
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,520
What I hate the most, by the way, about smells is I like to burn

670
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,540
frankincense and myrrh in the house for many reasons.

671
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,640
Frankincense and myrrh, the smoke is a resin and it will leave a microscopic

672
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,060
nanolayer of resin on the walls, which is extremely antiseptic.

673
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,620
Let's just say what I don't like about burning it is being forced

674
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,580
to go to a Greek Orthodox church when they burned it back then.

675
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,860
And it brings back that memory.

676
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,520
And I've worked that out.

677
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,440
And I'm going to talk a little bit more on how to work out these impulses,

678
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,740
which are stills, whether it's a smell, a smell.

679
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Analogy I gave because I was thinking I brought up

680
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,420
how the brain thinks in still images, even if you remember

681
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,380
an event is just a compiled still images and think about

682
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
10 or 20 years, a significant event.

683
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,700
Try to think of that event in motion.

684
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,840
You will not be continuous.

685
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,880
You will see images, successive images.

686
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,700
You cannot really recall a fluid event like you would see run in a film.

687
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,920
It will be just successive images.

688
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,220
On one part of a thought, you're standing on this side of the room.

689
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,920
The next thought you're on the other side of the room.

690
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,500
How did you get there?

691
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,760
Because it's another still.

692
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,860
You see what it's like.

693
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,460
And it's fragmented slides. Yeah.

694
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,120
So the smells and other impulses and words are the same thing.

695
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,699
So if you, let's say, had a gang of people you hung out with gang,

696
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,639
meaning like the old way, a group of people and they had a nickname for you

697
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,420
and you haven't heard it in 30 years.

698
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,840
And suddenly you hear that again.

699
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,900
It takes you right back to that.

700
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,400
You know, when you were roofing, roofing was

701
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,659
we'd go in the back of neighborhoods and the garages were next to each other.

702
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,219
We jumped from garage roof to garage roof to garage roof.

703
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,460
Whoever got to the end of the block first that way,

704
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,320
we know was the challenge, you know, the one to challenge.

705
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,080
And it was dangerous

706
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,440
because sometimes the gaps between the roofs got really wide.

707
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,060
And if you fell, you can break a leg, right?

708
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,000
That's not fun.

709
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,800
It's not fun at 10 years old or 11.

710
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,440
So, you know, so all of these things, you know, again, are still it's just one word.

711
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,900
It's just one smell. It's it's the same as a still.

712
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,040
So to go back with someone who asked me, how do we deal with grief?

713
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,200
I said, you have a way. I said, yes, we'll get in touch soon.

714
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,500
So this I'll use the John Mace method application. We'll do this here.

715
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,160
Oh, yeah. And this works with everyone.

716
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,220
One other random reminder that people be able to relate to easily,

717
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,140
though, is the smell of popcorn or and the smell of that artificial butter.

718
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,560
Oh, yeah. Or a fart.

719
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,640
You know, whatever. Rotten eggs.

720
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,060
You know, yeah, I got a lot of memories tied to farts.

721
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,560
But, you know, when it comes to popcorn, I'm thinking that's one of those things,

722
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,320
though, that they actually use.

723
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,580
You know, when you go to I know a lot of people don't go to movie theaters anymore.

724
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,520
But I'm guaranteeing that if somebody hears me say,

725
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,260
think of the smell of buttered popcorn, you're automatically

726
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,560
snapped to a movie theater or something.

727
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,040
Sure. Yeah. But it's infinite.

728
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,280
Everything, everything you ever will be held this way.

729
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,720
And it's very sounds very reductionist to say that that everything is a single.

730
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,640
Yeah, well, slide.

731
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,980
I'm just given what it is like, not necessarily, you know, crazy, but very relatable.

732
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,440
I think everybody smelled that buttered popcorn deal.

733
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Sure. But let's go back to the concept of Tesla saying that we don't really think

734
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,100
we access the central core in the universe.

735
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,400
He doesn't know what it is, but he knows he's access.

736
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,680
Right. Absolutely.

737
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,000
So we can't get any simpler than that.

738
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,820
And we can't we can't get more exact, really, without any difficulty

739
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,020
or privileged knowledge.

740
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,580
So we can reduce not to just say that's the truth and that's it.

741
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,400
It's almost too reductionist, but it works.

742
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,020
Just like this method here where everything is instilled is very reductionist.

743
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,700
By the way, it's completely rejected by the psychology community because it works

744
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,160
and it works every time.

745
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,000
If you do it well, even with people that had severe traumatic experiences

746
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
that have been going through psychologists and whatever

747
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,740
psychiatrists for all their life and can't knock it.

748
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,480
This will knock it every time if you do it properly.

749
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,220
And this is I'm not trained in this, but I'm going to give an example on how well

750
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,440
it works, because someone approached me.

751
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,160
Can they how do you deal with grief?

752
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,820
And I said, fine, we'll we'll be very quick and we'll deal with it.

753
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,120
This is fine. So we haven't done this yet, but I'm going to do it here on the Sonic.

754
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,860
So whoever's listening, if you ever had any grief

755
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,180
that you still hold on to or imagined or have a feeling of,

756
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,920
then you consider a grievous event.

757
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,360
Right. Think of it and what you'll see is an image.

758
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,940
It could be a person in a setting, a place.

759
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,440
It could even be pop, buttered popcorn.

760
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,900
And now if you have that image, when you thought of grief is emo.

761
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,440
Also, you know how the emo is very much the emotion of grief will bring up an image

762
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,860
almost like opening a Rolodex file.

763
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,120
And and you might jitter between one or two images.

764
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
Let it jitter back and forth.

765
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,980
It might be multiple images.

766
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,340
Let it settle in in your mind.

767
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,720
And what will happen is some of those images will fade away.

768
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,780
You'll be left with one.

769
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,600
Believe it or not.

770
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,360
Does this work because you bring up the subject and think of an image

771
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,700
when you bring up the emotion of grief.

772
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,040
Some people have a lot of images.

773
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,100
That's OK. Some people, you know, just let it sit.

774
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,900
And they're going to fade away and you'll be left with one.

775
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,460
Believe it or not, one kind of goes to the top of the pile.

776
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,100
So it's exactly right.

777
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,760
And it always some people, it takes a few seconds and people, it takes a few minutes.

778
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,940
And when you feel like you ask them, do you have just one image now?

779
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,480
Yes. Now we get now we get time to get to work.

780
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,780
You don't have to say what it is, by the way.

781
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,860
OK, it's all personal.

782
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,740
This is all personal.

783
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,940
I'm doing no one has to disclose anything.

784
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,360
Just so you know, I'm doing this one.

785
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,880
You should be. OK.

786
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,100
Anyway. Yeah, I don't mean that sarcastically, but it works more.

787
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,520
It has 70 percent more effect when you're doing it.

788
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,240
And so you'll see. So let it settle in.

789
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,380
And when you get a feeling that there's just one image left, you don't have to.

790
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,340
This is different than regular psychology where they make you talk about it.

791
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,620
No, this is totally the wrong way.

792
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,340
This is keeping a confidential works the best.

793
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,980
Well, it seems like if the trouble's internal, perhaps that is where you're

794
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,740
keeping it internal.

795
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,640
But you don't have the modern psychology.

796
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,540
They want you to let it out, say, talk about it.

797
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,900
No, that's completely the wrong way to go.

798
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,140
It has a place.

799
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,200
It should be kept personal because it's going to be dealt with personal.

800
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,700
It has a place to vent it.

801
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,000
It's sort of like a chiropractor.

802
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,120
It's nice to sort of adjust things temporarily.

803
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
But never actually solves the situation with this method.

804
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,860
You never ask the person what it is.

805
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,020
It's irrelevant, really, because this is we're dealing with the core

806
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,200
part of the way the mind works, not the subject matter.

807
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,580
Right. And so once you settle in on an image of grief, whatever it might be,

808
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,060
and all the other ones have washed away, look at that image and expand it.

809
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
And let it expand.

810
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
Just order it to get bigger.

811
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,260
Now, whatever that image is of, it could be buttered popcorn, your stepdad,

812
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,240
a teacher, a bully.

813
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Let that image just ask the image to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

814
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,860
And you'll notice in your mind, it starts to zoom.

815
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,080
You zoom in on it or it gets really big.

816
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,480
Everyone has a different experience with it.

817
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,320
It's going to be some people experience it zooming in like you zoom in on a screen.

818
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,900
Other people feel like it's enveloping them and filling the room.

819
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,440
So, you know, that's the thing is I have actually two ways

820
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,740
I can go with this in my mind either. That's OK.

821
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,160
You don't have to say it. Let me let me just go on.

822
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,440
Hold on. I'm going to step on you.

823
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,120
It's important that you don't express any personal

824
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,900
because I'm trying to make this more objective.

825
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,880
Some people will feel that it's just the image zooming in like you zoom in on a screen.

826
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,120
Other people feel like it's filling the room three dimensional.

827
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,400
Other people feel like now they're in another place

828
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,720
out in an open desert or field and it's filling the entire planet.

829
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,000
That's OK. In other words.

830
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,660
Remember, it's just an image that you asked for it to get bigger.

831
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,560
And you will compile that again with another image.

832
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,360
You might be, you know, again, it might look like a screen

833
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,360
or it might be filling the room or you might feel like you were taken to another place

834
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,180
and it's filling the whole universe.

835
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,120
It doesn't matter the same image.

836
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,960
OK. At one point, you asked it to expand.

837
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,140
Now it will stop expanding and go static in that gigantic state.

838
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,840
It may not be gigantic for some people.

839
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,740
It might just be like a 10 foot wide billboard for some people.

840
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,280
Other people have said that it's if I'm out in the desert and up in the ocean

841
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,740
and the horizon and it's still the entire sky in the universe, that's fine.

842
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,840
That's OK. Let it go.

843
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,720
It could also be just looking at a screen like you were saying,

844
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,920
like looking at a computer screen.

845
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,720
And now I've just zoomed out, but it's still on the same screen.

846
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,440
But I've got sure.

847
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,100
But some people, it stays on that scale.

848
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,140
Other people, it can overwhelm them.

849
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,820
OK, because they're actually literally taken somewhere else.

850
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,180
Like they feel like they've been taken out into an infinitely large space.

851
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,340
And now the thing is becoming infinitely large.

852
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,320
That's OK, too.

853
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Just let it because it'll stop growing once it stops growing and goes static.

854
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,380
Now that it stopped growing and it's static, you just take a few breaths.

855
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,920
And is it static?

856
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
And if the answer is yes, it stopped growing.

857
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,380
It doesn't matter how big it is,

858
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,860
even if it filled the entire universe from horizon to horizon.

859
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,980
For some people, it has.

860
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,940
Once it goes static and you're sure it's static, it's not getting any bigger.

861
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,120
Yes, not getting any bigger.

862
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,560
Now tell it to get smaller.

863
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,600
And keep telling it to get smaller and just sit back.

864
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,380
So what is it doing? It's getting smaller.

865
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,100
It's getting whether it's what appeared to you on the screen

866
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,360
or whether it filled the room or it filled the entire universe.

867
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,540
Is it still getting smaller? Is it still getting smaller? Yes.

868
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,500
Is it so it could take up to a half an hour getting smaller.

869
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,860
You know what'll happen?

870
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,720
It'll get so small that it will disappear and it's out of your life.

871
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,260
It doesn't matter if it's the most extreme trauma.

872
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,900
You just wait for it.

873
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,480
And you can't do this on yourself because we have a survival.

874
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,680
John May says there's a survival mechanism built in that.

875
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,540
It always helps for someone to guide you through it, which makes sense.

876
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,320
By the way, there's another whole other level to having someone else there.

877
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,140
But unlike modern psychology.

878
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,500
Where they want you to express almost, by the way, modern psychology is a joke.

879
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,080
It's almost like the confessionals, the priests do.

880
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,700
You know what? They can eat a dick.

881
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,160
They can eat a bag full of dicks.

882
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,920
Those guys, the priests and the psychologists and psychiatrists.

883
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,960
So here's the thing.

884
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,000
Once it gets so small.

885
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,340
It will keep getting small until it goes into nothingness.

886
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,600
And it doesn't matter what level of trauma you have.

887
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,380
I'm talking about extreme trauma.

888
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,840
It will be out of your life. Why?

889
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,000
Because you've dealt with the image, which is the only thing the mind can store.

890
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,860
And how did you deal with it?

891
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,600
You let it take over.

892
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,920
And now it disappeared.

893
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,460
And once it disappears, it's gone.

894
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,520
It no longer has an effect on you.

895
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,780
And it works.

896
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,600
And you might have to repeat it if there's residue.

897
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,440
But it's so simple just by simply using the reductionist

898
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,020
idea that we only remember still images.

899
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
And how do you deal with it?

900
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,920
Now, there are other people that might suggest,

901
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,820
well, why don't you just tear it up and burn it in your mind?

902
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,620
It doesn't work because now you're making other excuses.

903
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,760
That's not how the brain works.

904
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,680
The brain works by taking something that's really small and expanding it

905
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,800
or contracting it, making it go away.

906
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,280
What if it happens really fast?

907
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,980
Like, you know, when you the rate of the rate of what? Fast what?

908
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,920
Well, when you said, you know, now tell it to get smaller

909
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,740
before you even got to the point of explaining that it would disappear.

910
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,600
I had already disappeared that it was that's fine.

911
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,340
The rate of of shrinkage, the rate of shrinkage doesn't matter.

912
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,980
OK, if it if it goes real fast or if it takes an hour, it doesn't matter.

913
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,880
As long as it will.

914
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,420
Now, what happens is when that image is stored in the mind,

915
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,680
even if you don't know it, your body starts to compensate

916
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,160
and build your character around it because it's bothering.

917
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,400
It knows it's there, even if it's unconscious.

918
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,600
That's why a lot of people like, why are they so messed up?

919
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,520
Oh, well, they were raped as a child. Oh, yeah.

920
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,780
And everybody accepts it. No, no, don't accept it's done.

921
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,960
You're over. You're here. You've healed. You're recovered.

922
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,640
I get rid of the thing that is affecting you.

923
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,780
So in other words.

924
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,100
It's the not dealing with this image.

925
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,680
Let's say this is one way to do it.

926
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,100
The John Mace method.

927
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,300
That image, even though you don't acknowledge it anymore,

928
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,880
it still has an effect because your mind knows it's there.

929
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,760
The part that you don't really use consciously, it's in the core.

930
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,040
You're actually destroying it at the core, really, is another way to do it.

931
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,720
The main you know, you're deleting it out of the main part of the system,

932
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,080
off the hard drive completely and making it unrecoverable.

933
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,400
And it's that simple.

934
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,040
Yes, it's that simple, just like the email work.

935
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm still getting emails on people that are practicing the email with success.

936
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,560
And I have one recent email from someone that I've known for a while says,

937
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,040
finally, you're able to turn off the street light, make it go off,

938
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,560
you know, and it took about a year and that's fine.

939
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,020
So this might also take repeated times, usually two times for some people.

940
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,980
But it's that simple.

941
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,700
And it's that simple to take interest in anything.

942
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,500
It's just a series of images.

943
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,340
And just like imagine someone who's had trauma all their life,

944
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,240
that's really bothered. I'm talking about severe trauma.

945
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,300
Well, you could guess I don't need to get graphic about it.

946
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,140
And having it disappear in one session or two sessions,

947
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,040
that's a really, really powerful tool.

948
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,560
And one of the things that I do like to bring up and I do pride

949
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,940
Greek speak being about is bringing up stuff that's very pertinent,

950
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,580
that anyone can access and is very powerful consistently.

951
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,680
And I think that's one of the marks of.

952
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,420
Greek speak.
