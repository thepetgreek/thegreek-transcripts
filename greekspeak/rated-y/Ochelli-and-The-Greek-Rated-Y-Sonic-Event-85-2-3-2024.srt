1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,200
85 is the number of the sonic and here we are, how are you doing, Greg?

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,100
Oh, we're doing okay, so are we still unculting humanity?

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,820
Yeah, you know, that is the graphic and if you go to the SoundCloud you'll see that it's used as the graphic for the playlist, the Rated Y playlist,

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,780
but it's something that you passed along to me, I don't know exactly how you constructed that,

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,080
but it was an interesting little, you know, stylish kind of looking graphic to me anyway.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,180
Quick and cheap and dirty, I don't like sitting in front of a computer for stuff like that,

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,880
and I usually don't like what graphic artists do.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,600
I'll give you a quick example.

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,360
Well, I was peddling, I was trafficking high-end spring water that I was transmuting tap water from LA,

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,100
selling it for $10 a bottle, Spring 2.0, and we had some really high-end clients, it was going well,

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,760
but the minute I come back to Tucson it falls apart because whatever, it's all stuff I do is kind of like that, walk away.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,180
Other people can't carry it, it's fine, and I deliberately, with a very fancy bottle labeling system,

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,400
insulated bag, no light, keeps it cool, really high-end.

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,340
Anyway, the design on the logo of Spring 2.0 I did myself,

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,820
basically it was Spring 2.0 Synthesized Spring Water Elite Reserve,

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,040
and I deliberately picked a late 19th century French font, the one that was typically used like,

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,460
if you go back to the late 19th century, late 1800s for those,

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,840
and you look at even a pack of cigarettes in France or soap,

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,620
they use this really elaborate, almost baroque style font, it's called French Gothic or something.

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,720
Ornate lettering implies certain things.

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, but not calligraphy though, it's not calligraphy.

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,660
Not calligraphy, I got you, but ornate lettering, what I'm saying is that intricate lettering often implies certain things.

23
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,780
Right, so a lot of graphic designers would come to me and say,

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,460
oh, I like your water, you've got great water, let's do a barter, I'm a graphic designer, and I'll design your label.

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay, so you are a graphic designer up to what everything's going on in the graphic design world,

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,280
so you're basically going to take the label and redesign it so it's real trendy,

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,140
so I have to redesign it for a few more years, and no thanks, you can keep your services.

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,920
Fine.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:31,460
That's why I went deliberately and used an 1800s font, because it's been out of style for 150 years,

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,300
it ain't going out of style any more than it is, and guess what, it's so out of style, it looks good, right?

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:37,920
Right.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:45,660
So if you're out of style, you're out of style, but if you're so far out of style, you're almost ahead of the game again, right?

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Well, much like people that use gold lettering to put on a label for anything that they want to represent as higher end,

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,460
it automatically projects…

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah, gold standard.

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,880
Yeah, gold standard.

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,120
It automatically projects a whole bunch of ideas just in that, and it could be just shiny gold colored foil.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,860
It's not gold.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
It's all like that.

40
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll give you an example.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,680
You know, with sommeliers, wine tasters, on a double blind test, every time, every one,

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,440
every sommelier wine taster prefers a $20 bottle of wine over a $100 bottle of wine,

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,740
but when you take the blindfolds off, and they know they're drinking the $100 bottle of wine and the $20 bottle of wine,

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,820
they're always going to give you reasons why they like the $100 bottle of wine better.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,100
The moment you do blindfolds, every time they pick the $20 bottle of wine.

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,380
What does that tell you?

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,380
It tells me that there's a lot of psychology built into what they think is their taste.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,700
Yeah.

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,420
Exactly.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,520
And that's funny.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,460
You know what it reminds me of is the old commercial.

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,380
Hey, hey, dummy, did you know that in this high end restaurant you were drinking Folgers?

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,380
You know, like that was Folgers coffee big thing, right?

54
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:58,640
We replaced their super expensive high end coffee with Folgers dry roasted, you know, the stuff you can buy in your kitchen.

55
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,460
This has come up a lot, Liz, in big up restaurants,

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,420
and I think by now people that are sensitive about food are not eating out as much because it's getting really crappy universally.

57
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,080
Well, it's crappy and way the hell overpriced for what you get.

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,340
Yeah.

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,140
I mean, I'm reminiscing.

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,840
$18 for a hamburger now, right?

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,120
Right.

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,300
I mean, I'm reminiscing about food, right?

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,260
And thinking back to the days when I could, you know, take a girl out to sit down at a cheap diner in Jersey.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
And, yeah, I had $20, $25 in my pocket.

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,020
I was likely to cover everything, maybe even the tip, you know, without a problem.

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,040
$20 for two people at a diner was reasonable.

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeah, you better walk there with $100 now.

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:44,040
But anyway, this has been coming up a lot about status, and I've been – I could go hang out in the ghetto, any ghetto, and people think I'm from the ghetto.

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:55,480
I could go hang out with very, very high social – I'm saying this humbly – the high social elite, which most people have never had the privilege of doing because it's considered a privilege, and they would think I'm part of them.

71
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:04,060
So what I'm saying is if you go to these restaurants – OK, in New York, you have a lot of waiters with attitude because they're like bitter actors.

72
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,560
They can't get an acting job, so they're waiting on tables, and they're really sad about it or pissed off about it.

73
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,540
They take it out on the customers, like it or not.

74
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,940
It just comes through.

75
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,740
In Tucson, it's different or in smaller places where there isn't a big acting community.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,880
If you go to a restaurant that's known to be prestigious, they kind of act real snooty because they're like, oh, you're here because we're prestigious.

77
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,700
Now you've got to put up with my attitude, right?

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,500
So whenever I sense that, like I'd be with my wife or other people.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,760
I'd say, you know, I'm going to break this waiter.

80
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,360
Look at this guy.

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,640
He's got an attitude because he thinks he's better than other restaurants, so he can afford – all right, so watch this.

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm going to break him, and this works every time.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Very few people know this.

84
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm very surprised about this.

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,920
Well, like I said, it's a privilege to be in the upper tiers of society and going to the private clubs and all that other stuff.

86
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,520
I swear I picked up what language they used.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,880
By the way, no one I've ever said this to – well, anyway.

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,440
So basically I'm going to break him.

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,060
So OK, so this is how you get these snooty waiters.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,860
What happens when you get to the – they come at the end of the meal.

91
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,040
Anything else, you say no.

92
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,800
I would like to have what?

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,860
The check.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,440
Right.

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,900
That's what everybody says.

96
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:27,140
But when you're in the higher elite circles and the host arrives to the guest of honor or the guest of the party, he asks, I am ready for the service debt.

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,560
So in the higher elite circles, they don't call it give me the check.

98
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,140
They call it I'm ready for the service debt, right?

99
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,080
So when the waiter comes, they go, I'm ready for the service debt.

100
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,300
And they're kind of like, what?

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,340
So he has to put the words together.

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,220
Service.

103
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,900
OK, got it.

104
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,300
And debt.

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720
Oh, I guess he means the check.

106
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,860
Like where the fuck did this guy come from?

107
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,920
And suddenly he feels like a hamster running around to go get the check.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
He's like, oh my gosh.

109
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,340
Because no one's ever – it's funny.

110
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,460
So anyway, things are said differently and different.

111
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,940
And they keep it to themselves.

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,740
You know how I know they keep it to themselves?

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,360
There are no films that show what I just said.

114
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,500
Not a one.

115
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,820
How many films have high snooty dinners going on and not a one ever uses that lamp?

116
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,220
Because it's reserved.

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
You either know it or you don't.

118
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,860
And it's not broadcasted.

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,660
It's not displayed.

120
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,500
It's not advertised.

121
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,960
The elite do that kind of stuff.

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
They have a certain language.

123
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,480
You know what?

124
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
I don't think I've been around the super, super elite people before.

125
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,620
But I've been around a different layer of society where there's nothing said.

126
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,460
And it's just an exchange where they know who to direct it at pretty much and it's just that's it.

127
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,020
There's nothing said in certain circles where it's just a matter of who.

128
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,820
And there's like a back and forth where there's –

129
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,840
But this is – what I'm saying though, the part about asking for the service that is quite common, by the way,

130
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,720
in the finer establishments with the finer customers.

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,560
Because there is such a thing as a finer customer.

132
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,400
I've been delving into a little bit of Seth Godin lately.

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,640
He's – the total collective stuff.

134
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,760
He's like a marketing guy.

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,880
Some other marketing guys.

136
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,940
Everyone thinks they don't really – I mean they're playing along, right?

137
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,400
Like climate change and COVID.

138
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,820
They play along with all that stuff.

139
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,440
See what kind of game – what they're trafficking in, right?

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,980
And basically the whole thing – these idiots like – all right.

141
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,740
Seth Godin, he sounds really good.

142
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,660
But is he an idiot?

143
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,200
Yeah, he's definitely in the idiot category or he's playing along like all the other ones.

144
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm talking about the high – what's the other one not to mention?

145
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,159
Names is another one.

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,340
I think Gordon something.

147
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,799
It's very popular.

148
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,660
He wears like crazy outrageous looking ties, marketing guys, self-help guru type for marketing.

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
They're morons.

150
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,640
No, they're not morons.

151
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,160
They're idiots.

152
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,500
Meaning an idiot means you're self-centered and they get whispered in their ear the agenda and they go for it and they fool the public.

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,360
And they're useful.

154
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,820
That's the other thing about idiots.

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,720
Idiots are useful.

156
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,380
Morons are just morons.

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,080
They're just morons.

158
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah, they're not very useful.

159
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,480
They're cannon fodder.

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,640
Yeah, you use them for plugging up holes and stuff.

161
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,700
So the – or shooting them out of a cannon.

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,660
That's what cannon fodder is.

163
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,860
So I'm listening to these guys and it's like I see what they're doing, whatever.

164
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:25,980
But they do have some tips because remember they're – when the collective likes what they're saying and buys their books and takes their seminars and their master class and all that other stuff,

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,500
that's what the collective is reflecting on and I'm not part of it.

166
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,900
I don't know what the collective is doing.

167
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,840
So if you're going to see what the collective is interested in – and I'm not interested in dealing with the collective.

168
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,800
But it's interesting to see this is the higher tier reflection of what they're putting on.

169
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,520
It's so loaded with agenda or whatever and he doesn't see.

170
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,040
These marketing guys don't see.

171
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,220
What they're telling you by the way is the old advertising system of TV, like for example, Tide detergent.

172
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,380
Their whole business was built on TV ads.

173
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,320
But they spend $100 million a year on internet ads and no one clicks on it.

174
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,940
No one clicks on Tide ads on the internet.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,460
No one.

176
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,400
They're wondering why because it's a TV culture thing.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,580
So what these guys are telling you now, these newer guru idiots, that you have to focus on small.

178
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,440
By the way, there is no giant market on the internet.

179
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,620
It's accumulation of millions of little markets.

180
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:34,100
Which by the way, if you apply the yin and yang, if the internet is so yin because it's so wide, you can only have yang sustain it, which is little tiny thorns.

181
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,800
Or if you look closely at your skin, you have the little peach fuzz growing, pointy objects off of a large, wide canvas.

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
So if you understand yin and yang, you see what's coming.

183
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,900
But get to the point, Greek.

184
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,280
What these idiots don't understand, the questioning, like the old marketing doesn't work anymore.

185
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,500
The hustle and the hard sell doesn't work.

186
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,480
People don't go for it.

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,540
On the internet, people are not clicking.

188
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,580
The lower end, they call it race to the bottom.

189
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,460
The people who try to offer better prices, you're racing to the bottom for coupons and stuff, not those.

190
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,100
But he's trying to explain to people the way that marketing is done doesn't work.

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,700
But they do not know that we're entering an era of techno feudalism, that these guys are talking rich and no one's going to get rich.

192
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,800
What's going to be happening is the internet is dividing people more and more, and it makes it even easier to divide them.

193
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,840
The TV divided people Republican, Democrat.

194
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
But the internet can divide people.

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,020
It's not going to divide Republican, Democrat.

196
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,600
It's going to divide all the little splinter groups that are calling the Republicans and Democrats bullshit.

197
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,360
It's going to divide all those other groups, which TV can't do.

198
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,460
Right, which has done quite well because all those splinter groups in the past would have simply walked away.

199
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,140
Okay, so we're not TV watchers.

200
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,580
It would have more effect, yeah.

201
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,820
Like how many people did you encounter media-wise, whether it was Revolution Radio or whatever?

202
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,160
They always made it a badge of honor.

203
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,380
In fact, I don't even have a TV.

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,960
Okay, great.

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,660
But it doesn't matter if you did.

206
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,340
It doesn't matter.

207
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,460
Actually, you want to watch it because you want to watch how it's going to become irrelevant.

208
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,080
It is.

209
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,380
Look at Netflix.

210
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,380
People think Netflix is an alternative.

211
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,120
It's not.

212
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,200
It's not.

213
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,560
It's created by Hollywood.

214
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,360
It's a formula.

215
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,340
They understand that you're going into techno-feudalism.

216
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Okay, take the techno part out.

217
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,680
What is feudalism?

218
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,820
I'm not going to get into it on the Sonic.

219
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,700
That's what you're going into, but it's going to be a techno-assist, the techno-feudalism.

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Yanis Varoufakis talks a lot about this.

221
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,600
He's the former finance minister of Greece.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I might be doing something with him, by the way, informally.

223
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,700
I didn't really say that, did I?

224
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,160
No.

225
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,260
In the future.

226
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,140
So yeah, look him up.

227
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Yanis Varoufakis.

228
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,500
So anyway, the techno-feudalism is coming.

229
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,580
The Middle East posture is coming as they're going to be the bad guys again.

230
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,100
And speaking of the bad guys, there was a couple of requests as you – as I've gotten

231
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,400
and on the chat as you've gotten about getting into the biblical stuff again.

232
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
I will.

233
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,400
I will.

234
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:08,860
I will.

235
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,980
Probably not today or tomorrow, but very soon.

236
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,940
I'm rehashing it based on a lot of the stuff that Jason Breshears has brought up

237
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,080
with the chronology, based on other things that I'm looking at in terms of source document

238
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,080
and basically on the chronology because the whole thing is around the chronology of the

239
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,260
Christ, right?

240
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,960
So you got to understand that as a center point.

241
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,620
Now I'm trying to see maybe it's not a center point, but it has procession.

242
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,360
And I have talked about processions before, which is like, for example, time ended in

243
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,520
1998 and then you have a five-year buffer zone, right?

244
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,620
A procession is like a swing off center, right?

245
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,700
So we're looking at that stuff.

246
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,960
But the thing is, here's the thing that I'm proud of about the biblical stuff is

247
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,060
you may not get spot on like month, day, year until it gets further down the line.

248
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,300
But I have been pretty close over the two decades talking about it.

249
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
Very, very close, right?

250
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,220
You ever hear the, again, saying Revolution Radio or whatever.

251
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,520
If I put Revolution Radio on right now, I'd have to take a shower, by the way, clean myself

252
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,880
off.

253
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,100
But anyway, I don't even think it's around anymore.

254
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,380
But that's how I feel about any of these patriot pro-America stuff.

255
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,540
Not because pro-America.

256
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm a patriot too.

257
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,760
I was born here.

258
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,940
I like the trees, the rivers, the landscape.

259
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,880
It's about it.

260
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,700
But anyway, what you look at, I almost derailed my own thought there.

261
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,340
I think I did.

262
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,520
But the whole landscape of what was coming, remember like on radio like that, they'd say,

263
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,400
oh, the world's going to end on September 23rd, 2017, right?

264
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, all different doomsday things were coming up.

265
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, at one point it was 2012.

266
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,780
That was a big, you know, time calendar.

267
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,380
Oh, yeah, which was off because it was on a 360 day, not 365.

268
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,980
It was 713 B.C.

269
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,480
Right.

270
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,640
And this is very well recorded and known by, you know, by many.

271
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,280
The Day the Earth Stood Still is a famous way to think of it.

272
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Not the movie, but, you know, the way it was described.

273
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,040
Sure.

274
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,880
And Mars came into view, by the way, and people were able to see the moons of Mars, which,

275
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,460
right, anyway.

276
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,140
What I've always said is there's a period that's going to go on like this and you're

277
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,820
for two decades and it's been spot on, just like, I think, about less than a year ago.

278
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,940
I said there's going to be a war for the end of the year.

279
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,980
Well, I think near the end of the year is, you know, in springtime, but in the fall,

280
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,560
usually, and a breakdown period to break down Israel.

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,760
Israel is going to be like the gang that couldn't shoot straight.

282
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,260
It's going to be very unfavorable.

283
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:48,840
Right.

284
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,740
But the thing where I wasn't as accurate was it appeared that it would be more an attack

285
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,820
on the West Bank North, but it ended up being a big attack on what they call Gaza.

286
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,240
Right.

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Yeah.

288
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,700
But it's certainly spreading around and world sentiment.

289
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,800
I know you don't pay attention to the news, but world sentiment is beginning to turn weirdly

290
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,860
against it, which is interesting because that's never happened before.

291
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,300
Everything's going to be good.

292
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,900
And the Palestinians are going to prevail in this politically and all the support is going

293
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,980
to go to Palestine, even American support to a degree.

294
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,060
But there's still be American support because of the Zionist movement.

295
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,440
But here here's the other thing.

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,300
One thing to watch out for.

297
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,860
It's going to cost the next prime minister, maybe even this one, his life, this whole

298
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,360
conflict.

299
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,200
Right.

300
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,760
So I'm able to come up with specifics that work well.

301
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,440
But throw in the chronology of Jason Breshears, which I've been looking at it to look at

302
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,360
a little closer and his description of the seals and stuff.

303
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,760
I got to integrate with that what I'm doing, because it's not like I'm wrong and he's

304
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,400
right or she's wrong and he's right.

305
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
It's we're all here to learn.

306
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,160
We're all here to compile what's going on, because like it or not, we're all on the

307
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,920
same cruise ship.

308
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,160
Right.

309
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,800
So but you stay in your cabin away from my cabin.

310
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,200
Right.

311
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,200
But we're still on the same ship.

312
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,600
Right.

313
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:02,880
Sure.

314
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:03,720
So.

315
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,460
Yeah.

316
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,900
So that's that's where I'm at with the biblical stuff.

317
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,920
And I might even go into some older notes that I've had for decades and look at it and

318
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,960
see if I could purvey like how my thinking has changed over the decades.

319
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,220
Right.

320
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,440
Because I started this in around 2003, the biblical look before before 2003.

321
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,839
If you brought up the Bible, I said, come on, what are you joking?

322
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,880
That was written by Shakespeare.

323
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
See, I'd never read it.

324
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,580
I just heard references.

325
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,460
I knew it wasn't valid document, but I knew that everyone used it as a basis.

326
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,960
But when I started and I wanted to read it because I wanted to find out what's in it.

327
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,500
And when I started reading it, no one was talking about anything that was in there

328
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,360
making stuff up.

329
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,040
And I'm saying, OK, my crazy is the world crazy.

330
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,520
Right.

331
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,300
Well, it's odd because not not because people aren't following the book.

332
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,700
I mean, that's normal in anything, but they don't even know what's in it.

333
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,480
But yeah, the odd thing is, though, that it's supposed to be the centerpiece.

334
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:56,740
Right.

335
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,060
It is the guide.

336
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,380
If you ask the devoted Christian out there, the publicly, you know, pronouncing I'm an

337
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,440
absolute whatever they go, all I need to know is in the Bible.

338
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,060
Great.

339
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,720
OK, cool.

340
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah.

341
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,500
But if you show them what they're saying is not in the Bible, then they say they don't

342
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,160
need it.

343
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,420
Yeah.

344
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,380
Especially if, you know, they've got the Bible belt.

345
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:15,600
Right.

346
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,400
You're talking like the Bible belt is the easiest place to find those.

347
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,320
And then you've got the buckle of the Bible belt, which is even worse.

348
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:21,740
Yes.

349
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,460
So they'll kill you.

350
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,160
They don't even know what what they're saying is not in it.

351
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Maybe some off, you know, off.

352
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,740
I would say out of context quotes is the best you're going to get.

353
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,140
Yeah.

354
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,980
The guys who play with snakes actually know more of what's in the book than most of the

355
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,340
other ones.

356
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,820
I'd say.

357
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,200
Yeah.

358
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,440
Well, the ones who will have the best chance of knowing what's in the Bible are Satanists

359
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,260
and atheists.

360
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:42,780
Yeah.

361
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,220
Because they have the only ones right now that have a rational approach because they've already

362
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,780
rejected the the programming of the religions.

363
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,220
Right.

364
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,680
So the Satanists and the atheists, they have a better chance, believe it or not, folks,

365
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,900
of finding out cognitively, like reading the Bible and actually getting it than any religious

366
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,340
person.

367
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,180
Easy by far.

368
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
It's easy to say that.

369
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,880
So, yeah, it's like someone who learns how to cook the wrong way or terrible food.

370
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,700
You're not going to get them to make delicious food where someone who doesn't know how to

371
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,860
cook at all and doesn't like to cook.

372
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,480
If they once decide that they want to now get into cooking, they will have a much better

373
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,840
chance of making delicious food than those who learned not to make delicious food.

374
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,040
Right.

375
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,080
Because they already got the bad habits set.

376
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,860
All true.

377
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,960
But let's let's rope it in and tighten the rope.

378
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,900
OK, because here's the thing.

379
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,920
When we when we talked about this previously and we talked about uncultivated, we started

380
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,980
on maybe describing what the cult is.

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,920
And also we talked about why we were going to call this rated Y.

382
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,520
And these things are important now, not because, you know, it's not an ego thing here.

383
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,260
It's a matter of what is the point of uncultivated?

384
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,480
Why is you know, don't the cults serve a purpose, too?

385
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,580
I mean, everything you are.

386
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,140
Well, the cult.

387
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,200
OK, it's very simple.

388
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,000
It's very simple.

389
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,820
You know, this is like people say that spiritual everything.

390
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,220
I mean, if you're asleep or knocked out or in a coma or dead, then you're non-spiritual.

391
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,820
But anyone who has is awake and conscious, even whatever level of intelligence or cognition

392
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,200
that's everything that you do and think about has a spiritual connotation to it.

393
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,460
Right.

394
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
Spirit is consciousness.

395
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,780
So the cult is short for culture.

396
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,940
I had someone once tell me, don't use that word called because it's it's it means

397
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,760
CUNT.

398
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,740
And I'm like, no, it doesn't.

399
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,380
What's wrong with you?

400
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,680
Where the hell did you get that from?

401
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,060
Yeah.

402
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,120
Just moronic.

403
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,300
You'll hear everything except for what it is.

404
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,160
I believe it's short for culture.

405
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,580
Yeah.

406
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,800
That's why it's that's why it's called a cult.

407
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,440
Sure.

408
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:39,820
Right.

409
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,080
Cult.

410
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,360
So.

411
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,940
So basically you have everyone is in a cult as you know, as the as it's becoming more

412
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,100
world based now, the culture is evening out.

413
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,400
Right.

414
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,280
Unless the people that are out of touch, you know, are not being affected.

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,960
But you have microculture, macroculture than the world culture.

416
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,400
And now they'll point a finger at a group that is outside of that culture as a cult.

417
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,100
You see.

418
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,120
Right.

419
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,340
You know how they always blow, whatever, call others what they're doing themselves.

420
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,740
Right.

421
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,520
Right.

422
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:15,800
You know.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,880
So, you know, any government will do a false flag and they'll blame it on someone, even

424
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,860
though they're the ones that orchestrated the whole thing.

425
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,880
It's a typical thing.

426
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,100
So uncultivating means abandoning the culture.

427
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,360
For what?

428
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,800
You know, here's the thing.

429
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,520
A lot of health and status, health and stability of a society was based on their traditions.

430
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,280
And as the generations pass, if you convince the more nation part of the society, the

431
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,800
more naive that these traditions are no good.

432
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,800
You just do something different for the sake of being different.

433
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,840
Now you're destroying stability in the culture.

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,380
Oh, wow.

435
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,220
Sounds like the 60s and 70s.

436
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,440
Right.

437
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,340
Well, yes.

438
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,720
Yes.

439
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,020
No.

440
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,060
Because here's the thing.

441
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,360
Right.

442
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,940
To simply be in opposition to the culture is not sufficient enough to affect any sort of

443
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,200
change.

444
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,980
To be.

445
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,960
And that's the other thing.

446
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
It becomes a culture in and of itself.

447
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,660
Right.

448
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,260
The the anti-culture, the, you know, the anti-establishment they used to say during those 60s and 70s

449
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,520
times.

450
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,800
Right.

451
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,560
OK.

452
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,140
Great.

453
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,520
Fine.

454
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,660
You're anti-establishment.

455
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
Well, what does that mean?

456
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,280
But hold on.

457
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,260
But uncultivating is more this definition would mean to go back to traditions that benefit

458
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,480
social stability.

459
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm not I don't mean like in communism, which is never the works.

460
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,760
Anything that Marx and Engel wrote was never been put into practice, by the way.

461
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,000
Right.

462
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,340
Yeah.

463
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,660
But it's not merely traditional.

464
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,080
You see, culture is not merely tradition because culture is about.

465
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,560
Well, actually, it's based on.

466
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,800
No, I disagree.

467
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,700
In a way.

468
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

469
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,620
But in a way.

470
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:43,840
No.

471
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,840
Because here's the thing.

472
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,080
Right.

473
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,020
You know, culture is also based on your actions.

474
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,540
What language you speak is not necessarily based on tradition.

475
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,680
It's based on what is functional.

476
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,440
Is that right?

477
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,800
But what I mean by tradition is stuff that promotes well-being overall.

478
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,860
Right.

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,880
In other words, here's a very simple way.

480
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,420
And this is what I think about it all the time.

481
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,140
Living in harmony with nature, a very simple thing that I've always brought up is eating

482
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,500
seasonally what's local.

483
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,080
Right.

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,100
You're not going to get sick if you do that.

485
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,600
It's impossible to get sick.

486
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,820
If you have good hygiene and I've always got I've always have you uncalled stress, good

487
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,300
hygiene.

488
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,240
Right.

489
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,640
And believe it or not, most people think, you know, good hygiene is so they they you

490
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,380
know, they don't.

491
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,820
Yes.

492
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,960
It's part of it, like part of a complete breakfast.

493
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,280
Right.

494
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,140
But good hygiene.

495
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,020
Keep your underarms and your groin clean.

496
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,040
Keep your hands clean under your fingernails clean and then eat what's local.

497
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,260
And in season, if you have running water and running sewage where the sewage is away from

498
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,800
where you eat, sleep and live, there is no way you'll get sick.

499
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,600
There's no way.

500
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,640
Very rare.

501
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,800
And you will thrive.

502
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,440
You won't have dental problems, skin problems.

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,100
Right.

504
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,260
People will, you know, you will thrive.

505
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,280
So that is the simple culture tradition to keep.

506
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,780
And by the way, what I just mentioned was true because people didn't have transcontinental

507
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,360
railways to move things around.

508
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,640
They ate and used what they had.

509
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,300
It's just that people develop from poverty mindset, poor hygiene, and that led to other

510
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,360
things and poor water management.

511
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,640
Another thing that goes along with the hygiene, by the way, is keeping your hair in order.

512
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,360
Believe it or not, your your body hair, your hair on your head or you.

513
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,160
Yeah.

514
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,540
Of course.

515
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,820
And by the way, if if you're if someone I did this recently because I got the circus

516
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,760
look that people don't ask me what the circus flew.

517
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,200
It's a story that I gave a few episodes ago.

518
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,280
Look up Wendy Blades.

519
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
That's my sister's daughter.

520
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,860
My niece.

521
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
She visited me here.

522
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,760
She lived in a tent with four porta potties and 40 people from Mexico and some from Italy.

523
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,000
And they were breeding some kind of thing.

524
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,120
You just can't help it.

525
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,520
Yes.

526
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:49,720
Right.

527
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
Or they're in a traveling circus.

528
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,760
And I met her.

529
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,800
Give her a big hug and a kiss.

530
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,600
And here I go for three weeks.

531
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,660
I feel like a dog that's ready to be put down.

532
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,480
By the way, if you have something that you can't kick like that's frequency to you call

533
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,960
it bugs.

534
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,420
It's fine.

535
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,700
But if you have like an ailment, whatever it might be that you can't kick, go ahead

536
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,120
and start cutting your nails to the quick shave your head, cut your fur, cut off the

537
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,680
fur, cut the fur off your body, keep your paws clean.

538
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,320
Right.

539
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,560
Right.

540
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,380
And you'll heal up much faster.

541
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,040
Yeah.

542
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,560
By the way, that was typical practice in old nursing handbooks when someone would come

543
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,140
in very specific about trimming their fingernails and cutting their hair off, you know, and

544
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,480
cleaning them up because it harbors, like you said, hair and other things can harbor

545
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,860
the frequency of what is making you ill.

546
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,880
So this is the first time I've been this ill in my entire life.

547
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,920
Other than the standard flu stuff that you get when you're a child, you know, right.

548
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,680
Because your body, again, is changing in the frequency, right?

549
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,200
It's all frequency based frequency, not like frequency radio, but the biological vacuum

550
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,280
associations.

551
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,660
It's transitional stress, really, because when when the body is changing, when the environment

552
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,620
is changing, these things put stress.

553
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,820
Right here.

554
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,420
Let me say something I've said before.

555
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,500
This is not a tangent with illness.

556
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,900
The reason you get ill or anyone gets ill from you want to believe in microbes or whatever

557
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,980
when you're affected and you and you induced some kind of illness, you know, if you have

558
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,980
something that really puts you down, makes you really feel what they call sick.

559
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,860
The reason why you feel that way, you're ready for this.

560
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,500
I've never gotten into this before, and I've been pondering this for a long time.

561
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,300
I just haven't found anything definitive to back it up.

562
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,560
So this is like the Greeks opinion is because the illness itself on a frequency level is

563
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,660
trying to change your DNA.

564
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,780
Oh, wow.

565
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,360
Now, if I said this a long time ago, it would sound really esoteric.

566
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,500
But what happened in twenty twenty or twenty twenty two when they were rejecting everyone

567
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,080
with what?

568
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,420
And then RNA injections.

569
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,760
Right.

570
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,980
And when I saw that, I was like, OK, I better start talking about this because that's what

571
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:08,380
makes you really, really sick is when something goes after the code in your body or it starts

572
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,100
changing it.

573
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,700
Right.

574
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,140
Right.

575
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,620
It's attempting to change that.

576
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,380
It's not microbes in your bloodstream.

577
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,780
There's a lot of stuff about that where you could have certain pathogens show up in your

578
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,480
blood, but they show up in your blood.

579
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,060
They didn't come from the outside.

580
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,200
They've done many experiments, especially in war camps where people would have these

581
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,380
horrific diseases.

582
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,020
Certain microbes did show up in their blood and they would inject healthy people with

583
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,700
it and they wouldn't come down with the disease.

584
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,860
So they were wondering it can't be the microbe.

585
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,040
Right.

586
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,800
So but anyway, I just wanted to put that out and I can get into it more because there's

587
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,820
no basis for for this that I found other than thought experiments.

588
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,140
Right.

589
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,360
Why would you feel so ill if it's just something your body can eliminate?

590
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,260
Because that something is trying to change you into something else.

591
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,180
Right.

592
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:03,100
It's kind of like remember like the old horror thriller movies when the wolf turns into the

593
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,520
wolf man.

594
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,240
It's pretty painful.

595
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,160
Yeah.

596
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,520
Right.

597
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,360
Right.

598
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,280
Or when Dr. Jekyll goes to Mr. Hyde, it's pretty painful.

599
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,260
Right.

600
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,540
Right.

601
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
So it's actually a form.

602
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
So anyway, it was not a tangent.

603
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,760
We're talking about the culture and changing it.

604
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,960
All you have to do is go and find out how people lived at one point, where you're living

605
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,420
now.

606
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,360
Right.

607
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,740
And you will see that the invaders, whoever came over and changed it, would not have been

608
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,820
able to stick around unless they adopted what the indigenous people were doing to some degree.

609
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,240
And they integrated that.

610
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,540
Right.

611
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,400
So when you look at, for example, those South American and Latin countries, rice and beans

612
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,300
are a popular dish.

613
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,660
Well, in America, it is a popular.

614
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,020
You know, if you go to Mexico, I mean, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, rice and beans is a popular

615
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,420
dish still here, just like because it was indigenous agriculture.

616
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,020
Right.

617
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,380
Right.

618
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,320
And so on and so forth.

619
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,500
So, yeah, going back.

620
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,040
So the uncultivating is very simple.

621
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:08,200
You know, your body when when you were conceived in the womb, if the moms did not input earth

622
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
elements, you would not be here right now.

623
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,700
You would have been starved out of her body.

624
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,880
And while you're born and growing and alive, even her mother's milk, you rely on earth

625
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,320
elements to ingest.

626
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,340
And when you die, guess what happens to your body?

627
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,560
It goes back to what earth elements, doesn't it?

628
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,700
So everything that you have here belongs to the earth.

629
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,160
That's why it's interesting in scripture.

630
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,760
You know, the wealthiest or the poorest die the same.

631
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,000
Right.

632
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,420
I like a line I saw in a film called Fury recently.

633
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,380
It's like when I die, make sure to bury me face down.

634
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,980
It's like, why?

635
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
So you go to hell faster?

636
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,160
No.

637
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,600
So the whole world kiss my ass.

638
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:46,800
Right.

639
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,720
So anyway.

640
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,640
Yeah.

641
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,960
It's one of those things that doesn't really matter.

642
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,880
That's why, you know, we get more into the mental part.

643
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,920
And by the way, let's just end this part right here on the call on the cult.

644
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,260
I just want to bring up a little recap on what we did last week on air, because I have gotten

645
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,180
some feedback that it's an LP.

646
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,860
It's not an LP at all.

647
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,400
And let me just give a little bit of a recap.

648
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,600
a little more support why it's not an LP and some of it might be from something that

649
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,620
may set also.

650
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,540
And I preface before we got into the session that I did, I think I would consider that

651
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,400
a live session that we did on on the episode 84.

652
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,960
Wouldn't you consider it a live session?

653
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,500
Yeah, sure.

654
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Sure.

655
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,280
Yeah.

656
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,740
Walking.

657
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,040
Yeah.

658
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,280
OK.

659
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,580
Anybody that listens to that, even though I was addressing you, Chuck, can go through

660
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,520
it the same way.

661
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,780
Right.

662
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,260
And there's something about it.

663
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,980
You can't really do it to yourself because we have internal survival mechanism mechanisms

664
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,880
that only allow us to go so deep.

665
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,740
But let me just preface why it's not an LP at all at all, is because the premise of this

666
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,720
working and being beneficial is very simply that we only record still images, not neuro

667
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,780
linguistic programming.

668
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,200
Right.

669
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,740
It has absolutely nothing to do with neuro linguistic probing at all.

670
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,220
Zero.

671
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,460
If you've gone the wrong way, basically the needle jumped off the record and the record

672
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,640
fell on the floor and the needles broken.

673
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,760
And if if if anyone thinks it's going that route, that'll be at all.

674
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,200
This has this has to do strictly with even if you let's say let's say it again, that

675
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,520
the mind records everything and still images.

676
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,980
Now, anyone that's been in a projector room and looks at film motion picture, what do

677
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,080
you see when you hold the reel in your hand and you open it?

678
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,460
Still picture, still picture, still picture, still picture, still picture or like a picture

679
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,680
book.

680
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:37,760
The moment you flip that picture book or start quickly moving that film over a lens, it looks

681
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,520
like it's moving.

682
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,660
Just like when you think of a past event and you think you're actually remembering it like

683
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,660
a movie and you're not, you're actually getting screenshots.

684
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,680
The motion is an illusion.

685
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,240
It is.

686
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:51,900
That's right.

687
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,300
It is all an illusion.

688
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,820
That's right.

689
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,960
And even memory of an event in motion.

690
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,580
You're actually viewing fast screenshots with big, big parts missing in between Zapruder

691
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:03,880
film.

692
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,180
Anyone.

693
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,840
So.

694
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,140
Right.

695
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,600
So it's the same thing.

696
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,060
But it still looks cohesive, but it's not.

697
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:15,980
So the whole idea, then, is what happens is when the when the body decides that this

698
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,780
is trauma, because, by the way, someone who's into S&M might welcome a certain degree of

699
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,500
trauma and not record it as such memorialize it as someone who is not into S&M.

700
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:26,740
Right.

701
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,960
You know what I mean?

702
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,480
So force feeding someone Brussels sprouts could be very traumatic where a Brussels sprouts

703
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,380
lover would be.

704
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,840
That was not traumatic at all.

705
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
So it's very subjective.

706
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,840
That's why it doesn't matter.

707
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,680
Real simple.

708
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,240
You put a dominatrix in your head with a whip in her hand.

709
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,880
Now, some people might take that as a threatening image and others might take that as something

710
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,700
to get happy about.

711
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:46,900
Yeah.

712
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,940
By the way, I once dated a psychiatrist.

713
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,260
Right.

714
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,860
And after dinner, she goes, let's go here.

715
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,100
And we went down by the meat district in Manhattan.

716
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,440
It was a black steel door, really dirty place.

717
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,260
Walked in.

718
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,220
It was an S&M club.

719
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,380
I mean, you go in each room, you could see what's going on.

720
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,600
I mean, anything you could imagine, like, you know, the two liter Coke bottles going

721
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,660
in the big end first.

722
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,720
Anyway, crazy stuff.

723
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,660
I don't know how people would survive.

724
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,980
She was into that.

725
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,640
I'm like, my gosh.

726
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,720
And you're a psychiatrist that orders medicine.

727
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
I left the cabin.

728
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:16,960
Never.

729
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,740
She left.

730
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,880
Called me back a few times.

731
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,220
Never called her back because it was just like, this is really.

732
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,520
If she wasn't a psychiatrist, I might have called her back, said, you're a sick bitch.

733
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,540
But because she was a psychiatrist, I didn't know what to.

734
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,940
I mean, like this woman needs to be reported to the authorities.

735
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Right.

736
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,080
But then you find out the authorities are the ones that go there, too.

737
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,180
Right.

738
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,640
Anyway.

739
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,300
Yeah.

740
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,660
So, man, I go into that.

741
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,540
But the still images.

742
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:49,120
So what happens is when you record memorialize one of these still images or a series of stills

743
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,500
that you consider is an event, what happens is it gets buried back there.

744
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,780
But your body deals with it by modifying your ego, modifying your character to just like

745
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,440
you develop pus or blister to protect the body.

746
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,580
The body protects you by modifying your character and creating a little sub ego around that.

747
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,440
So you always have an excuse or reason to deny it or a reason why you always want to

748
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,179
talk about it, wear it like a badge.

749
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,900
Everyone's got a different thing to how to deal with that image is because now you have

750
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,179
this thing that you consider an evader invader in your psyche and your psyche keeps

751
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,159
compensating for it.

752
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,540
So the purpose of this method, it's all emo based, by the way.

753
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,620
If you do catch up with any of the writings or whatever you get on John Mase, he says

754
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,980
it's all emo based, emotionally based.

755
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,300
So basically you're using the emo to get rid of it where that's why we get into

756
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,520
look how big it gets.

757
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,300
Let it keep growing and growing, growing.

758
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,400
Remember, it's all emotional.

759
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,179
And then when it stops, you acknowledge that it stopped getting bigger.

760
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,679
OK, it's static now.

761
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,480
Now let's order it to go the other way into infinitely small till it disappears.

762
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,900
And you're done with it and you are done.

763
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,360
N, D, O, N, E with a capital N done.

764
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,660
It's so simple.

765
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
And if it doesn't work once, you do it again.

766
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,580
So this is the whole thing.

767
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,020
It has nothing to do with neurology, has nothing to do with words or linguistics,

768
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,100
has nothing to do with programming, is a simple application of the emotional body

769
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,540
dealing with a stored image or series of images.

770
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,640
Very simple.

771
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,260
And it doesn't have to be trauma either.

772
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,780
I mean, I'll tell you this.

773
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,200
It could be an addiction.

774
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,020
It could be anything.

775
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,100
It could be absolutely anything.

776
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,820
If you come up with a feeling or something that is a general,

777
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,660
you will draw a picture that goes along with it.

778
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,740
Well, actually, this is different again.

779
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,400
No, hold on.

780
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,680
But you'll create a but you're not actually remembering the event

781
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,340
as a form of a still picture.

782
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,740
That's what's in your memory.

783
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,780
You're not actually drawing it.

784
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,780
You're actually drawing from the you're not drawing anything.

785
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,880
What you're doing is you're recording it as a still image.

786
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,340
There's no different than you would take a shot with a camera.

787
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,280
And of course, it would be what you perceive.

788
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,620
Right.

789
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,980
OK, just like a dream.

790
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,360
You know, some people, you know, like in dreams,

791
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,740
if you see if there's a conference next time you have a dream,

792
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,900
the typical things about dreams that they're black and white or whatever.

793
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
But the next time you think you're in a conversation,

794
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,020
a dream, try to focus on the mouths.

795
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,560
You'll notice the mouths never move.

796
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,140
And also, you'll never read anything in a dream.

797
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,820
You'll never read a sign.

798
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,460
You'll never read.

799
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,880
There's no reading in dreams because that's linguistic.

800
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,260
Right.

801
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,720
You see.

802
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,220
Right.

803
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,980
So these interesting things.

804
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,180
But if you're ever in a dream and there's a conversation

805
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,780
and you see mouths moving and you command yourself to see your hands

806
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,060
and you can move your hands and do something with your hands.

807
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,580
Guess what?

808
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,920
You're not you're not in a dream.

809
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,800
You're an alternate reality because dreams have been looked at

810
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,120
for thousands of years and very well defined.

811
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,160
And it's not shared with the public openly

812
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,880
because the last thing you want them to do

813
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,180
is take control of their dreams

814
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,920
and then find out when they're not in a dream

815
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,820
and take control of that.

816
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,660
My gosh, then you have people with too much control.

817
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,000
How are you going to control them?

818
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,120
I guess I was imprecise with the way I described it.

819
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,100
Here's the thing, though.

820
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,000
Any event, any emotion,

821
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,140
any general category or specific thing,

822
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,080
a book cover arrives for it,

823
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,780
basically in your mind.

824
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,660
You could say that.

825
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,540
Keep the emotions out of it.

826
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,380
The emotions are completely simple,

827
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,360
completely different artifact.

828
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,280
But if you do turn around

829
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,780
and you focus on an emotion,

830
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,320
and I say this all the time,

831
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,620
a particular emotion,

832
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,360
depending on what part of it I'm talking about,

833
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,780
like, you know,

834
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,560
you could use the word love.

835
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,580
OK, so I love certain things.

836
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,060
But hold on, hold on.

837
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm going to stop you right here

838
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,700
because it's very critical.

839
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,980
OK, so the image that you store

840
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,140
and the mental story that you give

841
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,200
is not the emotion.

842
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,220
Just very simply,

843
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,200
you can have people that like horror flicks

844
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,240
and other people that throw up if they see it.

845
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,800
Right.

846
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,220
It has nothing to do with the emo at all.

847
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,760
Really, that's the thing I've been trying to do

848
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,660
about the emo work

849
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,300
is that we're never told

850
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,920
what the purpose of emotion is.

851
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,760
It's a faculty.

852
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,540
It's not a perception.

853
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,360
It's a faculty.

854
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,560
Just a faculty would be like,

855
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
you know, using your hands

856
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,140
or using your mouth to speak

857
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,600
or something to create something.

858
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,620
The emo is very simple.

859
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,680
You actually do not store emotions.

860
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,800
You don't.

861
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
Emotion is like saying

862
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm storing my ability

863
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,000
to write with my right hand.

864
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,420
You're not.

865
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,720
You have the ability

866
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,280
and you use it when you need to.

867
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,300
The images that are stored

868
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,660
are independent on how,

869
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,520
not emotionally,

870
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,220
but how you were affected then

871
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,740
and if it was considered trauma

872
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
or not based on your culture,

873
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,340
personal preference and all that.

874
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,640
Your emotion is what you use

875
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,480
to then categorize it as trauma.

876
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,300
It doesn't come together.

877
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,900
It comes after.

878
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,920
That's why very often

879
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,200
you'll see someone experience

880
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
something very traumatic

881
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,500
and they seem OK until like

882
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,460
five seconds later

883
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,000
and then they start breaking down

884
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
and crying because they have to

885
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,760
attach the emotion to it.

886
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,360
But emotion is a faculty.

887
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,160
That's why I keep getting

888
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,080
into the emo work.

889
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,760
We're never told

890
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,880
what the purpose of emotion

891
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,040
is because it's so powerful

892
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,860
once you learn it.

893
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,480
I find that that faculty

894
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,260
attached to something though

895
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,320
becomes exactly how

896
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,000
that image is retained.

897
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,500
If you're not aware of it.

898
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,660
If you're not aware that they're

899
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,560
distinct and separate.

900
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,400
Yes, absolutely.

901
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,240
It's confusion.

902
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,920
Just like you're not aware

903
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,040
of the soul and the spirit.

904
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,980
One is the physical metabolism.

905
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,180
The other one is the mind.

906
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,140
It's very important.

907
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,500
These fine details are important.

908
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,560
Look, if you're going to do

909
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,100
really good, delicious food,

910
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,860
fine detail.
