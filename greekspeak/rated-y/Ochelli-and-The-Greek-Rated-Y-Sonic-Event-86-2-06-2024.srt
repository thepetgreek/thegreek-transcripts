1
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,700
86 best I can figure it out looks like we're at that sonic event you know the

2
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,140
first thing that comes to mind the phrase 86 you throw something away you toss it you

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,460
eliminate it are you for 86 that was the abortion pill kind of ironic a lot of things we could

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,140
tie to just the number but let's get on to the words how you doing tonight Greek sleepy

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:56,360
but doing okay I think I might have heard your neighbor's dog bark on cue there right

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,220
when I said it and it was turning to you did you hear that no I didn't know it's there's no

7
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,840
neighbor's dog anymore no kidding the ghost hitting the ghost dog in the machine so the

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,140
throwaway episode also worried speaking of throwing away a year where this is about a

9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:20,500
year also pretty close within a week okay so here we go with this the counting of time now

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,000
becomes almost irrelevant you know but nobody knows what time it is anyway and if they do they

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,120
don't know yeah yeah but it's about a year and this was actually a very slow year for me this

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,320
past year albeit time speeding up as you get older so yeah so yeah something you mentioned

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,500
someone messaged about the scalarator and possibly getting into monatomic elements I got a lot to say

14
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,220
about that okay so yeah then there was one other contact which I didn't show you but I figured

15
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,220
I'll relate it to you I'll save you time here I go saving you time and stitch in nine and all that

16
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:09,580
but 89 will be the next episode anyway either ladies 87 oh 87 87 right it'll be a couple episode

17
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,180
look at me I'm screwing up what I'm trying to say well what else is new funny thing this email

18
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,320
starts off kind of insulting me a little bit that I'm like I wonder why well cuz according to them

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm kind of like your retarded pet apparently during these Sonics that we do together which

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,740
I know I'm the pet Greek you got it I got that spot already but that's it but I'm the retarded

21
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,580
I'm the retarded one you're dragging along going look this is a pony Chucky yeah that's kind of

22
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,280
what you're doing but anyway then he gets he gets a little nicer and kind of sideways insults you a

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,100
little bit but none of that's relevant really because I just want to give you the attitude

24
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:56,400
setting that we go into here many times he says that you mentioned that everything this world is

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,600
yeah well of course we're in a simulation now putting that together biological all right let's

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,620
let's go because I get thrown off on tangency it's a biological one because if people keep

27
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,480
thinking of the matrix and these computers and things like that then then that makes us robots

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,900
and we're not robots but we are biological machines it is a biological simulation of

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,260
that is more real and all this by the way started with Plato right you know like if you think of the

30
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,360
color white although all these different whites which one is white well there's a true white

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,320
somewhere in a in a better realm right so whether you're looking at the low-grade religion is

32
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:43,760
religious promises or any form of analytics you'll see that there's no real reality here

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,640
but it is biological yeah not to discount it no not at all and look there is the matter of

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,960
containment versus you know what is entertainment literally because when you think of Plato you

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,740
obviously got to go to the projections on the cave wall and the concept of the cave and do

36
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,340
you know about anything outside of that cave do you need to know about it well no because you're

37
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,340
in the cave at the moment now when the moment comes that you're outside of that cave you might

38
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,540
want to know what's going on maybe maybe not but anyway back to the simulation and it is

39
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,780
relevant just hold on I won't go too far on this thing is if we're in a simulation and you accept

40
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,520
that the gods are real and we are real but yet we're in a simulation what's to say that this

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,420
is not a fully fleshed out parallel of what the gods would do they wouldn't bother to interact

42
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,360
with us directly they might let us be the NPCs so to speak in their own game where it's kind of

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,440
not relevant we're just part of their video game so to speak yeah I don't know what kind of

44
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,200
agreements they have behind the scenes they don't always share everything but it's there it's okay

45
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,160
they do put it out but it's not in a form that we recognize right the reasons for these things you

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,480
know the money okay they always get into the money system like there's hardly anyone that knows how

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,340
the money system works because he because it's actually accessible you know it's it's kind of

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,760
convoluted but once you you follow down the road before they got into this convoluted system with

49
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,380
the money they had to give you a remedy which is you know the law you know redeeming awful money

50
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,460
every country has something similar to that and no one uses it so the the story of the gods and

51
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,780
humans and the gods of the gods and on and on and on is all the same these remedies are put out like

52
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,100
if you really want to if you're having a hard time here you want to find out why you're having a hard

53
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,420
time I assure you the reasons are given we just don't know where they are and I'm talking just

54
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,680
literary ones so information all right go ahead yeah but overall the question boils down to this

55
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,920
isn't it more likely that the reason why this is set up is not for this nefarious oh they're seeking

56
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,480
to control us and the people are hijacking and all of that that is all secondary the reality is

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,620
that if the gods were to say communicate with us directly because several times we've gone over how

58
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,320
you're communicated to by other entities other middlemen one way or another other facilities

59
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,600
one way or another there's a middleman there's a middle part of the process etc it's because in a

60
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,180
direct fashion based on our construction our limitation we would not be able to interact

61
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,220
with them directly so everything boils down to how good your middleman is how good your instruction

62
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,400
book is how good the part of the simulation the programming is in your part of the simulation

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,660
all of it comes down to you're dealing with some sort of middleman because to be in direct contact

64
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:59,000
with the gods we would not be able to have the story typically go but if you were you then it

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,320
would be in such a different framework that it would be difficult to communicate to the others

66
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,960
and then you'd be thrown in an insane asylum and it would be just as bad right well even if you get

67
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,020
close to it that happens but in a real direct sense what what he was saying is isn't it true

68
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,500
that basically we cannot interact directly we know it interrupts a certain part of the show

69
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,700
like what I mean sure I mean like you have acts and then you have scenes within there so these

70
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,320
things have to be played out it seems mm-hmm right so yeah the overall question once again

71
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,260
is just simply isn't it just based on the fact that we are incapable of doing it though because

72
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,400
we don't have you know the old idea that why does why do angels speak to people instead of God

73
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:51,720
directly a lot of this we're completely incapable the situation doesn't permit it the situate right

74
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,160
every aspect of it yeah and you could still see even now people's lack of ability to communicate

75
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,840
clearly I mean just with you know with their mouth let's say for freedom that's what you're

76
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,380
all writing or whatever yeah and that's still like a leftover hindrance that was put on humans a long

77
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,200
time ago unless humans just started out as really dumb creatures that were genetically modified to

78
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,540
be what we consider now but that doesn't make sense of how much degradation has been taking

79
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:26,160
place over the centuries so either way either way it's fine I think next week I'll bring up I

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:36,059
found a book that was online about 1749 someone I think I had this book at one point and it was

81
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,799
about meteors anomalies and things that in the world world history and chronology I don't have

82
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,660
the title with me right now I'll put it up in the chat or in the next sonic so it's a good one it's

83
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,740
got some interesting stuff because it gets into medical remedies towards the end of the book so

84
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,660
pretty interesting no definitely I look it's all fascinating to me that's for sure but people often

85
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,360
ask about the biblical stuff and they never really have a direct question but he wanted to

86
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,100
get into more about how it's the best way to look at it is that it's always about middlemen one way

87
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,300
or another there's always gonna be it is you know so direct interaction even though people talk all

88
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,320
the time about being I was touched by God I was you know God spoke to me you know all of those and

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,660
by the way I'm using all these different phrases and things that I know are absolutely not part

90
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,780
of Greek speak at all I'm just trying to give you the most relatable bits of it to make it understood

91
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,880
and this is what he did in a very long rambling thing that would have taken me longer that's okay

92
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,580
so let's just stop it right here and we'll be able to pick it up again or just dismiss it right because

93
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,780
I get a lot of long rambling emails as well some of them are enjoyable some of them are not and

94
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:57,260
usually if you do send long emails if I if I do enjoy them I usually respond back that I enjoy

95
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:05,420
you writing to me so it's yeah it's not something that I don't enjoy and and so people who do send

96
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,620
me very long emails when I give that response well you know it's a thumbs up so yeah and I

97
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,700
particularly don't mind when some people do it like you same thing I'll call I'll call one out

98
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,620
by name you know Meg Z when she sends me something I enjoy it I always enjoy it it's even if she's

99
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,340
telling me you know things that maybe are you know outside of where I thought the conversation

100
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:34,440
was going it's always enjoyable just to I don't know read her stuff it's just enjoyable anyway I

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,000
keep using that word forget it point is if anybody else wants us to pick up on this idea about the

102
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,640
middleman and how that works or that system I think people would be interested in it but let

103
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,100
us know because if I don't hear from you I don't know what's in your heads I'm not that kind of

104
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,240
guy anyway moving forward or maybe backward depending on how you want to look at it yeah

105
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,820
I did send this thing along about the scalerator and I got to admit I'm finding it interesting as

106
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,200
sort of an observer who you know straight out I'm not going to try and build any of this or anything

107
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,860
else but watching the process and learning a great deal of things along the way just about

108
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:19,620
the nature of certain things how things are handled and how it is we've been given to understand they

109
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,640
should be handled all the way down to the very basics of water it's fascinating to watch people

110
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,260
who are actually trying to accomplish something accomplish it and it's been very interesting that

111
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,640
Skype group you said it's coming to an end soon yeah it's done already and in the next what they

112
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,880
call Thursday I don't know what's today the 7th or the 6th the 6th of February so the 8th of the

113
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,140
morning of the 8th it'll we're gonna nuke it so it's not a public thing so anything well you know

114
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,720
what I say anything you put on the internet is like taking your garbage can out to the curb right

115
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,060
you can't get upset for people using it so your point of reference is you'll see a date on this

116
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,240
but the thing is I'm gonna put it out on what they call a Wednesday so when you see that

117
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,080
or even sooner might do a surprise and pull it sooner or later I don't know but I've been putting

118
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,160
things up there and we'll just see what happens because the whole thing is I wanted to see who

119
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,400
else is interested and really it's getting to the point well who can really do it you know yeah

120
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,560
that's all I have to say about that but one of the messages you got pertains to it regarding

121
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,200
or where's the material going right stuff like that well that is one of the questions that I kind

122
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,800
of had way back and I've sort of gotten lost just sort of observing this and you know I would

123
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,360
suggest if you are in on that group and a lot of people that do listen to rated wire in on that

124
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,060
group I would say you know collect your stuff up and hang on to it so you can go back over it

125
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,800
because I'm gonna and I think it'll be an opportunity to have a point of reference for

126
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,660
whatever was going on a couple of people have actually done some work and I think that's a you

127
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,640
know that that's something that should be you know what would you say commended you know for

128
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,020
actually taking action but one of the big questions I had from the beginning is okay

129
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,480
it's not a filter it doesn't take stuff and collect it in you know a mesh screen or a coffee

130
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,580
filter ends up really dirty because it collected up oil you know this kind of thing where does

131
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:30,420
stuff go because you would think okay even with things being moved or things being trained yeah

132
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:37,100
that's there's a question of the nature of stuff yeah like anything okay go back to Plato it's all

133
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:44,680
shadows on the wall if you look at just to jump in hard and fast on this the the scientists that

134
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,540
are looking they're using some kind of scattering technology to show you an image of an atom which

135
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,920
is total bullshit right but they will tell you that there's nothing really there you know when

136
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,460
that in other words is that closer they look at the densest material the less dense it becomes right

137
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,380
right right but you look at a mud puddle let's go back to the you know basic and third grade

138
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,020
science even in you know what they call schools you know same thing they call fish that just

139
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,080
happen to be swimming in a clump but anyway yeah so you take a look at a puddle of water that's

140
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,620
you want to take the mud out of the water because you want to be able to use the water without the

141
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,580
mud you don't want to well hold on this is going to get interesting here and confusing maybe there's

142
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,540
another device that does that the scale orators purpose was to increase water quality yeah it

143
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,980
does remove a lot of stuff out of the water meaning hard minerals yeah it drops the TDS

144
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,920
which is told dissolved solids which measures TDS measures total dissolved solids it's an

145
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,780
acronym for that right so usually we get when it's properly set up the higher the solids are

146
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,140
the more reduction up to 50% I've seen 80% reduction right okay and and when you see an

147
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:03,000
80% reduction it means that 80% of the material that was dissolved in the water is now gone right

148
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,200
so but there is another device I call it the turbid orator that may never see the light of day

149
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,720
it's for several reasons in order to do proper research on it I need turbid water so I'm not

150
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,980
going to keep harvesting pond water from a local park or golf course and very few people actually

151
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,920
have a turbidity water problem but this device also not the scale orator it's her bitterator

152
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,800
it does something very very very very very unusual and it has again magnetic reactors they're not

153
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,780
there employs magnets but it doesn't use it uses magnetism but in a completely different way I've

154
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,060
shown this and explained it to several people that have like nuclear engineering background and

155
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,220
they were they were like oh my gosh you'd really do you see the potential and they went down a list

156
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,220
of things that could be done with it I'm like yeah but it's not going to really help anyone

157
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,340
you know at this point it's very specific and it's very intense but yeah well I mean off the top of

158
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,700
my head just really fast off the top of my head I mean one of the instant things that jumps to my

159
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,500
mind is how about desalinization that's always been sure a grand idea it's not really for that

160
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,060
but it is going in that direction yeah because it's her bitterator is about three or four times

161
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,260
more powerful in the scale orator in its application maybe more and it actually does

162
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,100
have a scale orator in the center of it it's a it's it's minimum three come three separate

163
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,240
components working together in unison yeah this is really cool and I think people that have known

164
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,780
me for over a decade or so know that I've always worked on water and I've said that you know what's

165
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,280
possible you can make just a pipe nothing in the gut and put dirty water through that pipe and on

166
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,800
the other end clean water comes out right oh yeah I've been telling people this for a long time you

167
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,560
have and one of the like I said a key use would be I mean just the very simple I mean even a monkey

168
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,740
can figure out look the planet has plenty of this salt water all over the place well that's too much

169
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,580
you don't know well actually there's more freshwater than salt water it's just not available it's

170
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,359
underground well and the difficulty is the location the ability to harvest it no no there's

171
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:15,520
no difficulty the difficulty is the perception of it there's plenty of equipment there's lots of

172
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,140
equipment and lots of where with all the knowledge and how to get water where you can just make one

173
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,900
hole in the ground it'll feed an entire city and you don't even have to pump it up of pure clean

174
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,520
water but it's not it's not for this group of people here so but anyway let's let's get back

175
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,140
to the topic and hand the person brought up monoatomic elements and when you bring it when

176
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,120
you hear that and you speak to orthodox conventional people in science they're gonna think you're

177
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,800
referring to like the noble gases right no things that don't they're also called monoatomic meaning

178
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,360
they don't combine with any other element but just to the long and the short of it I do have

179
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,940
monoatomic rhodium and gold and in its purest form made by date the David Hudson crew group they're up

180
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,580
a hundred miles north of me so and these are the originators of the process let's say modern day

181
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:13,520
what I would suggest it is it's not necessarily going to monoatomic but it is in a way what the

182
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,560
scalarator does how else would you say it it's a quality issue with the scalarator where monatomics

183
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,850
that I wanted to get into a little bit is not necessarily monoatomic it's just a state of

184
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:34,390
matter and they will tell you this when you get into you know the airy fairy or miss stuff it's a

185
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,350
state of matter so just like you have a plasma state it's like that it's if you we would go back

186
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,570
and you know you're gonna hear a lot about yin and yang with Greek speak unless we come up with

187
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,070
another way to explain it when you say monoatomic gold or any other element that is in its most

188
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,270
young state its most contractive state and because it is such an extremely contractive state that it

189
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:03,250
appears to be very light because each aspect of it contracts into a tiny tiny particle very light

190
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:10,050
in color and fluffy like a very light powder like the finest dust you can imagine right and it's

191
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:16,510
because it's extremely young now metallic gold the heavy bar of gold that shiny yellow orange

192
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:24,350
color that is a much more yin state like for example the last young element on the periodic

193
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:31,070
table would be platinum anything beyond platinum larger than platinum is yin I mean it starts to

194
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,690
expand right so if you want to turn more base metals which would be more young than platinum

195
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,810
into gold you have to learn how to make them more yin so what do you know about making things yin

196
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:55,170
consequently when monoatomic elements are found or identified by whoever not the noble gases that

197
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,830
orthodox sciences but the ones that the airy fairies talk about the white powders that is just

198
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:07,890
an extremely young state so how do you get things to be into a very young state now tie it back to

199
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,830
the scalarator what it's doing the scalarator is it's allowing the dielectric inertial plane

200
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,690
more like Ken Wheeler talk but that's what it is it's actually referred to as the inertial plane

201
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:27,770
to affect the center flow of the water and the water is just as magical as using the inertial

202
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:33,570
plane of the magnet which is the part of the magnet that no one uses at all now we're running

203
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:41,710
an incredibly sophisticated element or water is an element it's not a compound don't be fooled

204
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,350
by them telling you it's hydrogen and oxygen so you put hydrogen oxygen together you will get some

205
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:52,430
water but if you cannot take water and turn it into hydrogen oxygen completely so you have this

206
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,050
magical thing let's just use that phrase loosely known as water going around the most magical part

207
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,850
of the magnet which is not considered magnetic at all incredible things are going to happen right

208
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,590
and and I'm the only one that's doing this publicly and I've been looking at this for a

209
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:14,850
while and the only one still pushing on it I've spoken to academics physicists engineers all kinds

210
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:22,070
of people and they have no input at all nothing zero nada because they're hampered by their you

211
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,050
know background right and then of course that's when I talk to people that are physicists and

212
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,950
engineers I said I kind of like don't impose but I do to some to some of them I'm look I'm not

213
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:39,750
looking for an academic or an engineer looking for someone who is very what intuitive right you may

214
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,110
not even know how to read and write I would even prefer that but if you're intuitive and you get

215
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:51,950
the concept can we can we brainstorm even just to get figured between myself and somebody else

216
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,170
we'd have at least a half a dozen brain cells that work so we can brainstorm and come up with a

217
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,490
better solution now the reason this is from a managerial point of view see managers if you

218
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,570
can't measure you can't manage it so from a managerial point of view the more understanding

219
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:14,130
we have the more better we can manage it and advance it right now it's hard to advance it

220
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,310
because we really don't know what's going on so what what part of it do you advance right you might

221
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,350
actually think you're making it better and you're actually making it worse right because you don't

222
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:30,570
comprehend it but what we do comprehend and have realized is that what is considered as raw bulk

223
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,170
matter brutal matter is disappearing before our eyes when it runs through this device as long as

224
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:43,070
that matter is in water and it's consistent and they're the one that I've been showing in public

225
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:49,910
you know this is turning into a call about the scalarator it seems or a sonic event the one

226
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,130
that I keep showing is the most dumbed-down version there are other versions like the super

227
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:01,630
scalarator I call it the 700 I did post a picture of that it's the one that goes into the condo with

228
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:11,450
more wraparound other people experimenting but if you don't know more exactly what mechanism or see

229
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:17,270
if it's not if it's not material how can you call it a mechanism the effect the true effect the

230
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:23,350
basis of it we can't go any further so I am just always just showing the most dumbed-down which is

231
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,750
it's a very elegant it's a very simple spool one bend around you know magnetic core you notice that

232
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,930
it's not met we're not using the magnet or using the right the magnetic fields we're using the

233
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:42,870
magnetic fields where it's null and it's just a single loop very precisely made and that's it

234
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,990
there are other versions that are actually more intense and do a little bit more but it's not

235
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,230
necessary to put that out because you got to start somewhere right well and the issue is that it's

236
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,150
it's rather difficult to relate any of this to somebody if they don't have a standard by which

237
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,610
to measure it and the standard to measure it doesn't work because well we measure it by outcome

238
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,430
just like you'd measure heat or anything else yeah right well this is this is like the weather

239
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,150
work by the way we don't know when I work with the weather we talk about working with the ether I

240
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,490
don't know exactly what the ether is but I know if I do this then this it will do that right same

241
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,510
thing with this this is okay another way to look at it it's ethereal and going back to the mono

242
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,610
atomic elements you know the white powders from you know the or miss and all that one thing you

243
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,670
could nail down on that is that is the most young state of whatever material and as the material

244
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,950
gets heavier and shinier and more metallic you know keep going down the periodic table as the

245
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,930
numbers get larger it's becoming more and more yin so it's actually a very simple concept someone

246
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,990
did put in the chat on the last sonic I mentioned the internet is spreading and spreading and

247
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,430
spreading and spreading and spreading and spreading and spreading to the 10th power what is that

248
00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:01,970
that's yin so the counter reaction would be an extremely young reaction an extremely young

249
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:10,010
reaction is something very focused and it would be very small all over the place like pores on your

250
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:16,150
skin under a microscope would be the young aspect you know the skin is very yin covers the whole

251
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:21,050
body and well some people you can see the pores on them without a microscope but and if you look

252
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,490
within the pore there are these tiny hairs like the peach fuzz aspect of hair right not long hairs

253
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:33,290
and dark hairs or pubic hairs but very thin hairs that grow between the hairs those are young

254
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:40,190
manifestations so what what I'm trying to say here this person liked the analogy that the internet

255
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:45,350
is as something keeps spreading its opposites gonna have to manifest something that's very

256
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:51,050
contractive that's why for example I gave the analogy tied laundry detergent they spend a

257
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:59,970
hundred million a year on advertising and no one's clicking on their ads no one at all I mean well you

258
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,350
know no one you know for a hundred million dollars worth right so everyone's clicking on what all the

259
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:14,190
little micro companies that plant-based this we're a local Colorado soap company we're like this weird

260
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,810
you know make using frog eyeballs you know whatever you know I mean all the really tiny

261
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:24,390
little craft soaps and all that everyone's clicking on all of those and there are thousands of those

262
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,430
other companies but no one's clicking on big companies anymore so so this is again ye applying

263
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,770
yin and yang so you can apply this yin and yang principle to everything and it always works and

264
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,310
that's going back to the simulation well there's one other principle hacking the simulation yeah

265
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,090
there's one other principle here that needs to be recognized and that is that look from a

266
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:51,150
standardized you know the academic the sort of normie world of things right the fact that it's

267
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:59,030
not visible to them the fact that it's not observable by them with the tools they have

268
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:07,270
that's where that's where the breach is see well hold on the academics every academic anyone that's

269
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,550
gone past the eighth grade and especially that's taken a career with college and university and

270
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:17,750
continue those studies yeah is an actor yeah is a player is a chump in other words they know down

271
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,150
in their heart that if they don't do what they're told right by the administration or the trustees

272
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:31,030
they are out of there right so to me they're chumps are they offering a service perceptively

273
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,210
to the ignorant public the ones that watch the Super Bowl right for them they offering a service

274
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,390
of distraction but for people like myself or other people trying to advance anything no they

275
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,770
have absolutely they could stand by the door and hold the door open they have absolutely no use

276
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:53,110
at all for me or anyone that's working on stuff that you know requires realism right but here's

277
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,650
the thing what what occurs here is that the reason okay this is gonna be a little hard for me to

278
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:05,310
explain bear with me just a minute the thing is that even though things are happening and they

279
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,430
are very significant because they are not visible to what they used to call the naked eye right

280
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:16,250
there were people that would say that those things simply do not exist because they're not able to

281
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,990
observe them in the standard way that they understand they should be able to observe things

282
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,390
so here's the thing does it matter if you can't see it on a microscopic level because there's the

283
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,630
fractal nature of things right of course you'll see it in a large like if you have very tiny

284
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:38,730
nanoparticles and you blow them through a fan in the parking lot and they make a dust cloud

285
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,650
they're actually going to form a similar geometric shape to what one particle would

286
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,950
look like under a microscope it's kind of it's called chaos theory right well it's a way to

287
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,830
demonstrate it but the point I'm trying to make here is is is pretty interesting I think in that

288
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:03,590
if it is not observable right there are like okay with the scalarator right if it's not observable

289
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:09,170
you need intuition right and you're using so you need intuition to get there but then you have the

290
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,110
end result which is demonstrable demonstrable right that's right and that's how you measure

291
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:20,770
the the the gains of the work that you've done right so if you've done all this work using

292
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,750
intuition and nothing gets better nothing changes or you haven't met any perceptible goal

293
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,790
you have no gains and now you might want to stop take a break yeah now smoke and a coffee and

294
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:37,370
reassess and not going down that direction right now anymore it's not giving you any benefit so

295
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:42,190
the only problem that really you have here but like release this to the world and the whole

296
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:49,030
world would use it is that you don't have to say never do that no especially now we're in extremely

297
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:56,350
this is where the spiral expands divergent this is where society is ready to disassociate of course

298
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:01,550
and you do not want to if you try to address the entire society the whole world you just

299
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,950
f yourself big time yeah of course uh yeah what you want to address is a small group of people

300
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,130
that might take interest and those that you've gotten the attention that might take interest

301
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:18,830
satisfy those that do have the interest so right with anything that you do by the way I see so you're

302
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,070
utilizing that as the step in between because you don't have the measurement the tools for

303
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,070
measurement capable of showing them the process what I just said has nothing to do with the

304
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,230
measurement it has to do with the state of the world yeah no I guess if you lived on the planet

305
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,270
where there are like a hundred thousand people and maybe a few thousand little tribal villages

306
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,850
with 50 people each yeah you could probably get your what you're doing to each one through your

307
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,670
lifetime you travel yeah right and you might go to each village right but this is too spread out

308
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:57,190
and too divergent and it's it's too degraded and but within those pockets there are people that

309
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:04,110
are interested right just it's all right more specific the scale rater is who is the client

310
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,890
someone who's interested into water in in water quality and well handcrafted artistically crafted

311
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,990
devices no different than someone who likes fine watches you really you know think about these

312
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:22,890
mechanical watches that cost tens of thousands right why you can get something with a little

313
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,330
battery in it that's just as accurate really you know that costs like less than 100 bucks but

314
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:34,550
there's an appreciation that something mechanical can achieve such accuracy in time they're not that

315
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,730
accurate by the way uh in time you know time keeping right but but it's just an appreciation

316
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,330
so this is strictly for someone as an appreciation and this goes for anything if you're an author

317
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,050
i hang out with authors in town and and you know i'll sit down with them and these are like ones

318
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:57,310
this one's a completely unrelated fields and uh they they have more personal concerns about what

319
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,230
they're doing meaning you know how to get their book going but uh it's really hard to convey to

320
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:09,130
them that you should never look for a big market always a very very small specific market and if

321
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,150
you go here here's another thing if you try to market to the whole world and everyone you will

322
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,230
no one will listen but if you market to a small group of people highly specialized

323
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:25,530
other people around them will find out about it and you'll get more play you'll get the better

324
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,590
chances of the whole world finding out about what you're doing that way and going directly trying

325
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,870
to market to the whole world well that's why the same thing goes with information they always select

326
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:40,210
a demographic they target it they narrow their scope so that they have a particular uh type of

327
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,830
people that have certain things it's beyond demographics it's like uh seth godin says

328
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,170
psychographics well that's why i said a scope within you know yeah it's like psychograph it's

329
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:57,070
this it's the mental you're looking for no longer is it okay you know spinning rims you know in the

330
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,970
ghetto you buy a car a toyota for two thousand dollars but you spend eight thousand on wheels

331
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,550
yeah right what kind of demographic is that if i if you were developing a company that sold wheels

332
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:12,110
for eight thousand dollars all for a set you would never think of some you know 18 year old with a

333
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,290
two thousand dollar busted corolla never but that's who's buying them i'm talking about you

334
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,370
know what was the fad that was going on two decades well that's why you gotta know what

335
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,250
your niche market it's a psychographic yeah in other words it's it's something based on the

336
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:33,930
the mental perception the mental state of of who you know uh would would get the product yeah like

337
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:40,130
i said no one's clicking on tide soap ads no one's clicking on ivory soap you know no one's clicking

338
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,490
on microsoft ads no one but thousands of people go to the michigan soap company that says they

339
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,730
have the most natural soap flakes you know that they hand make yeah what are the little because

340
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:55,570
you have to understand the union we are in the outward divergent spiral everything is in

341
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:00,830
dissolution right it's going into dissolution dissolution into the ether dissolving there

342
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,530
there's no more great people there are no more great things being done that affect them other

343
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:09,909
than a big-ass war which believe it or not is going to be really hard to do anyway it's always

344
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:13,650
from now on it's going to be a whole bunch of little wars until the big cosmic world comes

345
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:19,590
right right and we see that starting to unfold actually now a bit yeah they can't even get a

346
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,810
world war going right i'm serious bring it they keep they've been threatening it since uh people

347
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:30,070
don't know but they've been threatening since 2016 with the or 2014 with the first ukraine debacle

348
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:35,409
yeah right exactly yeah so they can't even get a world war going so because it's not about the

349
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,870
met it's not about doing it on a global level but for humans it's going to be on another
