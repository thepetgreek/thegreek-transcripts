1
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:33,460
So, there we go, a little pattern break, rated Y, 87, there we go, 87 is the sonic, now you

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,120
got to be real careful if you put that out in a public podcast and really don't tell

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,920
anybody, you, the subscribers, that we used it, because if we used it, they could come

4
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,160
after us.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,860
Well, sort of, it's 17 years, it's copyright no more, unless they redo it and resell it,

6
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,280
I don't know.

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,980
No, they didn't.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,700
That's one of my favorite lyric songs, I said, just play this, just to do something different.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,400
Look up the lyrics on that, by the way, anybody.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Yeah, it's a Night Flight cover, and we played the YouTube clip here, but tell you what,

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,040
check with your friends who are actually competent when it comes to all the crap that they write

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,120
that they call laws, because it is insane, the level of copyright law and stuff that

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,680
they do now, not just the automated, you know, things like that.

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,560
Well, this is actually a cover, actually, it's not, hmm, let's just say this way, the artist,

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,100
it's a YouTube channel, let's see who he has drawn a cover.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,220
On my old YouTube channel, just real quick, on my old YouTube channel, right, I covered

17
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,640
a Black Sabbath tune in 1993, I took the recording of that, which was a live recording,

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,960
and put it up on my old YouTube channel, and with the new arrangements in 2022, just before

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,120
they deleted my channel, guess what, they caught what the song was, and they threatened to

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,240
hit me with it if I made any sort of profit whatsoever, even if I monetized it, or whatever

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,100
from it, and it was using me playing the song, it was me singing, it was a Black Sabbath

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,139
cover that didn't really sound like the original, but was, you know, based on the original,

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,240
like a fair cover is, it's recognized, it's different.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,260
I get it, they're just milking for what they can, because they know they don't have a lot

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,900
of time left.

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,860
Right, right.

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,780
It's always, that always happens, yeah.

28
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,780
As you reach the end, things get contracted, and then they expand to the point where they're

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,580
out of control, which is coming, and so right now they're just, you know, they know they're

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,920
going to lose it, lose everything, so might as well get as much as you can before, that's

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,480
the capitalism, you know, when you're done using it, or you can't use it, you destroy

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,240
it so no one else can, right, so.

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,080
Oh yeah, absolutely.

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,500
Although today, you know, if we wanted to, we could draw the Steamboat Willie version

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,820
of Mickey Mouse and use it, but not the later versions.

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,340
Anyhow, I'm just throwing out, I'm throwing out ridiculous covers.

37
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,540
It's all about how you, how you posture it, right, the posture and the presumption, so

38
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,580
you can't prove that it's exactly the same one.

39
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,460
Anyway.

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,420
Well, that's what I'm saying, is now if it's recognizable to a certain degree, the algorithm

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,240
catches it, and then they drop it into this, you know, book-length laws, allegedly, right,

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,060
that tell you the rules about all this stuff, and at the end of the day, it is exactly what

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,480
you said, but the funny part is, they made it so complex, as with most things, that common

44
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
folk can't understand it, and it just makes it functionally impossible to utilize stuff

45
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,980
from other artists.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,340
But do the artists still get paid?

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,080
That's another thing.

48
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,500
Are they still getting ripped off?

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,020
Another whole conversation, when we're talking about the flow of energy tonight, probably,

50
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,860
that could go into this, right?

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,960
An artist creates, and then an artist is supposed to be able to, what, be able to spread that

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,540
around and benefit from their creation, their hard work, their craft.

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,800
Well, sort of.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,180
It's what programming you have, because listening to someone who's a business advisor, and he

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,020
interviewed someone who was a CPA, and it's like, oh my gosh, what rubbish, he's talking

56
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,200
about, you know, paying taxes.

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,080
How can you pay taxes on money that's created out of thin air, right?

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,740
So it's not paying taxes, it's something else.

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,300
Then he says, the reason why medical school is so expensive is because the doctor knows

60
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,760
he has to pay a lot in insurance.

61
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,060
That's all the doctor knows.

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
Isn't he supposed to know how to perform his duties on the, you know, so you see, everything

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,500
is so askew.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
Everything this guy said was an idiot, by the way.

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
Idiot just means, like, self-centered.

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,000
He's like one of the best CPAs in the country.

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,120
Everything he said was patently false, but to the normies, it would sound like he is an

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
authority on what he's saying is true.

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,500
Right.

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,420
So, right?

71
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,600
A consistent idiot is at least better than, or slightly better than, a broken clock.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,180
I mean, he's right more than twice a day.

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,720
Well, I've been doing this for a while, looking at these so-called experts, and nothing that

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,700
they say is in context of reality.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,220
It's in context of what the normies believe, and it's insane.

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
It's just pure insanity.

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,300
I think that's why we do the Greek-speak aspect, but in terms of the artists, like Picasso said,

78
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,480
the meaning of life is to find out what your gifts are, and the purpose of your life is

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
to give them away.

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,080
There you have it.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,380
This is one of the best artists, supposedly, of the modernist movement and cubism, so what

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,520
about the artists getting paid with what?

83
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,860
You know, it's just bizarre.

84
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,260
So, the thing is, it's just like we're just, before we start recording, talking about fine

85
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,140
chocolate, right?

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Right.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,920
You know, it's really like a medicine.

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,140
You know, one of the things that I attribute getting over the circus flu with was I slammed

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,160
like three pieces of chocolate, very dark chocolate truffle of high quality, and I just went to

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
bed for six hours, and I got up feeling great.

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
I feel like I shook it, right?

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,060
Right.

93
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,820
So, it was definitely a frequency change, right?

94
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,260
I think I brought up, past Sonic, this is very serious to consider.

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,940
When you, let's say, acquire, contract, and do something, an illness that makes you feel

96
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:14,480
very sick, and you actually behave like you're sick, almost kills you even, what that ailment

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,940
is trying to do is change your DNA, not the DNA that you hear about.

98
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,140
It's trying to change your genetic sequence, because genetic sequences are constantly firing

99
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,940
in your body.

100
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,860
And, you know, you can recreate a human just from a hair or a nail now.

101
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,080
Years ago, you needed a sufficient amount of blood or a certain amount of tissue.

102
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,900
Now, it can be done from the slightest bit.

103
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,740
I bet it could even be done from just fingerprint oils, right?

104
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,600
So, your genetic material is constantly moving, some of it very quickly, some of it much slower.

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,140
And an illness goes after that coding, right, after the code.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,540
That's why I also, suffice to say, paraphrase, what did they call those last series of injections

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,980
that they wanted everyone to get?

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,880
They were mRNA modifiers, which is coding, again, RNA, DNA.

109
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,260
You know, the difference between DNA and RNA is RNA is pretty much indestructible, right,

110
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
as a protein.

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:21,720
That's where you get your RNA is where you get what they call mad cow, and, oh, what's

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,360
the formal?

113
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,220
Prions.

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,380
Right, the prions.

115
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,960
Very toxic.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah, it's a bent protein, basically.

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,900
So essentially, I kind of went really deep on this circus flu thing, and I was like,

118
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,980
what is this thing trying to do?

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,080
Because whenever I get something, I've never gotten this ill ever in my life, other than,

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
you know, when you're really young as a child, and you have the flu, you know, and the stomach

121
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,500
bug, you know, really young, and you remember that, right?

122
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,140
Yeah, absolutely.

123
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,020
Well, I've never gotten anything like that, and I pondered on it, meditated on it.

124
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,460
You know, I hope everybody here knows that meditation doesn't mean to empty your mind,

125
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,720
right?

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,280
Right.

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,740
Like paying taxes, right?

128
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,300
No, like emptying your mind.

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,940
It's the opposite.

130
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,060
You have to focus on something, and you look at it from every facet.

131
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,140
When I pondered it for several weeks, and it got really intense, I was like, this damn

132
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,820
thing is trying to change my genetic code.

133
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,580
It's trying to turn me into something else.

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,500
Maybe turn me back into a frog, right?

135
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,220
Maybe.

136
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,340
Anyway, yeah, I just need to bring that up, because you could tag that concept along with

137
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:31,220
all the other concepts that we discuss regarding the human body, and I did post a couple of

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,080
weeks ago a Michio Kushi video in the chat, the Otelian, the Greek Chitango.

139
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,919
Actually, we just had someone who's been listening, subbing for a while, but didn't know about

140
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,640
the Chitango.

141
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,800
He actually posted that he just found out about the Chitango recently, and I posted

142
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,480
a Michio Kushi video on there.

143
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
He's a master teacher.

144
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:59,100
I posted it here on what they call January 24th, and just watch like the first 12 minutes

145
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,260
of that, because when we brought up talking about the movement of energies, we also did

146
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:17,380
a sonic on Feng Shui, or if you're from Texas, it's Feng Sui, but watch that video.

147
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
It's posted there.

148
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,800
I can give you the, let's just click on it and see what it's called, Formation and Function

149
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
of the Spirit.

150
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,240
Right.

151
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,140
Audio note for the listener, by the way, it is Otelian, the Greek, all one word, dot Chitango

152
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,240
with one T, dot com.

153
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,900
That's where you can find the chat, where people are interacting, and it's open to the

154
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,220
public and all, but unless you know about it, you don't go there, so I'm trying to make

155
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,800
people aware.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,780
The video is called Formation and Function of the Spiritual Body and Chakras, and Faya

157
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,220
Kushi is his son who posted it.

158
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,100
Now, the reason I wanted people to see and follow just the first 12 minutes of that is

159
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:07,460
to get a feeling of what a master teacher does and is in terms of, and what I'm going

160
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,160
to do real quick here for you, Chuck, since we're on, I'm going to do a quick screenshot.

161
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,180
You may not be able to see it, but maybe if you follow it along later, we could talk about

162
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,460
that video in the future, or yeah, very interesting, because that ties along with everything.

163
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,340
What he's basically showing that if you're into the model they tell us about the sun

164
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,040
and the planets and all that, he shows how the energies move, and it actually forms a

165
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,860
human body, right?

166
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:37,340
So when you talk about architecture, when you talk about energies and all that, it seems

167
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,380
like accommodating the human body is what, or the human behavior is what you're trying

168
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,860
to do, and that statement sounds like, duh, of course, Greek, right, but there's an archetype

169
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,700
that lies below all of that notion, right, that has to be considered also, you know,

170
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,460
like a fractal.

171
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,860
Well, and that's the consideration I want to ask you about at this point, is that, you

172
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,640
know, is it really about accommodation of the human body, or is it simply that the commonality

173
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,860
of what is available as building blocks tend to fit together the same way, you know?

174
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,560
If nails work really, really well to put oak boards together, they might also succeed in

175
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,280
putting other types of wood together, simply because they're fairly effective.

176
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,200
Or nailing you to a tree.

177
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, or nailing you to a tree, sure.

178
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,820
All of these things work well.

179
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,020
I'm going to interject at this before we go on the state of feng shui, yes, I've brought

180
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,860
up a little, okay, if you want to study feng shui, as it would be called with the native

181
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:46,580
tongue on the Cantonese side, or feng shui if you're from the American South, you know

182
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,940
how all through Greek speak, I'll interject, we'll bring up a topic, and the thing to interject

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,880
is stuff that you're not going to get anywhere else, right?

184
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,640
Because we can go ahead and talk about all the basics, it's a complete waste of time.

185
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,840
Even if there isn't, like microbiotics, for example, if you go online, or even get books

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,760
on study of macrobiotics, you're really not going to get much at all, very little.

187
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,280
You could, if you have someone that has like more old school understanding of it, guide

188
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,620
you through.

189
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,000
But you'll read a 300 page book and get a little bit out of it, and you'll think it's

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,580
about this, and it really isn't, right?

191
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,160
But here's the interesting part about the energies, there's a synesthetic part, which

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,680
synesthetic is like using dowsing and all that other stuff with feng shui that carries

193
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,300
over when you said about nails.

194
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,540
One of the things in the black hat feng shui, what they say is when you have a business

195
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,340
that's successful, you eventually might think of expanding and opening another one, right?

196
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,940
And in order to carry that success over, what you do is you remove a nail from the building

197
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,780
that the current successful business is in, and move it over and put it into the next

198
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,480
business to carry over that energy.

199
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,620
Typically a nail, you can also do like a shaving, a wood shaving, or a piece of tile, or something,

200
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,660
but a nail holds things together, right?

201
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,800
Has more energy, it's always under tension, right?

202
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,720
And compression.

203
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:18,160
So they suggest you take a piece of the area that you were successful, and move it over

204
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:27,880
to the new area, so that also carries through, like a germ, when you germinate, right?

205
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,400
Just bring a small amount over.

206
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,320
And also, by the way, among learned people, let's be honest, they do actually have a version

207
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,740
of this when they seek to build something of significance, whether it's in the fictional

208
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:46,740
world of Star Trek, or it's the buildings in Washington, D.C., they take a cornerstone

209
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,680
from one place, they take a stone from one place, and lay it strategically as part of

210
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,880
the foundation to another building.

211
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,380
I know I'm probably not using the proper term.

212
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,720
Or the entire, a lot of European cities brought stuff from Egypt, right?

213
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,460
Right, well they'll bring things from a location where something occurred that they wish to

214
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,660
carry over, and literally make it part of the new location.

215
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,120
Ship building, they do the same thing.

216
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,040
Like I said, represented in the Star Trek world, a piece of the legacy ship that is

217
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,020
named after, you know, that it's named after, they make the Enterprise ABCD, they take a

218
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,140
piece of the original ship that carried its name, and place it somewhere in the construction

219
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,680
of the ship.

220
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,560
Sure, an artifact, yeah.

221
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,080
By the way, do you guys know there is an atomic museum in Nevada, somewhere outside of Las

222
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,480
Vegas?

223
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,240
And a lot of people are still scratching their head why they have artifacts from the World

224
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,580
Trade Center on 9-11 there.

225
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,660
They don't really just, they can't come out and tell you, right?

226
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,640
No, but what else would you put that there if it is indeed an atomic museum?

227
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,140
See, but there you go.

228
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,380
If you have, and that's something to note though, if you ever take a look deep into the

229
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,020
construction of certain things, if you find that there's almost nonsensical ceremonial

230
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,500
things that are added to the construction of it, it gives you a big hint about the

231
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,400
intent that they're carrying from one place to another.

232
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,620
And literally, there are parts of Washington, D.C., you know this, where they've literally

233
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,200
made parts of other buildings part of the foundation of said new building, right?

234
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,020
So again, it's one of those things you do.

235
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
And if you think about it, it's part of the natural world.

236
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,280
I mean, indeed, you carry through genetics, which I think is poorly understood, you carry

237
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,040
parts of the original code, right, from somewhere else into something else.

238
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,220
People talk about their ancestry and all this.

239
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,840
Well, that's what it's about.

240
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,700
You're literally carrying a piece of them.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,880
Like a weird concept to think about is that at some point or other, you resided, a part

242
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,940
of you that went into making you literally resided in the body of your grandmother.

243
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,200
Well, water.

244
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,380
Well, how much water do you need to carry over to have that water be the same water?

245
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, water is poorly understood, again, and we could go to that, but as far as the second

246
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,760
water, the literal thing that I'm talking about is you actually at one point lived in

247
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,660
your grandmother's body.

248
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,460
How do I know that?

249
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,020
Because the literal ovum part, right, the part of the woman that goes into making the

250
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,080
baby when it links up with that other piece, is what?

251
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,900
In your mother's body your whole life.

252
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,000
She's born with it, right?

253
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,920
Well, yeah.

254
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
And she, right.

255
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,940
Well, it's the water.

256
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,220
Just a tiny amount of water carries the memory.

257
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,760
It's not necessarily the sperm or the ovum itself.

258
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,540
It's that those sperm and the ovum are containers for the water.

259
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,020
Oh, yes.

260
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,200
But a way to understand this.

261
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
And the water working with the rest of the structure does what it does.

262
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, but a way to understand this, which is not usually considered, is that literally

263
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,180
if the ovum, if a woman is born with all of her ovum intact that she's going to have throughout

264
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,240
her lifetime, then that means it started in your grandmother's body where she had it.

265
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
And then she was born.

266
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,300
She comes out.

267
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,160
She makes you.

268
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,940
That's literally part of you.

269
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,580
And you're right.

270
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,500
It is the container.

271
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,500
And it carries the water.

272
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,079
And it's, you know, very small.

273
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,140
So the idea of cutting the goose open to get all the golden eggs at once was probably an

274
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,660
affirmation of what we're talking about, right?

275
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,319
Well.

276
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,140
Supposedly you have all the eggs at once, right, and give them off at a certain time.

277
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,079
Well, that's the idea.

278
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,980
We don't really know.

279
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,980
We have to just trust.

280
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,640
But here's the thing with medical stuff.

281
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,460
I would trust the the anatomy more than the process side, than the physiology side, which

282
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,080
is unbelievably contorted and dysfunctional.

283
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
And misleading the way that they've recorded it.

284
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,340
But initially, even when they were just cutting people open and being surprised about what

285
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,820
they found inside, even back then, you could trace what it is I'm talking about.

286
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,700
So and literally, you could find this sort of concept in books from a time period where

287
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,280
you would say they're at least, you know, somewhat informative in the late 1800s, 1920s,

288
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,760
the latest.

289
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah.

290
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,460
Yeah.

291
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,640
But but I just point that out as a concept of in the natural world.

292
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,120
There is, you know, the idea of a piece of something literally ends up being the next

293
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,200
thing and carrying over.

294
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,380
So there is clearly an energetic order to this in nature.

295
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,960
And the energetic happens in between.

296
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,460
You have the space in between the material.

297
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,560
The energy happens in that area.

298
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,580
People think there's energy and matter.

299
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,700
No, there is matter doesn't have energy to carry it.

300
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,640
Right.

301
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,520
But it doesn't have any aspect of energy.

302
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,420
It has.

303
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,380
It's a state of energy, but it's not energy.

304
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,060
So the energy is carried in the spaces between the spaces, between the spaces of material.

305
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,020
So you have space, right, which is undefined is.

306
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah.

307
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,560
So you have this another.

308
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,660
It's a field.

309
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,240
And that's why I say there's some yeah, there's some validity to the concept of epigenetics.

310
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
Back to your genetic discussion here, where you were saying, look, it's not about the

311
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,960
genetic code just as it stands, but what it does, because there is genetic presentation

312
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,380
and epigenetic literally means on top of the genetic.

313
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,840
It is the switches and the things that are happening that the reaction and the actual

314
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
process that goes on.

315
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,800
Well, that would be again, the feng shui and the architecture, which are feng shui is

316
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
considered to be geomancy, right?

317
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,360
Geomancy, which is, you know, working with the earth.

318
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,800
Right. And, you know, you could really mess up people with bad architecture.

319
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,880
Right. Look at like Skinner boxes or college dorms.

320
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,700
Right. Absolutely.

321
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,460
Yeah. So you could really squeeze them.

322
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,880
Right. That's typically when you look at the architecture, it's squeezing people into

323
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
spaces that make them uncomfortable generally.

324
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,740
Right. And when they get outside of the uncomfortable space and the outsourced now is

325
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,320
uncomfortable because visually it's askew.

326
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,580
You know, I think my criticism with architects is it's all about ego.

327
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,680
And I've witnessed this on many levels.

328
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,260
Right. They they they do things for their own ego and their portfolio.

329
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,620
Right. And of course, the bigger it is and the more expensive it is.

330
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,800
Right. So they have no interest in making it inexpensive for the client or or better

331
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,720
functionally, because you and I talked about that where you were pissing off architects

332
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,900
because basically you're like, look, save money.

333
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,200
And also this functions.

334
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,660
But that functionality is also indicative of what it is you're passing on.

335
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,320
Right. Because if you make a workspace, a living space, something that is

336
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,820
comfortable, that promotes, you know, an ability to get a good night's rest, that's

337
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,580
well constructed so that it would be it would be a living space within the workspace

338
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,000
that I wouldn't integrate.

339
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,320
I would always have a separate demarcation.

340
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,060
Right. And even that consideration right there is part of the process, because other

341
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,240
people might say, look, we just need a big space, you know, which, by the way, I'm

342
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,560
looking for a space, by the way, a workspace for, of course, you know, the water

343
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,200
stuff that we've been talking about a lot here and, you know, and others.

344
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah. Because, you know, working a workspace that you work in is fine, like an

345
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
artist studio. Right.

346
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,980
But if you have a workspace where you invite other people to come and work also, it

347
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,700
gets a little tiring when a company, you know, it's over where you would live.

348
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,740
That's why it's important to have if you're going to live work in the same space, to

349
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,340
be able to demarcate an area which is more private.

350
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,800
So like we talked about in past Sonics, doctors that have, you know, the front of

351
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,980
their house is devoted to the doctor's office and they live in the back, this kind

352
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,460
of thing, or even hairdressers.

353
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,420
Same thing where they have like a, you know, the parlor is called the parlor.

354
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,700
The parlor is up front.

355
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,760
Right. So anyway, I'll shut up now and let's get back to this.

356
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,060
But I just wanted to point out that that, you know, and throw these ideas on the table

357
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:42,580
for you to to explore is that not only is there a concept here for you to work with,

358
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,400
but it already exists in nature.

359
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,700
And the idea that, you know, going with the behaviors of going with the river, so to

360
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:58,220
speak, you know, is a hell of a lot easier, but also a hell of a lot more efficient of a

361
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,640
way of accomplishing things if you're kind of going with the flow of the stream as

362
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,280
opposed to. Well, hold on.

363
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,780
You're going to have to also determine what kind of a river it is.

364
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Very few rivers run, let's say, from north south to north in the world.

365
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,380
Most of them run east, west or west east and a river.

366
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,440
And you have to understand the quality of the river.

367
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:27,320
So a river that runs, for example, west east will not have fertile banks.

368
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,580
It's either one. A river that runs from south to north, the western bank will always be

369
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,680
fertile in a river that runs north to south.

370
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,340
The eastern bank will always be more fertile, actually, that it could be either.

371
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,340
But most likely it will be the western bank.

372
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,960
But typically you'll see it on the west on all rivers that run up and down.

373
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,100
So you have to know where and how rivers work to figure out where you're going to put

374
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,980
yourself. Right. Some rivers are not.

375
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,460
Actually, conducive, you know, how people would settle around rivers because of the

376
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,600
water supply and the transportation and whatever.

377
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,140
Right. Right. Some of them are not viable.

378
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,400
So you have to make, in other words, the determination of architecture and fun and

379
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
geometry, where to put things on the land is a tough one.

380
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,480
And I've seen this recently with giving some water devices.

381
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,440
Someone has a water company and they misappropriated about four of them.

382
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,340
In other words, the water that people that had these wells at certain times of the year,

383
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,980
they'd have dark brown, rusty water coming out of the ground.

384
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,600
And they thought Scalarator would fix it.

385
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,240
And I'm like, no, it's not going to do that much.

386
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,620
If it would fix that, I wouldn't be talking to you.

387
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,940
I'd go to the Pacific and I would desalinate it.

388
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,840
Right. Right. Right. With the device.

389
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,140
So there is a device that could do that.

390
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,120
And, you know, that's called a Turbidorator.

391
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,260
But that's not going to be offered or really gone into in much depth in the near future.

392
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,960
There's no reason to because very few people have that kind of water.

393
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,500
And that was my point.

394
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,620
Why would you settle with a well?

395
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,620
First of all, right, you're in the wrong spot.

396
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,380
If you if your water source is that bad, you have made some really bad decisions or

397
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,860
you didn't drill deep enough.

398
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,440
And which is fine, because if you can't afford to drill deep enough now, you might

399
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,220
afford to afford it later, have them come back and drill deeper.

400
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,760
Because the truth about water in the earth is the deeper you go, the cleaner the water

401
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,240
gets. And if you go deep enough, you don't even have to pump it.

402
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,520
It comes up like a spring.

403
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,980
Right. There's a guy who talked about that primary water.

404
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,600
You have to go some sometimes you have to go more than two miles deep, which is not

405
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,020
that crazy, by the way.

406
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:46,280
Two mile deep well is uncommon, but it's done quite often and it's expensive.

407
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,360
But you would do something that would bring up quite a bit of water.

408
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,840
So there are these considerations and how much input and how much energy you're going to

409
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,900
put into something to get it to work for you.

410
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,920
Right. That's why when you look at a lot of the.

411
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,800
Ancient cities like Rome, we still have a the wishing fountain today, people drop

412
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,220
coins, they have these features of fountains in public spaces, make a wish, throw a

413
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,920
coin and they still do that, but they don't most people don't understand the origin of

414
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,920
that. This is, again, making an effort.

415
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,780
We've discussed this. I'll bring it up again.

416
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,920
Yeah. Because the Rome was growing to a point where it needed to sustain a bigger and

417
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,440
bigger population every year, they had contractors, people the government contracted

418
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,700
with to find water sources and build aqueducts and bring the water into Rome or

419
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,560
channel the water into Rome.

420
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,020
Sometimes it was done underground.

421
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,480
And before it was incorporated to be civilly and socially responsible before it was

422
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,660
incorporated into the general water supply, they would specify that the contractor with

423
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,100
the new water source would build a fountain and the water would go through a trial

424
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,520
period with the public for a certain amount of time before it was integrated into the

425
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,260
public works. So what they did was they threw metal pieces of metal into these fountains,

426
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,640
these test fountains and invited people to do so.

427
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,360
And if you threw, let's say the most typical thing that was metal was a coin.

428
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,380
So sometimes they would put the coins in there and examine them a week later and they

429
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,960
would be very heavily encrusted.

430
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,460
So they would judge that water as being fair and not very good.

431
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,420
Sometimes they would throw coins into the water and the coins would dissolve.

432
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,480
And that water was definitely not good for you because.

433
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,080
Right. Right. So so the water, the wishing well fountains that you see today as

434
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,420
features in place, public places, the main purpose of it never started out as a

435
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,120
wishing well, whether it was a lot, probably OK, never started out as a wishing.

436
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,820
Well, it was actually it had a scientific and civil purpose to find out if the water

437
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,460
quality was good enough. But then again, there is a slight amount of intent that went

438
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,860
into wishing because if the population was growing and growing and water was becoming

439
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,880
more scarce because of the growth of the city, you really wanted that new water source

440
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,240
to work, to be good.

441
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,600
Right. So you almost wish that it was good.

442
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,460
You say so the the civil part, the engineering part, people don't remember, but they

443
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,780
do remember the part where you just make a wish.

444
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,020
Right. You say much like most of this.

445
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,200
They remember the ritual, but not necessarily the practical purpose or the idea behind

446
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,680
the ritual. Well, there was.

447
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,900
Yeah, the the purpose was all practical and it and it had some ritual.

448
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,580
But then the purpose then it became all ritual, which I've discussed many times.

449
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:43,740
The woman who wears an expensive fur coat that drives a hundred thousand dollar SUV to

450
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,960
her, that's a ritual. She knows if she turns this round thing in front of her to the

451
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,780
left, the car goes to the left, goes to the right, push one pedal.

452
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,500
The car stops to push another pedal.

453
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,220
The car goes. It's a ritual.

454
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,660
She doesn't know anything about the machinery or how to fix it or if something goes

455
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,560
wrong, what went wrong, nothing at all.

456
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,540
So how much of your life of what you're doing is ritual?

457
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,920
And I would suggest even people who are listening about 90 percent of it is like we

458
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,740
started off. I was listening to this idiot CPA, supposedly best CPA in the country.

459
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,700
And he keeps talking about paying taxes.

460
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,760
How are you going to pay taxes when there's no money?

461
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,020
It's all credit. Right.

462
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,200
So actually, that's a ritual.

463
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,620
And actually, the the head of the IRS has gone on and said that many times.

464
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,940
He says, here comes April and the Americans have a ritual where they go and all pay

465
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,340
their taxes. It's a ritual.

466
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,320
But what really is going on is no government in the world right now has its own money

467
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,260
as it's supposed to. It's using money and borrowing money from a private banking

468
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:49,240
cartel. And just like anything that you use that is private, they require a report on

469
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,900
it. Or, you know, what have you how much have you used and a fee?

470
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,580
Just like, for example, you need a jackhammer to break a sidewalk.

471
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,840
And because you know, you need a jackhammer, a big, heavy one, because you tried it

472
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,140
with a mallet and you tried it with a sledgehammer.

473
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,420
So your neighbor said you got to go rent one of these tools.

474
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,000
And they're like three thousand dollar tools.

475
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,360
But you could rent it for a day for seventy five bucks.

476
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,600
Right. So you go and get the tool.

477
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,560
You break up the sidewalk, you bring the tool back and you just wave goodbye.

478
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,400
No, it doesn't work that way.

479
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,500
You you show what you you know, they examine the tool.

480
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,560
Right. And they make a report.

481
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,740
Yes, it's in fair condition.

482
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,080
And you have to pay rent on that.

483
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,120
That's exactly what's going on with the money system.

484
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,500
Every time you use the money system, you must have a report to send back to the

485
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,920
originator. Right. The private.

486
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,020
Right. And then you have to return back to them.

487
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,280
And they are they know that even though they can print money as they want to, to a

488
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,020
degree. Actually, they do use collateral.

489
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,580
Right. But they can make it as much as they want.

490
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,720
Actually, if they want to print money, all they do is send you a check, by the way.

491
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,580
And when you sign that check, that money.

492
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,720
Right. We've gone over that.

493
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,840
There's no need to go over it again.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,720
They can't use the money that you there's no government that could use any tax money

495
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,500
because it's just it's it's what there's nothing there.

496
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,440
It's just a ledger.

497
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,860
Right. They can make their we don't need your ledger.

498
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
We could use our own ledger.

499
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,180
Right. So why do they do that?

500
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,540
Is to create a sense of scarcity, like, you know, how there's discussion about

501
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,080
scarcity in the world. There is no scarcity of anything.

502
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,600
There's plenty of food. There's plenty of metal.

503
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,040
There's plenty of everything, plenty of cocaine for everyone if they want.

504
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,760
If they wanted to give every person on the earth a eight ball of coke once a month,

505
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,420
there's plenty of that to go around.

506
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,720
Right. Plenty of beef, plenty of veg, plenty of everything.

507
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,260
What there's a scarcity of is the credit that people use to exchange for these

508
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,460
things. Right.

509
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,000
That's why they have to keep this panic situation going where, oh, climate change

510
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,760
or terrorism. What's the next thing now?

511
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,440
You're going to have terrorism again pretty soon, by the way, in the Middle East.

512
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,060
Right. And all this, I've talked about that, you know, which we will get into the

513
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,720
future. So all this stuff ties into the ritual, which ties

514
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,660
into the original engineering, why fountains were people put coins

515
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,900
in fountains. Right. Which ties in originally to the design of a city, to

516
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
architecture and feng shui.

517
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,740
So how do you bridge something that feng shui or architecture was a very

518
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,420
geomancy, was a very exact science, practical.

519
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,240
But now when you bring up feng shui to people, oh, it's a what do you call it?

520
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,920
Airy theory. Oh, you know, it's mysticism.

521
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,600
It's superstition, new age superstition, urban legend,

522
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,880
myths. It's just like the wishing well at the at the mall.

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,120
Right. Right. People don't know the history of it.

524
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,380
Right. So when you bring bring these subjects up is no reason to do an entire

525
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,740
talk about architecture or geomancy, which is feng shui and all that, because

526
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,260
you can find that information anywhere on your own.

527
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,580
What you won't find is is the how serious this was and how much of a basis it

528
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,060
was for doing anything that was regarded to that subject, which which doesn't

529
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,180
carry over anymore.

530
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
It just doesn't carry over.

531
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,040
It can't. It can't into this society.

532
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,320
Why? Because you're overburdened with fictional things, right, that you have

533
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,920
more you take more seriously.

534
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,200
Right. So it's it's a kind of an interesting contrast.

535
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,900
But we go ahead and tell you in the Greek and Greek speak or whatever the stuff

536
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,860
I always try to make a penetrating move into the subject and also make fun of it.

537
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,020
Right. But you also and also give like people, you know, I always make up.

538
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,540
This is something that comes up a lot with brochures and archaics that everything's

539
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,460
underground. You know, all the elite.

540
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,520
Well, ever since I've been doing Greek speak, even before the Internet, I would always

541
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,260
describe people as surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

542
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,180
True. Right.

543
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,060
Always. Now, wait a second.

544
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,840
Does that imply we mean surface dwelling earth inhabitants?

545
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,100
Well, wait a second. What are you talking about?

546
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
We mean, like, where else are you going to live?

547
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,660
Right. We can't fly around in the air.

548
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,380
At least we can't. But they are.

549
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,660
But the reason why I was always specifying that is because the real society is not on

550
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,980
the surface. It's all underground.

551
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,700
And the reason why is it's a level of intelligence.

552
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,220
And I've gone through this before.

553
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,660
And this ties in with architecture.

554
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,280
I just built a new house.

555
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,040
OK. And to go with the new house, I just order all of your furniture.

556
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,200
So here comes the delivery truck.

557
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,140
OK. And OK.

558
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,140
Delivery truck comes on.

559
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,480
Neighbors are all over that big gas truck in that brand new house.

560
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,400
OK. I order all the delivery people in the furniture truck to put all the furniture on

561
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,600
the roof because I'm going to be living on the roof on my brand new house.

562
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,360
So how it goes. Nope.

563
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,820
Inside the house, the earth is your house.

564
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,660
So where do you with the intelligent people, industrious people live inside the earth,

565
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,980
not on the surface.

566
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,600
You see how it works. Well, I've always asked this question to people that go in depth

567
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,440
about the underground cities, the underground bunkers, the underground reality, you

568
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,460
know, and I've never seen it for myself.

569
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,520
But I would say, you know, look, here's the big question for you, though, because a lot

570
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,659
of them don't have an answer as to the following.

571
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,139
If you built all that stuff, is it just sitting there empty?

572
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,860
Never. You can't build a new house and leave it empty for more than a year to start

573
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,120
falling apart. Well, that's the thing, is that everything needed to be, let's just say

574
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,040
you built an underground.

575
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,940
It's lived in. It's always lived in a certain degree.

576
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,639
Yeah, because otherwise you don't know if anything functions in it does begin to fall

577
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,239
apart without people being in it.

578
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,179
I mean, unless it's under.

579
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,179
Yeah. And the energies are totally different.

580
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,660
I don't know if anyone here has been in a two mile deep hole in the ground I have in

581
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,720
Globe, Arizona. It's actually a secret goldmine.

582
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,920
And it really was a secret because every time we went down there, I went there twice

583
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
and they started digging in and they found that there was mining done there beyond

584
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,880
history that we have.

585
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,560
They had cut some. This is two miles deep.

586
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:17,240
And someone had cut some timbers that were a foot, foot thick and two feet wide and 20

587
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,180
feet long. Where do you get trees that size?

588
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,680
You can't get even trees that big.

589
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,000
And they were using that to support areas that they blasted.

590
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,280
So the way it works is you work all week and you take the weekend off.

591
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,520
Right. That's normal.

592
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,420
Right. OK. So you work all week.

593
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,180
Yeah. And on Friday night, what you do is you blast, you blast underground because

594
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,520
that dust is so fine.

595
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,600
It takes two days to settle.

596
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,780
So when you come back on Monday, everything's settled.

597
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Right. There's dead bats everywhere and stuff.

598
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,280
And you go and you find more stuff.

599
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,820
Yeah, it was very, very interesting experience.

600
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,380
But what I want to bring up forward for the sonic on the experience is when you go

601
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,020
really deep like that, you wear a sensor.

602
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,720
It looks like a pager and it's a CO2 and an oxygen sensor.

603
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,600
So if you know, if the CO2 goes too high or the oxygen goes too low, it notifies

604
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,340
you very basically like beeping.

605
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,120
Right. So it's not just lack of oxygen, but too much CO2 could also kill you, by the

606
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,720
way. Right. Of course. Yeah.

607
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,060
So that has both of those.

608
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,060
So anyway, you go down there and you feel the energies are completely different.

609
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,440
You feel completely surrounded.

610
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:27,340
And once you've experienced going deep into the earth like that and it was two

611
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,060
miles as as you walk, not straight down.

612
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,400
So I would say it was more than a mile deep or because it was a very steep, deep

613
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,800
decline. And there is you would have to get off and go vertically down a 40 foot

614
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,560
ladder and then go across again, almost like the pyramid.

615
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,000
You know, you would walk in the pyramid.

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,300
So what I would suggest is the feeling that I got from under there, if the

617
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,860
cavern or the space was big enough, you could definitely the the energy is

618
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,380
completely different than what you feel on the surface.

619
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,860
I mean, the intrinsic energy that your body feels.

620
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,860
And I could see how it could be a welcomed habitation.

621
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,860
No, definitely. This is all great, interesting stuff.

622
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,900
One thing that I would like to get to, though, is one of the other things that was

623
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,080
brought up in chat, if you don't mind, and that is, you know, the connection to

624
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,400
the older sonics about about the biblical stuff that you just mentioned.

625
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,640
We're going to see some terrorism, you know, in the Middle East.

626
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,740
Yeah, sure. Let me just let me just paraphrase.

627
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,380
Sure. The person there made a list of several items which I've covered in detail

628
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,120
quite a bit. But I am reconsidering all of it and really because of the archaic

629
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,500
chronology. Right. And looking at the sources of the biblical stuff and all that.

630
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,580
Now, the thing that I always this this is how, you know, you're dealing with a serious

631
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,060
biblical conversation.

632
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,060
The first thing, whenever you look up anyone or anything or anywhere, even school

633
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,880
academia, once they start having a biblical discussion, they must say that you must be

634
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,320
aware that the biblical text has never been translated out of Hebrew and Greek.

635
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,640
Only versions of it.

636
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,600
Right. So you got to start there.

637
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,080
Right. Because those are the languages of preservation, as you saw.

638
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,300
Exactly. And so if you have it in any other language other than Hebrew and Greek, it

639
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,960
probably it's probably 30 percent errors, direct like fatal errors, bad errors.

640
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,700
Right. So we have to go back to the to that.

641
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,060
Now, when you even even when you go back to that, I've had notes on this, but I never

642
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,360
quite look at it, whatever.

643
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,580
It's the Judeo-Christian authoritative aspect.

644
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,360
But I've been looking recently and many parts of the Book of Revelation and parts of

645
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,840
Genesis are found in other texts that predate the Bible and other cultures.

646
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,720
So can you say that it's written by Moses directly or Revelation

647
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,700
written by John directly at this point?

648
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,340
No, I wouldn't. Yeah, it is taken from other sources.

649
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,800
Do you know what you might know?

650
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,900
Yeah. Do you have the original letters that were written because you have a

651
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,520
compilation of not even that directly word for word, many verses from a completely

652
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,620
different text. So you can say it's a compilation.

653
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,380
Does it make it invalid?

654
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,800
No, it doesn't make it invalid.

655
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,880
Now, again, just to preface, whenever you have a biblical discussion, you must preface

656
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,220
that it's never been translated out of Hebrew and Greek.

657
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,160
So you if you bring up verses that you find in English, you must go back and examine

658
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,000
what was language of preservation.

659
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,780
The other thing this is shifting to the personal reason.

660
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,180
This is the Greek. The reason why I revere the Bible, because that's where I get my

661
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,880
law from. Right, right.

662
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,120
Right now, and I still know the laws of the state better than almost anyone I've ever

663
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,720
met, because all you have to do is read them with comprehension.

664
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,980
I do understand them and they're not they're not in conflict at all, by the way, if you

665
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,360
look at it carefully.

666
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,500
And just a hint there is the definitions of all of the state state and federal

667
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,840
statutes. The first usually first three sections or five sections are definitions.

668
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,440
When you read the definitions, you'll see what applies and what doesn't apply when.

669
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,320
But I use it for law.

670
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,940
So in other words, what's law?

671
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,640
What you eat, what you wear, how you keep time, how you deal with your family, how you

672
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,760
deal with neighbors on and on and on and on and on.

673
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,200
That's where I mean by law.

674
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
So that part doesn't really change much.

675
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,960
And that holds very well.

676
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:26,380
What I would look at some of the questions that the person put up there or the points

677
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,760
to discuss are very much chronologically based.

678
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,340
So one thing that I've mentioned is the seven year periods.

679
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,200
Right. And Archaic's gets into it being on the Greek Olympiad four year periods.

680
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,620
But I've also mentioned there's four and a half year periods, but still we're looking at

681
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,680
it two different ways. What I've always mentioned is a new period is going to start

682
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,040
around twenty twenty five in the fall of the fall or of twenty twenty four and the

683
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,120
spring of twenty twenty five.

684
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,680
And at that point, it'll be unmistakable that the Middle East is going to take the

685
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,860
lead in the world scene and be making.

686
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,040
That's where all the ruckus is going to be coming from.

687
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,480
And I mean, ruckus, which, by the way, coincides perfectly with the fact that during

688
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,140
that season is precisely when more than half of the world's election processes are

689
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,760
going on, by the way, just which is on the Greek Olympiad, what Archaic's discusses.

690
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,480
So I give him a lot of credit on that.

691
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,180
It's actually quite brilliant.

692
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,020
But what I've said, even if you heard Greek speak from 2010 or 2012, I did lay out all

693
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,320
those periods in the twenty twenty four.

694
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,940
Twenty twenty five is when the Middle East Union or Middle East focal point, you know,

695
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,660
it's remember when I say union, it's a loose confederacy.

696
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,920
It's not like the EU or the United States or Mexico.

697
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,240
But by the way, Mexico is also established by the way.

698
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,120
It's right. It's just how the US is various states called the United States.

699
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:03,200
So is Mexico. But anyway, you could look at nothing, nothing in that way under a federal

700
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,260
system. But it is going to be a center point.

701
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,380
So at that point, I can't prognosticate anymore.

702
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,140
And I've gotten all this from the biblical text, not from any other text.

703
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,480
Right. So you have to commend that aspect of it, you know, instead of looking at us.

704
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,260
But now I'm looking everywhere else, especially the Phoenix event and the recurrence of the

705
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,600
various things that he's bringing up.

706
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,480
And most of it seems to be fairly valid.

707
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,740
But again, I don't know.

708
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,300
All I can do is report what I found out.

709
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,400
And again, we'll go over the how about on the next Sonic, we'll go over the points that

710
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,880
the fellow mentioned, because we could go into depth and I think we should go into depth.

711
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,340
But so far, I'm quite confident.

712
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,040
I mean, this also ties in, which we didn't cover yet, which is about dreams also.

713
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,680
Right. If we really found out what was really going on in dreams and I mean, like more, you

714
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,980
know how we just found out what the wishing well fountains were really for initially.

715
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,900
Well, if we get that deep into dreams, I think we've really hacked this reality and there's

716
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,620
no need to be here anymore at all.
