1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,750
Sonic 88 rated Y, here we are.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,970
Anyway, how are you doing tonight, Greg?

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,490
I'm doing well, yeah.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,510
Long days, and we usually record at 8pm on a Tuesday and a Saturday, right?

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,290
What's called a Tuesday or Saturday, so it's a Tuesday.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,950
And yeah, I feel like I need a nap, again.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:35,110
You know, I bring up the expansive, contractive nature of things, and going back to scriptural,

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,890
you know, people always talk about higher and lower, it's the way we've been trained

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,310
in this iteration of our age.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,950
But if you go back to scripture, it's inner and outer.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,950
It's the inner circle and the outer circle.

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,870
I've been bringing up much of the yin and yang lately, which is, again, inner and outer.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,790
Expansive, right?

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,530
Well, when you say higher and lower, just really quickly, when you say higher and lower

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,990
and you're correcting that, I mean, there's a lot of ways to look at that.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,410
You do mean the above and below kind of thing?

17
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:06,310
Yeah, which there's three levels to that.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,790
Well, of course.

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,030
You could look at higher and lower as volume, right?

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,730
You know, higher volume, lower volume.

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,650
You could look at higher and lower as quality.

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,130
No, no, it's more advantage point here, more advantage point.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,970
Basically, the essence of the control system is higher and lower.

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,030
You know, the rich guy lives up in the tower.

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,470
The government's up in the tower.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,530
Powerful people up and you're down low, right?

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,690
The pyramid, right?

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,130
Top of the pyramid, bottom of the pyramid, right?

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,490
All that stuff.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,590
That is not pertinent to a sustainable thinking and a sustainable society.

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,870
That is only pertinent to a society that needs to be controlled and manipulated.

32
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,330
People do want to be manipulated.

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,910
They don't have to say it.

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,830
Absolutely, and high ground is useful in short-term strategies.

35
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,490
You know what I mean?

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,830
That's where the higher and lower is good.

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,870
It's in the short term.

38
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:06,050
But when it comes to what's more expansive, what is more inclusive, like what includes everything,

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,470
it's funny because we were looking back.

40
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,230
We do this thing looking back at the palindrome of the numbers, right?

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,890
We went and looked at eight because of 88, and I was thinking back to when I was early on the Internet

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,570
and 88 was some kind of, I forget what the reason for it was,

43
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,810
but it was some sort of symbol that had to do with Hitler, allegedly, right?

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,830
It was sort of like the thing you said in the chat room to let people know that you were a white supremacist.

45
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,490
And 88 is an interesting thing.

46
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,630
Well, it's good luck.

47
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,550
Yeah, it's good luck.

48
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,850
In the Asian culture, yeah.

49
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,790
You have the two infinity symbols kind of standing up, you know, that you can look at it that way.

50
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,650
What about the concept of infinity?

51
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,950
Is there such a thing?

52
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,430
Is it merely beyond our comprehension because everything to us is finite?

53
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:01,690
But there is no infinity if it's always—well, the concept of infinity has to be there

54
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,630
when you have a beginning and an end, right?

55
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,690
But most people, when you say infinity, it means no end,

56
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,190
but they never think that there was no beginning either, right?

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,710
Okay, I want to go back to what I was saying.

58
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,350
Yeah, sure.

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,910
What makes the Greek speak sustainable is understanding where you want to be in this reality, right?

60
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,990
I'll take a pause there for a second because that's a heavy statement.

61
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,950
Yeah, again, about vantage point too, right?

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:39,870
And the real vantage point, the only real thing for people that are free is to understand that it's inner and outer,

63
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,590
contractive and expansive.

64
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,250
That's it.

65
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,250
There is no higher or lower, this, that, or the other.

66
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,850
The more contractive you become, the more expansive you can become, right?

67
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,210
So more contractive would be extreme accuracy of knowledge and information,

68
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,350
extreme finite accuracy, precision and abundance.

69
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,130
That allows you to be very expansive, right?

70
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,730
So anyway, these are just concepts, but it's not higher or lower.

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,370
You know how to say higher knowledge and all that?

72
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,650
There is no higher and lower.

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,550
And when you get down to the brass tacks, like they say, it's inner knowledge, right?

74
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,850
The inner circle right there, right?

75
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,590
The secret, right?

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,550
They have it in the inner circles, right?

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,810
See, so it's never higher.

78
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,590
And look, the secret societies don't come out and say we have higher knowledge.

79
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,370
They have occult inner knowledge, right?

80
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,250
Inner knowledge, right.

81
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,610
Yeah, it's inner and outer.

82
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,470
So the more intense the inner, the more capable you could be on the outer.

83
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,570
If you so choose, if you so choose.

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,070
If you want to, I've been once called to be an ascetic.

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,730
Ascetic is someone like, you know, shuns opulence and wealth and all that.

86
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,190
I don't.

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,370
I just don't care about it because this is not the right place for that.

88
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,530
This is the right place and the right time for everything, right?

89
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:55,970
Right.

90
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,510
So merely people that are wealthy and show that they're wealthy are just wearing the

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,810
uniform of the wealthy.

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,950
And what I mean by that is, I don't know if you remember, there was a whole slew of articles.

93
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,330
This is an analogy.

94
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,730
Maybe about five, four, five, six years ago.

95
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,850
About how all these billionaire rappers or, you know, hundreds, actually all that stuff

96
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,950
is rented, their jewelry, their cars, their houses.

97
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,650
They really don't have any money at all, really.

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,410
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,430
Remember that?

100
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,170
It was a whole bunch, especially like 50 cent.

101
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,050
Yeah, that's been like a revelation a couple of times, right, where they showed that toward

102
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,690
the end of the 90s and then they showed it again, like you said, about 10 years ago,

103
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,870
I think now, where it was like, hey, remember those guys that, you know, had all their stuff

104
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,530
in their videos?

105
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,790
All that stuff was rented.

106
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,450
Nobody owns the yacht.

107
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,090
Nobody owns the limo.

108
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,870
Nobody owns the helicopter, etc.

109
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,410
Yeah.

110
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,830
So, OK, so let's say what if I had chosen.

111
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,790
OK, if you're going to be wealthy in this world, you would have to have a military,

112
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,310
your own military apparatus, which, by the way, it does exist.

113
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,550
There are certain wealthy people that if something goes on on their property around

114
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,790
them, they don't call the popo.

115
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,750
They don't call the police.

116
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,690
They have their own security.

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,810
They're not going to deal with you appropriately.

118
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,890
And they're allowed to do that.

119
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,190
But, yeah, you would have to build up in order to be wealthy.

120
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,510
OK, you must have a castle doctrine to look it up, whatever that is.

121
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,770
The king of your castle.

122
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,030
Right.

123
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,330
Right.

124
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,510
You know, like simple ways you have a moat, you know, and all that.

125
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,730
Right.

126
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,310
But, you know, it could be a digital one these days.

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,090
Sure.

128
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,710
So, yeah.

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,910
So I'm not for that.

130
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,050
But I do understand and have comprehension of the way things work enough that.

131
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,310
So I care to use them.

132
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,770
I know, you know how to do it.

133
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,610
So when you have.

134
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,270
The ability to go extremely young with information means you get anything and everything that

135
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,590
could be known about it with precision.

136
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,670
Then you can expand it, be extremely lean.

137
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,110
So the amount of expansion depends on the amount of contraction.

138
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,950
Right.

139
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,390
Like inhalation, exhalation.

140
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,250
Someone who's really good could do a really good inhale.

141
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,230
Could also, I bet, do a really good exhale.

142
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:12,550
Right.

143
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,750
Or a shallow breather will probably do neither.

144
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,690
So.

145
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,270
The masses have run down a program for a long time.

146
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,670
And you could see these programs, they bud every couple of hundred years, especially

147
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,650
now every decade.

148
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,370
Right.

149
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,610
But they're still running this big program, which leads me to.

150
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,330
I want to just, in a very contractive way, bring up what's been in the chat about how

151
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,290
to determine the moons.

152
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,490
It doesn't matter which moon it is, but, you know, which one of the, you know, is there

153
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,510
a 13 moon year?

154
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,350
There's there's many ways to go about it.

155
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,310
But the layman's approach, the one that I've been using that I settled on a long time ago

156
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,450
is the one that I find works best.

157
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,410
All right.

158
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,110
It's very simple.

159
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,610
And I've gone through this maybe a dozen times.

160
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,350
Actually, close your ears.

161
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll tell you, Chuck, I've gone over at least 100 times.

162
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,690
OK.

163
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,590
The easiest way is the first moon, number one, and the seventh moon, number seven, four,

164
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,630
five, six, seven are the largest moons in appearance when they are full.

165
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,690
And they are more on the cardinal than any of the others.

166
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,750
Both the first and the seventh, meaning they rise in the east and settle dead west.

167
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,470
Don't look at the sun at this point.

168
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,730
Sun will bounce around just the moons.

169
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,890
So let's say we come up right now.

170
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:35,730
We're in the 12th month.

171
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,070
We're coming up on the first month.

172
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,570
So when I look at the first month and it's also in retrospect.

173
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,950
So when I look at what I think is the next moon, which could either be the 13th or the

174
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,710
first, I look at how large it is when it's full, meaning the first time that it's full,

175
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:57,170
usually yellow near the horizon, and also look at how due east it is.

176
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,790
And when I go to site it, you know, the moon after the 12th, and it's not, it's more towards

177
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,950
the north, let's say.

178
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,030
It's not that big.

179
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,630
It's probably next month is the first.

180
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,330
It's really strange that way.

181
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,430
When I paid more attention to the intercalation, I was able to predict it a couple of three

182
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,410
months in advance.

183
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,270
But right now, I'm just going moon by moon.

184
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,570
The smallest moons, by the way, just for contrast, are the 9th, 10th months.

185
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,250
They're really tiny and they're, you know, far north, let's say.

186
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,090
And in the summer months, they don't get smaller because the atmosphere is thicker.

187
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,330
But by the way, the more atmosphere you have, the bigger the moon will look, right?

188
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,890
Because the atmosphere has a lensing effect.

189
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,890
That's why when you, when any object near the horizon looks much larger, not as crisp

190
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,410
and bright, but much larger.

191
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,830
So I remember flying in one of these, one of the last of the big airplanes, and it had

192
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,990
an upper deck, a little spiral staircase, and it had a moonroof in an airplane.

193
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,010
It was like a sunroof, moonroof type thing.

194
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,090
I remember seeing the moon and it was tiny.

195
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,670
I've never seen the moon so tiny ever.

196
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,810
And it was around the full moon period.

197
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,510
And I'm at 30,000, 35,000 feet.

198
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,910
So, you know, you think it should be bigger, right?

199
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,910
I would think so, yeah.

200
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:22,670
Yeah.

201
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,070
No, because there's less atmosphere.

202
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,930
So the higher you go, the smaller the moon looks.

203
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,270
The lower you go and the thicker the atmosphere, the larger the moon looks.

204
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,910
My favorite shots of the moon are like near the equator when it's full in the east and

205
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,930
the moon looks like it's huge.

206
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,490
And it really is perceptibly.

207
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,390
So I just brought that up just to consider what we're looking at is it's all perception.

208
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:56,470
But the easiest way to do it is when it rises due east and it's the largest size.

209
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,530
And by the way, let's say it's the 12th moon and the next moon we go to visualize.

210
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,790
You notice when I said the moon looked a little too far north, not due east.

211
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,410
So it'll probably be a 13th month.

212
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,430
Use that.

213
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,190
I lean on that more than the size of the moon, by the way.

214
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,050
A beginner will always think the full moon is usually the day after.

215
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,510
But it's not fully round either.

216
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,930
Yeah.

217
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,770
So I enjoy, I don't, I'm anti-cult.

218
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,590
As a matter of fact, this is called the unculting of humanity.

219
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,090
Do you know how simple and easy it would be to start a website dictating?

220
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,370
I'm saying dictating with a capital C.

221
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,570
All these things that I've been talking, Greek speak, making points and you better follow them.

222
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,190
Right.

223
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:41,990
You know what I mean?

224
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,350
You know how easy it would be to start a cult, you know, and push this.

225
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,030
And also when you look at, when you push any information, meaning you're forthright about it,

226
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,090
where do you get your authority from?

227
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,310
Right.

228
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,230
Other than the people.

229
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,750
I'm looking at, you know, is there, where do you get your badge?

230
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,010
Right.

231
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,510
So most of these things that I discuss should come from a quote unquote priestly class.

232
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,550
And I'm not a priest.

233
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,690
I've never been, I'm not from any lineage and I've never been adjudicated to be that.

234
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,470
I'm just some whatever that says these things because they feel like they have to.

235
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,570
And the reason I just said what I said is because you notice, like in the chat,

236
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,790
in other chats from previous through the decade, it's not more than a decade.

237
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,110
People are always, you know, comes around a moon, you know, deciding the moon.

238
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,350
I'd never chime in.

239
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,170
I never chime in and say, yeah, this is what it is.

240
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,210
You know, I don't know if you'd notice.

241
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,330
I never do that because, and I'm not looking for someone else to take the lead

242
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,010
because there's no leadership in this.

243
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,890
If you go back to castle doctrine, it's anarchism.

244
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,870
Meaning that word's been turned into something that it, you know,

245
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,750
like ground zero means it's an area where a nuke or an atomic device has been detonated.

246
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,830
There's nothing to do with what you think is the center of a place.

247
00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:01,730
So in a sense, when you bring up, oh, any subject at all,

248
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,410
I don't feel like I need to go forward on it.

249
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,590
And I'd like to see everyone else because that is the castle doctrine in anarchism.

250
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,890
Meaning in anarchy, anarchy means without a leader,

251
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,510
like archon or archos means leader or old, right?

252
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,050
Ana means without, not against, like a would be anti.

253
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,410
Ana means without.

254
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,230
So that means that everybody knows the law.

255
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,550
Everybody knows what to do.

256
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,970
Everybody does the right thing.

257
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,230
Everyone's educated, right?

258
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,410
This is a concept that is not for this age of people that have been bred.

259
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:42,030
They've been stock bred, corn fed, whatever, into this way of thinking at a young age.

260
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,910
I believe that it's possible that in the future, if not was so in the past at one point,

261
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,970
that just like animals, humans would have a pre-downloaded operating system.

262
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,590
Can you imagine where you would be born intelligent?

263
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,850
I have a hard time imagining that because of what I witnessed.

264
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,590
But no, it's fascinating to me because I have this conversation every so often

265
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,090
and it's a repetitious conversation about, well, you know,

266
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,030
if you believe in all that and you think that that's the way it should be,

267
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,070
you know, if we tried that right now, it wouldn't work.

268
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,590
And I go, of course it wouldn't.

269
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,970
The people are not prepared for this.

270
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,510
I think it's a lack of maturity.

271
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,350
Yeah, it's lack of preparation, right, because they don't know what to, right?

272
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,690
If tomorrow all the governments, all the organizations just evaporated,

273
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,150
all went away off the planet all at once, nobody would know what to do.

274
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,270
Well, actually they have.

275
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,550
There's three levels to everything, and right now it's been sliced up into three.

276
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,970
It's diluted three times.

277
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,630
Everything is diluted three times, whether it's religion.

278
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,870
That's why I like the statement, you know,

279
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,950
I like atheists because they're always non-profit, right?

280
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,610
So everything's been sliced up.

281
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,090
So when people say government, I can prove to you there is no more government as defined.

282
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:06,250
Now there are corporate entities that are bankrupt and in receivership to private trusts.

283
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,430
Oh, my gosh.

284
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,530
That's the threefold, right?

285
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,030
Three slices, right?

286
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,450
So then you look at religions, right?

287
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,130
Well, they're not based on the books that they're supposed to subscribe to

288
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,870
or they profess to subscribe to.

289
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,210
Are they based on also revived other ancient religions

290
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,030
that they're supposedly not supposed to be congruous with?

291
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,690
Yes.

292
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,310
Then there's a third other point.

293
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,270
Is it a form of control mechanism and separation?

294
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,770
Yes.

295
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,570
So everything has these three truths to it.

296
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,930
So try to imagine going with that.

297
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,510
By the way, I like the two strikes you're out, not the three strikes you're out.

298
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,370
Three strikes you're out, it's like too much wiggle room, right?

299
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,490
So if you do me wrong once, you get one more chance, not three, not two more chances, right?

300
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,850
So in other words, not just me.

301
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,870
I mean, this is just a philosophy, right?

302
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,030
In some cases, you can't do wrong at all,

303
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,230
and that would be more of an anarchistic society, right?

304
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,650
In other words, where you would have a high sense of discipline and a high sense of order.

305
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,870
So, yeah.

306
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,070
Yeah, but again, that would almost have to come, like you said,

307
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,590
factory installed, right, as part of the operating system already intact to begin with.

308
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,390
And I have a hard time even beginning to envision that with people because, again—

309
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,350
No, but hold on.

310
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,230
Just because you don't—

311
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,130
Okay, I have a hard time with it too, but notice I didn't say that.

312
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,130
It is possible.

313
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:41,050
If you remove anything that is impossible, then only the possible is most probable.

314
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,930
Only the possible is probable, right?

315
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,530
You see?

316
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,510
So is it impossible? No.

317
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,290
I didn't say whether you have a hard time with it or not, right?

318
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,770
Or anyone would have a hard time with it, even if they can't even grasp what we're talking about.

319
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,170
I suggest that it's possible and more than probable.

320
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,810
I believe there have been a time period, and there will be a time period,

321
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:10,650
where, you know, the analogy where a puppy newborn is adopted by a family of gorillas.

322
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,710
After it reaches adult doghood, you can adopt that puppy or dog now,

323
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,410
and you wouldn't know it was raised by gorillas.

324
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,050
It would, you know, chase a squirrel and bark and chase a stick

325
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,290
and pee just like a regular dog that wasn't raised by gorillas.

326
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,550
But if you had a human raised by gorillas, and as an adult you brought them home,

327
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,530
the first thing you do is jump up on your kitchen table and throw poop.

328
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,630
Right?

329
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,270
So, I'm not joking, that's what they do for, anyway, for domination.

330
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,610
So, this is, yeah.

331
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,810
So that's the, you see, the download.

332
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,910
The dog has the download and humans don't.

333
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,450
I believe that it's a necessity.

334
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,290
In other words, to escape the pitfalls of what you see in history

335
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,310
and what we see outside your door or in your family or wherever you see it.

336
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,290
It's a necessity.

337
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,250
And because it's a necessity, it will come.

338
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,390
You know, the universe always brings all necessities, always.

339
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,370
You know, meaning the construct that we're in, you know.

340
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,770
So, again, speaking of the construct, the dreaming thing has been coming up,

341
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,690
and I wanted to do more in depth.

342
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,550
We're not going to go in depth now.

343
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,270
Maybe I'll just make some quick statements.

344
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,730
I'd also refer to the Michio Kushi video that I posted in the chat.

345
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,510
The name of the video, I think I mentioned, is Spiritual Nature.

346
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,510
Actually, I should try to bring it up again.

347
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,070
But it's basically, the reason I brought it up is because he's a master teacher.

348
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,110
When he starts off the video, he shows how we're inside out plants,

349
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,190
how plants and humans are in common.

350
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,270
And I've always talked about how we're upside-down plants, right?

351
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,830
The root ball being the brain, the limbs are the limbs,

352
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,910
and the fruit or the flower is the sexual organ, right?

353
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,730
So we're basically in an upside-down stance.

354
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,290
If you take it further, because we also have the analog of a plant,

355
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,290
animals do as well, but they're at 90 degrees versus us, right?

356
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,570
They're horizontal. We're vertical.

357
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,030
They also have the analog or the archetype.

358
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,670
We also dream because of the plant nature in us.

359
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,530
And I'll give you an example.

360
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,830
You know how you can go up to a plant and cut a twig off and prune it?

361
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,410
I garden, so I'd break off various greens if I don't want to deroot,

362
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,510
pull the whole plant out, right?

363
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,870
The plant actually thrives in many cases when you prune it, right?

364
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,130
Well, some people cut the flowers off, you know, different things.

365
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,650
Sure, why not?

366
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,290
Sure, and pruning is a necessity in a lot of the more domesticated agriculture.

367
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,990
You know, anyway.

368
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,090
Well, imagine you're in a dream and, you know,

369
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,570
someone comes up and cuts your arm off.

370
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,230
You're like, oh, why'd you cut my arm off?

371
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,870
Well, it's just a dream, see?

372
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,730
So we borrow that dream archetype from plants also,

373
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,030
and I'm being kind of affirmative about it.

374
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,230
Then when we move forward, okay,

375
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,890
skip a big juncture that we might get into in the future.

376
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,970
Now we dream when we talk about dreams and what are they and all that, right?

377
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,150
Well, we're anchored in that plant architecture

378
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,170
because, see, a plant is always in a dreamscape.

379
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,210
By the way, most of you are hallucinogenics,

380
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,770
and, you know, actually all of them were derived from what?

381
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,530
Plants, right?

382
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,050
Duh, right?

383
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,790
Of course, because you see the energy transfer through that dream world, right?

384
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,850
So we dream, and I believe that I'm affirmative on this,

385
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,750
that it goes back to the nature of plants,

386
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,310
that we are upside-down plants,

387
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,910
and we are contemplative beings,

388
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,950
and also the difference of a plant's intensity

389
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,670
to be a dreamer and a human's intensity is much more

390
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,070
because a plant can't move when there's danger, can it?

391
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,130
Not that easily.

392
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,470
Right?

393
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,250
Well, we can.

394
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,070
We don't need to suffer certain things,

395
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,590
and we literally biolocate, you know, move our biology somewhere else, right?

396
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,010
But we still have these dreams,

397
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,110
and these dreams now, because we have the ability to dream and do dreams,

398
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,450
some people don't, by the way, which I commend you,

399
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,990
and I don't, I've only been dreaming recently

400
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,170
because I've been going into other worlds

401
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,470
and trying to go back into this world with things that I'm doing,

402
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,490
this world meaning the collective,

403
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,950
entertaining it, I should say.

404
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,430
Parts of me are entertaining it.

405
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,050
But because, see, the plant is in a much more intense situation,

406
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,330
again, because it can't move, but we can move.

407
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,430
So we have to balance out our ability to not want to suffer certain things

408
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,570
by moving our location, you know,

409
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,610
whether it means getting up from your chair and walking three steps

410
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,310
or running or going to the other side of the world.

411
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,630
We have to blend that with the ability to dream also, you see?

412
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,250
So this is a big concept which I'm still investigating,

413
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,430
but the dream that we're in right now, what we call reality,

414
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,310
is still a dream. Why?

415
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,210
Because we still depend on plants.

416
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,190
So at one point, will we no longer depend on plants?

417
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,030
The dream question will be answered.

418
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,050
Dogs and cats appear to dream as well.

419
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,290
I mean, you know, I'm not inside of their heads,

420
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,310
so I don't know exactly,

421
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,230
but it appears to be that when they're sleeping,

422
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,670
they're having experiences, they're reactive, right,

423
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,250
to things that are seemingly incongruous with what's going on around them,

424
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,090
which I interpret as them dreaming.

425
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,270
Sure, sure, they do. Well, they depend on plants as well.

426
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,950
Everything here depends on plants.

427
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,310
If eating another animal, right?

428
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,390
As a matter of fact, we go back, you know,

429
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,250
you know the term pushing up daisies, right?

430
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:56,930
Right, right.

431
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,150
Yeah, so, yeah, it's all plant-dependent.

432
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,930
And when we do not,

433
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,110
the only way we will be able to really figure out dreams

434
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,890
in a succinct, objective way

435
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,110
is when we no longer are in an environment

436
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,210
that requires any dependency on plants.

437
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,050
It's just an interesting idea, and I'm working on more on it,

438
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,790
and I think it'll be a pretty good presentation.

439
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,350
Well, another thing to work into that when you do it

440
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,750
is the cycle, right?

441
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:30,270
Because eventually the decayed or the remains of the animals

442
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,070
go back into the earth and do what?

443
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,370
Create plants also.

444
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,310
Not necessarily, though.

445
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,110
If you are in the desert, by the way,

446
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,990
if there are no plants present,

447
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,490
you know, if you buried someone in the Sahara Desert 400 years ago,

448
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,210
you dig them out, they look like they were only dead for two months, right?

449
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,670
They would not decay at all.

450
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,910
Very little, because of the dry.

451
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,510
But if there are plants in the area,

452
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,250
they will decay and go back to the earth.

453
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,470
Well, this goes back to where the body belongs to the earth,

454
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,470
but the plants are sort of like the archetype also,

455
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,370
you know, the secondary.

456
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,290
Once you were conceived,

457
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,450
if your mom did not intake earth elements,

458
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,830
you would not be formed.

459
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,170
And then once you're done here,

460
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,650
you go back to earth elements.

461
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,910
So the physical body, this is a very...

462
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,870
I'm trying to abandon the notion

463
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,350
that we solely depend on the, you know,

464
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,610
this body solely depends on the earth,

465
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,550
which it really does,

466
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,830
and just go into the dream side.

467
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,390
But when you hit that,

468
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,630
the dependency on plants prevents to go any further,

469
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,490
you see, until we do.

470
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,730
Yeah, that's why I was going to ask.

471
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,370
The next thing is, what about the fungus,

472
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,510
the spores, the mushrooms, right?

473
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,590
Those are not plants.

474
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,270
The fungus is not an animal, it's not a plant.

475
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,330
They don't know what it is.

476
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,530
Yeah, that's why I was going to ask you where that fits,

477
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,490
because it seems to me as though, again,

478
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,110
it's part of both things, right?

479
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,150
I was thinking about the decay in the desert.

480
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,930
Sometimes you find a lot of fungus

481
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,610
and things like that which will grow,

482
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,930
and it does end up decaying.

483
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,850
Well, a yeast, a proper yeast, a high-grade yeast,

484
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,010
will go into crystalline form for thousands of years

485
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,070
and then come back out of that crystalline form, right?

486
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,250
So crystal is the most stable structure.

487
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,870
No, right, but I'm just saying energetically, though,

488
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,150
at some point in the cycle, again,

489
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,530
fungus, spores, these kinds of things also have to be in there,

490
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,530
and they are separate from the plant or the animal,

491
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,190
and yet they're ingested by both,

492
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,190
and they are produced by both, it seems like to me.

493
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,850
Oh, right, your body produces fungus.

494
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,790
Your body produces everything,

495
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,210
even uranium in the cells, yeah.

496
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,970
Right, well, through induction.

497
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,310
Yeah, exactly.

498
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,270
Again, induction, again, we're not free enough.

499
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,490
We have not freed ourselves enough.

500
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,450
By the way, Greek-speak is what it is.

501
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,110
It's a chisel and a hammer, right,

502
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,650
to break away all this stuff that we're not free from.

503
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,910
I'm not saying it's revolutionary,

504
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,930
because, by the way,

505
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,850
revolution is always done by the same people.

506
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,030
Whenever you hear revolution, you go dig deep enough,

507
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,330
and you see it's this new boss, same as the old boss.

508
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,890
The real revolution, the real change is to not participate,

509
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,090
but not drop out.

510
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,430
Just don't endorse what you see going on around you, right?

511
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,810
You could still use it, but use it conditionally, right?

512
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,130
So the whole thing with Greek-speak

513
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,630
is to let's just get to not necessarily the bottom of it,

514
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,270
but get to what it can be in good form,

515
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,570
in its best form.

516
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,590
How can it be explained?

517
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,470
Well, it seems to me that people that claim to seek revolution

518
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,490
really are in search of evolution.

519
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,250
They do seek to become better

520
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,030
and to increase their quality themselves, right,

521
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,690
the quality of their life, the quality of the things around them.

522
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,190
So it seems to me as though they wish to evolve

523
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,610
is more of an accurate description as opposed to...

524
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,150
Yeah, evolve more than...

525
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,130
Yeah, revolve, revolution is to go around the circle.

526
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,010
You know, there's a famous political circle.

527
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,750
Yeah, there's your hit, revolve.

528
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,130
What do you do when you revolve?

529
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,330
You never want to partake in any revolution at all,

530
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,150
because it's a scam.

531
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,230
All the revolutions have been scams.

532
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,830
The only way to really create change

533
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,090
is stop using the things that harm you.

534
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,930
Oh, what a simple concept, right?

535
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,510
Yeah.

536
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,830
And only use the things that benefit you and others.

537
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:36,910
Very simple.

538
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,970
So, getting to the nuts and bolts of it.

539
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,370
Yeah.

540
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,650
I could just rehash a conversation I had about the pandemic

541
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,510
with some people, professional people,

542
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,730
and their mouths were hanging open

543
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,070
on how simple it is to debunk something.

544
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,730
And I think I've gone through that before,

545
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,650
so it's not necessary.

546
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,990
But again, it seems like they were in a dream state

547
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,550
and still are, as we all are.

548
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,490
And the common expression, right,

549
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,830
is, you know, are you awake?

550
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,630
Are you aware?

551
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,850
You know, it is a lot about dreaming,

552
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,990
and it's funny because...

553
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,430
Hold on.

554
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,790
When you awake from one dream,

555
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,510
you're waking into another dream now.

556
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,230
That's because we're still tied into it, you see.

557
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,490
I find that to be one of the most annoying experiences,

558
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,110
by the way,

559
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,310
is you think you woke up when you're in a dream state

560
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,390
and you haven't come back to, you know,

561
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,670
what I understand as conscious, right?

562
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,770
And you almost get tricked for a moment.

563
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,290
Did I wake up or did I not?

564
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,630
Sometimes it's difficult to tell.
