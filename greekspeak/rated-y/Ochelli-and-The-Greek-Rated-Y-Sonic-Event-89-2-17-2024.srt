1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,880
Rated Y, Sonic, let's see now, 89, because it was 88 last time, right?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,040
I think so, I'm losing track on occasion.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,940
Anyway, it doesn't matter, Otelli in the Greek Rated Y, here we are, and how are you doing

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,360
tonight, Greek?

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,720
Oh, napping as usual, yeah, falling asleep on the job.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,560
That's okay, hey, whatever job you're on, sometimes it's good to fall asleep.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,200
I hear that little bit of nasally that leads me to believe that you were probably just

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,160
breathing deeply a short time ago.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,340
Actually, I was welding today, and if you're not used to it, you're not used to it, right?

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,780
But when you weld, you're creating plasma and you're evaporating metal, so you're literally

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,040
breathing metal gas, not gases, but the actual plasma itself, so it's fine.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,400
It was stick welding, you know, the basic stuff, but I didn't have enough ventilation,

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:57,760
so.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,080
Yeah, so you said you wanted to start off with, maybe you've got a question or something.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,900
Yeah, definitely.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,400
Well, there's been a bunch of suggestions and generalized questions recently in chats

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,900
and private messages, one sent on Skype, one sent through Facebook, let's see, emails,

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,440
you know, all that, kind of coming together, generally asking about something, so I figured

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,140
let's just step back on something and talk about it in a slightly different way.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,660
Parables, in and of themselves, right?

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,440
Generally speaking, storytelling, moral lesson, doesn't matter if you believe that it's a

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,520
work of fiction or not.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,700
Like, I enjoy Star Trek and I've been, you know, checking out some of those things a

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,400
little more lately.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,840
When it is I want to, you know, do something that is not necessarily productive and I want

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
to relax, I like Star Trek.

27
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,720
But anyway, always there's a moral lesson in there of some kind, and it's not always

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,080
necessarily a moral lesson.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,380
It might be about society.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,360
It's some sort of exposition meant to give you an idea through a parable.

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,460
And I would say that no matter what it is you think of the biblical text or the various

32
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,240
versions of it or the translations, on and on and on, one thing that I think is always

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,280
supposed to be retained and is retained in it is the parables.

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,660
There is a constant.

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,600
I don't get into them that much because they're so clear, even though they're parables.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,720
That's the irony of it.

37
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,500
And the stuff that people think is clear is not.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Parables are great because you could find them in every culture, right?

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,220
Well, and you can you get more than one thing out of the parable, too.

40
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,340
You know, like different versions of it.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,940
Well, they operate on multiple levels, you could say.

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,500
Okay.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,060
That's what I was reaching for, though, because you or I could hear it or, you know, read

44
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,000
it and take it one way or a couple of ways, and then we could hand it to someone else

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,880
and they might derive a completely different lesson.

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,560
They might draw a completely different inference.

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,020
Most people won't get anything out of it, believe it or not.

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,940
Otherwise, they would be more venerated, right?

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,240
Well, I don't know how that works, because honestly, I'm always looking for the other

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,340
message, you know, the subtext.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,700
Some people would say I'm always looking for the subtext, you know, the stuff that's

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,940
not being told to me directly, necessarily.

53
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,100
But forget about me.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,060
In general, I think people, whether they're aware of it or not, should be picking up on

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,760
some other lesson, even if it's the wrong lesson.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,440
They're picking up something from it.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Well, in short, it's like calling it the philosophy that you find in the biblical text,

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,500
because a lot of it is not.

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,740
It's pretty much telling certain people what to do, like what you call law.

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,780
So there's a philosophy side of it, right?

61
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,800
And there's usually a pun in a lesson, right?

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,280
And there's usually a follow through.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,120
Like, you know, a good comedian, by the way, he spends the difference between a good comedian

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,100
and a bad comedian is a good comedian will draw out a joke much longer than a not so

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
good comedian will do short jokes.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,420
Right.

67
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,540
They'll draw out the punch line really, really far.

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:17,959
Right.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,400
So in other words, if you're good at holding an audience, you can stretch something out

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,760
and they'll still appreciate it.

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,240
Right.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
And still keep their interest.

73
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,160
Right.

74
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,520
Like, I love Chappelle because he'll turn around, he'll begin with a premise and go

75
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,080
through a bunch of other things that aren't exactly dead on, clearly connected to one

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,160
another, come back around and hit that punch line a half hour later.

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,700
Right.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,700
After he's already and repeatedly, you could use the same theme on multiple jokes.

79
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,580
But the reason I'm bringing up comedy is because you're addressing a group of people that are

80
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,240
hearing stuff for the first time usually.

81
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,520
Right.

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,340
Because, you know, most comedians, when they go on a circuit, they do they repeat their

83
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,640
show.

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:02,900
Right.

85
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,700
Slight variation, basically the whole whether you see Chappelle in Vegas or New York or

86
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,620
Chicago, he's pretty much doing the same skit.

87
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:09,840
Right.

88
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,120
Majority of stand up operate that way.

89
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,360
Yes.

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,220
Yeah.

91
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,460
So there's something parallel to the biblical because the rest of it would be very strict

92
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,620
law to those that are in covenant.

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,500
So the parables would be for both.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,660
You see, it's more inclusive.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,080
OK.

96
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,560
See, what I find interesting about this, though, is that it's it's a direct relation

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,260
to because where do people often get their best lessons out of these things, even in

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,560
the organized church, which I find almost no use for whatsoever?

99
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,940
It does have, you know, a bit of relevance in a community sometimes where they.

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah.

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
But I'm going to stop you there because people don't learn.

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,980
They follow their culture.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,720
In other words, whatever culture you live in and whatever is accepted or not accepted up

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,780
until adolescence is what you've learned.

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,140
The rest of it is just, you know, frilled.

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,800
They don't look.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,420
So it's more positive because about being blunt and to the point, how many people actually

108
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,340
use what's in the parables?

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,420
They cite it as cliche, but I don't know anyone who really uses it.

110
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,280
Hardly anybody.

111
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,460
But yeah, so it's an entertainment gimmick for them.

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,060
Well, entertainment, but even entertainment in and of itself is is reinforcement of a

113
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
cultural idea one way or another.

114
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,400
Right.

115
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,080
Well, the culture, again, is independent because it's geographic and it's familial or

116
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
tribal, right?

117
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,320
You could have a big tribe, right?

118
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
Like Sunnis and Shias, right?

119
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,620
Or whatever.

120
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah, it's interesting to see what's in the parables from many points of view.

121
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,760
And that's how I always viewed it, because a lot of it you'll find in other languages,

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,260
in other cultures that are not biblical, which shows that there was a worldwide economy

123
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,160
at the time, right?

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,240
Just like the, you know, the the imperial inch in the yard is right is pretty much.

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,220
And there was another measurement, not mile.

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,280
It's it's longer than a mile.

127
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,040
Hectors and all these things.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,360
These things were universal economic.

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,540
You know, when I say economics, the word economics means the laws of the house.

130
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,160
Right.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,700
Nomics means law and echo means house.

132
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,180
And when you get ecosystem, you're literally saying a house system.

133
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,200
You're a boat, right?

134
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,420
So economic, what I mean by that is a set of standards that people use.

135
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,280
If you really want to find some interesting parables, it's really hard to find them online

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,660
now.

137
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,040
But I was looking at this subject more than a more than 15 years ago, say the early 2000s

138
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,640
is a lot of the Persian ones.

139
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,860
And I remember some of them, you know, brought some up maybe in private calls or other calls

140
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,820
about or other sonics about the poison water and the warnings of all kinds of things.

141
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,400
But if you look at the parables, you could say they're fairly cynical, by the way.

142
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,820
Right.

143
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,000
Most of them are in a negative attribute in a cynical attribute.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,060
The majority of them are certainly cautionary, and it doesn't matter if you're talking about

145
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,380
the biblical texts or Aesop's fables, right?

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah, but cautionary could be pretty harsh also.

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, yeah.

148
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,780
Well, I mean, you think about the one where the whatever it is gives a ride to the scorpion,

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,780
you know, help me get across the water and the scorpion stings him anyway, the scorpion

150
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,740
and the fox or whatever.

151
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:30,960
Yeah.

152
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,740
You know, it's pretty harsh because the animal dies that you're, you know, engaged in in

153
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,260
the story.

154
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:36,880
Yeah.

155
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,559
The biblical parables don't lean on that that much.

156
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,500
They do a little bit like, you know, the dead don't worship the Lord.

157
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,600
You know, if you read the King James and things like that.

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Oh, you think about a lot getting away from, you know, Sodom and Gomorrah and.

159
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,200
That's not a that's not that would be more of the Genesis, the beginning of the tribe,

160
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,700
let's say.

161
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,380
But, yeah, the parables, I would say that it's the wisdom writings.

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,020
It's kind of hard when you say parables.

163
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,920
Really, you're leaning more on the New Testament.

164
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
That's where you'll find the parables.

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,360
The rest of it, you'll find statements that lean on something.

166
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,120
But the wisdom writings of Solomon and then the parables are the ones that Christ use,

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
which are allegories.

168
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,180
But but they're very much broad.

169
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,380
Here's the thing.

170
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,700
The reason why the biblical biblical text is not known is because it's being used by

171
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,480
certain groups of people to run the majority of the groups of people.

172
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,440
And I got into it because early on.

173
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,680
Well, in the 2002, someone was talking about all law comes from the Bible, Western cultures.

174
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

175
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
You know, even if it's not, you know, banking, whatever.

176
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,020
Yeah.

177
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,880
The common statement is that everything in the Western world, the 72 hour writer refused

178
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,580
all that stuff.

179
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,940
And I was like, oh, how could that be?

180
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,100
I never heard of that.

181
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
So I went and studied it just based on the laws.

182
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,520
Right.

183
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,360
So you'd find that in Exodus, Leviticus mostly.

184
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,980
Some numbers in Deuteronomy.

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,540
Side note law.

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,660
And I was studying that.

187
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,620
How come no one ever talks about these things?

188
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,860
Right.

189
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,480
And then when you went out talking about them, you found out why.

190
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,280
Because it is they are.

191
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,060
You could see that they're the underpinning of the Western jurisprudence.

192
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,060
But they want to hide that from people.

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,440
Right.

194
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,720
So the people, all they have left because they're told to stay away from that is to

195
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,260
go look at parables.

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,920
That's mostly in the New Testament with the parables of the Christ, let's say.

197
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,360
And then there's the wisdom writings which have parables in them.

198
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:55,260
But I would say that if you don't have the footing that the biblical text is to lay down

199
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,740
civil jurisprudence.

200
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,140
Right.

201
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,700
OK.

202
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,260
Because Islam also, right, the you're going to you're not going to get much out of it

203
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,560
because there's a famous thing about the woman being ready to be stoned.

204
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,060
And the Christ says he without whoever is without sin.

205
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,360
Right.

206
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,660
Yeah.

207
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,920
Everyone takes that wrong because they don't know the specifics of the law.

208
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,180
Just to restate it, it's if you have outstanding.

209
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,960
OK, if you have outstanding parking tickets or a warrant or whatever, you can't be a witness.

210
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,240
Right.

211
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,320
I think the same thing is here.

212
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,680
Well, not really.

213
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,860
But so so how can they say they're going to stoner if they don't have a witness?

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,120
Right.

215
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
A viable witness.

216
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,780
So what I'm trying to say is biblical law is very harsh.

217
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,300
People just think, oh, we don't do that anymore.

218
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,580
But actually, it's much easier because if everyone who witnessed a particular crime

219
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,380
has outstanding parking tickets or warrants, they are not a viable witness.

220
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,780
So you actually walk.

221
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,320
So even even if you murdered someone in front of 20 people and those 20 people were going

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,880
to perform the positions, the social position of a witness for that case, and they were

223
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,660
they have to be examined prior.

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,940
And if they have, again, outstanding parking tickets or warrants, their testimony doesn't

225
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,360
count.

226
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:22,800
Yeah.

227
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,840
But that almost sounds like all I got to do is get a room full of shoplifters and I can

228
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,380
murder a family in front of them.

229
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,760
And yeah, pretty much.

230
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,280
That's how that's that's so no matter how harsh biblical law looks, those things need

231
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,740
to be met now.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,920
So you will not suffer that.

233
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,300
Right.

234
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,260
So this is the whole thing.

235
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,740
So most people who don't know the law will say, oh, he's saying that out of the goodness

236
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,340
of his heart.

237
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,960
So forgiving.

238
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,940
No, no.

239
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,960
Because the whole thing is about his whole thing was reiterating do you know, doing the

240
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
law of Moses.

241
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:55,900
Right.

242
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,100
So that's what, you know, referred to in common colloquial, the law of Moses.

243
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,240
Well, don't they also have to be competent to be a witness?

244
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,860
Like, right.

245
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,160
They have.

246
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,940
Well, yes.

247
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,600
Well, the way the word competent doesn't necessarily mean it means many things.

248
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:11,900
Right.

249
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,940
So in this case, they would not be competent.

250
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,120
No, no.

251
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,160
In this case, they wouldn't be.

252
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,140
What I'm saying is, though, to get a legitimate witness, isn't there some measure of competency

253
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,500
to where?

254
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,040
Yes.

255
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,080
Yeah, it would be if you have outstanding.

256
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,320
In other words, competency, meaning do you qualify from a qualitative point of view,

257
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,020
not a quantity.

258
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,100
So if you had a thousand people witness, you murder someone and all of them have outstanding

259
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,860
parking tickets or warrants and warrants or warrants.

260
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,180
None of them are competent.

261
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,360
The competent now means something different means like mental competent, but competent

262
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,500
also means you can't you don't have standing.

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:46,960
Right.

264
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,740
It's not just mental ability.

265
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,080
That's how we're using it now.

266
00:13:51,180 --> 00:14:00,840
Because if you read, for example, old constitutional law, the the for example, the common law can

267
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,380
only be applied where it was competent to do so.

268
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,660
So if you waive common law because you have some private contract and they're coming after

269
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,700
you because the common law says you have a right to private contract without interference.

270
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,480
So if there is someone that you have a private contract with is coming after you after some

271
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,300
bizarre performance issue that you didn't upkeep, the common law is not competent in

272
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,860
that case.

273
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,200
Right.

274
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,380
Right.

275
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,160
So when I say competent, meaning they cannot withstand as as a witness.

276
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,100
So most people here, that's you could take that as a parable, take that as a fiction

277
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,420
or whatever.

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,580
But if you don't have an understanding of the law, you will never see what's going on

279
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,820
there.

280
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,840
Now, I wasn't there.

281
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,360
And it doesn't say that he said whoever is without sin throw the first stone because

282
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,940
of the law.

283
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,580
He didn't say so.

284
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,420
Someone could take a strict interpretation of the other way, saying, well, he said that

285
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,620
because he's benevolent.

286
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,720
Right.

287
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,240
OK, so you be the judge.

288
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,720
In other words, again, it's open, but I'm telling you, it's not open because it's

289
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,480
reiterated over and over and over about doing the law of Moses.

290
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,800
Right.

291
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,360
And when he says, like, sin no more and all this other stuff also is with the law of Moses.

292
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,760
Right.

293
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,940
Because the payment is high and also the writing on the dirt.

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,400
You know, if someone is accused without a witness of adultery, the law is written and

295
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,860
dust from the temple flaws put into a cup and water and she drinks it.

296
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,640
And if she loses, it's like magic.

297
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,120
If she loses the use of her leg or legs, she's guilty.

298
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,960
If she can walk freely after she drinks that potion, she's not guilty.

299
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,280
So you see, so he's writing on the dust.

300
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,900
So if you understand the law, but when someone jumps, OK, let's be frank.

301
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,020
If you just jump around and saying, I like this or like that about the Bible or want

302
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,360
to know about this or about that, and you start making it fractional, you're never

303
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,400
going to you can see it in multiple different ways, which it's not even a diamond that has

304
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,100
many facets.

305
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,340
It's still a holistic piece.

306
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,640
Right.

307
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,220
It's a diamond.

308
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,540
Right.

309
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,900
OK, so the what makes what gives the the hardness to the Bible is that it is a law book.

310
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,660
All right.

311
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,140
First, and it shows you history.

312
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,200
It shows you law of those that agree to follow those laws and then temporal things.

313
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,880
And of course, the parables.

314
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,060
But for people that are interested in the parables, I think they without law, they would

315
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,760
get just as much out of philosophy.

316
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,960
And if I see that most of the stuff written in the Bible to those that are not in the

317
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,180
covenant, it's very cynical towards them.

318
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,480
Right.

319
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,740
So if you going to be towards cynicism, I would go and read Diogenes.

320
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,020
You'll get more out of that.

321
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,480
Actually, if you lean towards Greece, Greek speak, there's plenty of YouTube's you could

322
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,440
put in Diogenes, Greek philosopher.

323
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,280
And if you like Greek speak, you'll like Diogenes, you know, like Alexander the Great

324
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,440
went to Diogenes.

325
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,140
Diogenes was he was a cynic, but it goes it goes a long way.

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,819
OK, Alexander the Great came to him, as it goes, I'm paraphrasing and says, you know,

327
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,859
I'm Alexander the Great.

328
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,760
We came to Diogenes while Diogenes was signing near a tree in the afternoon.

329
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,160
And Diogenes, as Alexander said to Diogenes, you know, I'm Alexander.

330
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,760
I could grant you anything you wish.

331
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,440
So what would you wish?

332
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,300
And Diogenes says, yeah, just move over a little bit.

333
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
You're blocking the sun.

334
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,780
Right.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,280
And then another time he came to Diogenes and he says, well, do you fear me?

336
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,260
And he says, well, men, well, it depends if you're good or evil.

337
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,420
If you're good, I have no reason to fear you.

338
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,740
Right.

339
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,060
Right.

340
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,960
He would stand outside of a whorehouse and yell while it was busy.

341
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,200
Prostitutes are like poison and honey.

342
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,320
Prostitutes are like poison and honey and disturb everyone in there.

343
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,380
So they would throw money at him to go away because he was known to be a beggar.

344
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,760
So when he collected enough coins, he went in and he joined.

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,560
He had enough money now to go inside the brothel himself, you see.

346
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:09,920
OK.

347
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,060
Right.

348
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,340
So he was quite interesting.

349
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,020
I like him.

350
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,920
One of his quotes is poverty is the only thing money can't buy.

351
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,340
OK.

352
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,680
I see.

353
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,980
So we have a level of irony here.

354
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,060
A comedian of his day, sort of.

355
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,720
Well, he was a cynic.

356
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,540
I mean, he did some foul things and he lived in a large ceramic cask.

357
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,380
Imagine a hundred gallon wine flask, you know, wine vessel.

358
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,880
OK.

359
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,820
You know, it'd be three feet wide, four feet tall.

360
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,480
He lived in one of those.

361
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,920
He would go into the town, into the Agora, which is the main market

362
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,500
at noon with a lantern fully lit at noon and shine at people's face.

363
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,180
And he says, what are you doing?

364
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,000
And he says, I'm looking for an honest man.

365
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,560
Yeah, he's pretty.

366
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,560
So if you're if you're down with Greek speak, check out Diogenes.

367
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,240
Some of the stuff is really harsh.

368
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,320
I wouldn't approve of defecating or masturbating in public.

369
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,680
Right.

370
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,340
Just to show people whatever.

371
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,620
And people call him, they call him a dog that spit in his face and all that.

372
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,580
Right.

373
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
Because he was a cynic.

374
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,460
But he says, what are you calling me a dog?

375
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,320
You think it's bad, but a dog is a good thing.

376
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,620
A dog, when he wants something, he barks at you.

377
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,120
And when and when you give him something, he, you know, wags his tail and licks you.

378
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
And he also bites the scoundrels.

379
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,800
So dog calling is actually dog has actually good qualities.

380
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,740
Yeah.

381
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,920
Dog will bite the people that are there to hurt you.

382
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,200
That's, you know, so anyway.

383
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,140
Yeah.

384
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,060
I would suggest the cynicism going along with the Greek speak, because very often I get into

385
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,020
a subject and to add levity to, you know, the three F's when you promote something or say

386
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,380
something.

387
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,040
Three F's are first one should have facts.

388
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,880
It should have feeling.

389
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,680
It should have fun.

390
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,380
So when I give some facts, I try to get the feeling of the person.

391
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,600
Let's talk about the money system.

392
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,960
I try to say something with fun, but so usually very cynic.

393
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,880
It's like, have you been on this planet for more than a week?

394
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,620
You should know this.

395
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,080
And someone heard me say this to someone new and they were like, oh, he says that to everyone

396
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,060
because, you know, the person was cautious that I might offend someone.

397
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,840
I said, no, I don't.

398
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,680
Person's person's not offended at all.

399
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,260
They just most of them laugh.

400
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,640
But in a nervous laugh when you, you know, if someone's showing you something that should

401
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,720
be well known, but it's not well known and they ask you, have you been on this planet

402
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,340
more than a week?

403
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
First of all, nobody says stuff like that.

404
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,620
I've never heard anyone say that.

405
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,460
And the other thing is, would you feel threatened?

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
Do you feel insulted?

407
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,460
Occasionally out of context, I'll say, what are you new here?

408
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,720
You know, in a situation which is kind of the same thing in a different way, but I can

409
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,280
use that in different situations, you know, not necessarily something.

410
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,260
But, you know, so there's many levels to it, but I've never some some people do get

411
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,660
insulted with the religious stuff.

412
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm like, you know, basically, if I meet a Catholic, I mean, you're basically into

413
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,740
down with Satanism.

414
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm not into they saw you just insulted me.

415
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,000
Right.

416
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,240
So, yeah, by the way, it is 100 percent.

417
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,800
That's, you know, anyway, you know, the politics signal each other by going to that

418
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,940
they're Catholic has nothing to do with being Catholic.

419
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,160
It's a signal, you know, public signal like in the men in black, you know, Catholicism

420
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,920
is satanic, among other things.

421
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,320
It's a huge composite.

422
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,040
It's adversarial.

423
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,380
Ton of things.

424
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,720
So, yeah, sure, sure.

425
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,080
But as somebody who is, you know, sort of the goes to church every Sunday, make sure

426
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,180
to put something in the plate.

427
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,040
And, you know, we'll quote that stuff any time there's any sort of controversy ever.

428
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,280
That guy gets offended at it because how dare you?

429
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,660
You know.

430
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,020
Yeah.

431
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,660
Well, that's why I say the atheists are the real nonprofits.

432
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,080
You'll never see an atheist megachurch.

433
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,180
And there's multiple meanings there, too.

434
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,160
They're nonprofits and they can't possibly be prophets because they don't believe in

435
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,540
prophecy.

436
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,020
So that's right.

437
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,980
So either way, there's secularists.

438
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,220
But they've always been atheists, by the way, always.

439
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,420
So, all right.

440
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
So so back to how we started on this, I I don't.

441
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,060
Hmm.

442
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,640
Let's just be forthright.

443
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,960
I the interests that I put forward, say, to be specific regarding what they call Scripture,

444
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,000
the Bible, whatever, are my own.

445
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,400
And the only reason I put my own interests out is because I find that when you strip

446
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,880
everything down about anything, especially the Bible, you can ask, what's its purpose?

447
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,320
What what's written in it?

448
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,500
And do we know it when we when we when we say we should?

449
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,560
And the answer to that is, no, no one seems to know what's in it.

450
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:38,800
Right.

451
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,060
Even the worst ones are the ones that go to church or seminary or whatever.

452
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,620
So, yeah.

453
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,100
So just like a lawyer, lawyers don't know anything about law.

454
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,740
They don't.

455
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,820
They know a little bit.

456
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,020
This is go look at a small community college teaches law like Harvard or Yale, right?

457
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,260
A minor college and look at their curriculum.

458
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,980
It's online.

459
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,600
You could put someone to go to the law school and they have the curriculum.

460
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,540
First year, second year, third year, four all the way down.

461
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,440
And where do they teach any law?

462
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,720
You won't find it at all.

463
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,440
It's all about how to start a legal clinic, Supreme Court opinions, constitutional

464
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,280
arguments, corporate trading, blah, blah, blah.

465
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,940
How to start a clinic again.

466
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,660
Level two.

467
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,740
Well, nothing.

468
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,520
What what law really is, where it comes from, where it should be, what the purpose, because

469
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:32,480
they're not because the way people behave, like we use that term earlier with way everything

470
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
is, they're not competent.

471
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,680
The law is not competent to them, because you can be competent or something else can

472
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,600
be incompetent.

473
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,840
Usually when you use the term competency, it refers to someone's mental aptitude, degree

474
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,760
and mental health.

475
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,600
Right, right.

476
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,680
But but when you're talking about law or rules, when it doesn't apply because you waived right

477
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,840
to it or you waived application, then that is not competent to the situation.

478
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,240
So something that is inanimate, like a law also may not be competent.

479
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,560
Right.

480
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,440
You see, it's it's this is old talk.

481
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,380
Like, for example, someone asked me at the scale or how many of these have you saw?

482
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,140
So I never sold one.

483
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,600
But I thought you said you got to, you know, a whole bunch of them out there.

484
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,940
I said, yeah, but they're not for sale.

485
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,740
They're for lease.

486
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,760
And right there for lease and is for 90 years.

487
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,240
And it's a one time settlement on the lease.

488
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,520
Right.

489
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,460
But the lease doesn't even say lease on it.

490
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,960
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,100
So what does it say?

492
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,300
I mean, you see, because I'm what I'm trying to do is create a situation where the law is

493
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,800
competent.

494
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,340
Right now, the law, if you read the lease agreement that I wrote up, you've never heard

495
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,140
anything, I guarantee you in your life before.

496
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,460
No, this is I paraphrasing.

497
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,800
If you're familiar with 19th century horse trader language, you know, like now you have

498
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
used car salesman.

499
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,040
But back in the 19th century, it was horse traders.

500
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,540
OK, you familiar with that language?

501
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,540
I'm familiar with the type of language.

502
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,640
Yeah, I get it.

503
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,780
I mean, yeah, you can be.

504
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,620
You will be in a minute.

505
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,140
I lived in a town called Ocean Grove in New Jersey.

506
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,520
Right.

507
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,220
And it's a funny thing.

508
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
You can own a house, but not the land.

509
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,620
The house is here.

510
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,940
I'll show you what competence is in the law.

511
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,280
The law being competent.

512
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,600
All right.

513
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,300
I'll tell you about it later.

514
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,280
OK, so this is only this is only OK.

515
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,060
I'll just pull it up just to get that out of the way so we don't go on a tangent.

516
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,740
Tell me about it.

517
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:28,940
Yeah.

518
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,060
But let's just do this is only this is about 55 words.

519
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,460
Ready?

520
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:33,960
All right.

521
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,700
All right.

522
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,420
So it starts off.

523
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,280
It's half a page.

524
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,140
Letting and leaving agreement doesn't say least just letting and leaving agreement for

525
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,480
an object affectionately known as the scalarator or and the Mark one, a decorative device to

526
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,160
be installed, held and used in good manner by blank, including their heirs in the signs

527
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,680
provided by its creator, Stelios, the Greek blank on blank and with mutual understanding

528
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,480
until a time of 90 years, known as the year 2114, to promise and to hold and use without

529
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,100
tamper and without malice.

530
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,560
And from time to time, its creator may improve, replace, upgrade, wilting use and holding

531
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,200
in good manner.

532
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,000
And here we come to fulfill our agreement for the sum of blank redeemed in lawful money

533
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
in accordance with 12 U.S.C.

534
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,480
411, quote, demand for lawful money, quote, clause.

535
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,520
And once fulfilled as a one time settlement of obligation with no further demand.

536
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,820
And further evidence of agreement, both have produced their appellations and marks to endorse

537
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,800
and seal this agreement.

538
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,920
That's it.

539
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,580
Does it say lease anywhere?

540
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,040
Doesn't say anything about water or doesn't say anything.

541
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,580
So someone comes back and says, well, that thing doesn't do anything for the water.

542
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,020
And he gives this to an attorney.

543
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,080
He says, well, it doesn't say anything about water here.

544
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,540
It's a matter of fact, it says it's for an object that affectionately known as the

545
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,100
mark one, a decorative device to be installed and held in good use.

546
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,360
Good use.

547
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,400
So you're going to say your lampshade is not cleaning the water?

548
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,340
No, but it's good.

549
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,080
You got no recourse, right?

550
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
It's good use, which could mean nearly anything.

551
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,160
You know, if I use it specifically to what they're complaining about.

552
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,700
So this is not the I've given this to quite a few people with doctorate degrees.

553
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,800
Even they're like, this is fine.

554
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,480
I've never heard of it called a letting elite.

555
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,260
But I said, if you I want you to read this and if you don't understand it, could you

556
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,940
show it to you and to an attorney?

557
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,640
And they're like, oh, no, I understand.

558
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,520
And I'm like, oh, my gosh, you know, they didn't really.

559
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,140
This is not a scam.

560
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,120
This is not a setup, because, by the way, it's a lease, right?

561
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,740
So, yeah, well, it's mine.

562
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,860
It's mine the whole time.

563
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,240
So but this is the reason why I'm doing this, because if the men in black come to me and

564
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,800
say, if this works, you're a dead man.

565
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,800
How many have you sold?

566
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,320
I can legally lawfully say zero.

567
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,440
I've never sold one.

568
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:56,820
Right.

569
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,500
Never sold any.

570
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,120
And here's the thing.

571
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,100
The word let you're letting at the beginning, letting and leaving.

572
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,600
OK, so letting and leaving.

573
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Well, here's the thing.

574
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,060
I understand that word letting to be like a lease anyway, because what do you do when

575
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,560
you were released as legal?

576
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,060
Letting and leaving is in law.

577
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,640
So so in other words, if you have a lease agreement, the law is not competent there.

578
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
Yeah, that's legalese.

579
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,660
Right.

580
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,420
What I was going to say is when you have an apartment, right, and somewhere and you sub

581
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,220
let it.

582
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,720
Right.

583
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,880
That basically means that you have got under your agreement, whatever that is, you have

584
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,280
let it to someone else.

585
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,060
So subletting means that it was, you know, let to you and now you have let to someone

586
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,340
else.

587
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,880
It's the second going on a second tier now, which is the sub tier.

588
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,440
Yeah.

589
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,780
So this is direct because there's no sub to it.

590
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,000
So it is letting just the same kind of thing and leaving.

591
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,220
Yeah.

592
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,440
But here's the point.

593
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,440
Doesn't imply ownership.

594
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,040
Number one, number two, most people, even those lease agreements, you know, by the way, I

595
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
remember in New York, whenever I get one, I just put a diagonal line through the top

596
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,640
and sign the bottom and I put the date of the first month's rent and that's it.

597
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,340
In other words, I would sign it and put my I would after signing it, I'd write till the

598
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,140
first month's rent.

599
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,820
So in other words, if I don't like it after a month, I don't like it here.

600
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm out of here.

601
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,200
Right.

602
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,800
You get it.

603
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,360
OK, well, yeah, and most of the time they looked at it like, why did you do that?

604
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,080
They wouldn't say.

605
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,820
Was there something in here you don't like?

606
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,780
So why did you do that?

607
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,420
Right.

608
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,160
Like, for example, I've seen people go to court and they have these long like quashing

609
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,200
a warrant or whatever.

610
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,000
If you ever read a quashing a warrant agreement, you know, quash a warrant.

611
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,800
You missed a truck.

612
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,780
You can't if you get it can't be federal.

613
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,800
You can't get you can't even get a ticket or anything for 30 days or 60 days because

614
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,700
they have a bond on you.

615
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:44,860
Right.

616
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,640
You can't whatever, whatever, whatever.

617
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,160
It's like, how would you sign the thing?

618
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,800
Oh, my gosh, the thing is so harsh.

619
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,580
Right.

620
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,100
Just put a line through it.

621
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:03,040
And most people don't understand that when you do stuff legally, it's not for your

622
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,020
benefit ever.

623
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,540
It's the one who is unilateral.

624
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,560
It's the one that's producing the legal document who's benefiting every time.

625
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,280
You see what I mean?

626
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,200
That's what I was going to point out about this thing as you read it to me.

627
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,420
Right.

628
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,180
Is that OK?

629
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,500
So you let it to someone.

630
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,740
It means that you never had a transfer of ownership.

631
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,700
No, that's for a different reason, because first of all, this is a prototype.

632
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,140
And I still don't if you ask me scientifically, tell me how it works.

633
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,320
I really can't tell you because I don't have the language.

634
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah.

635
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,000
All I know is that every time you hook it up, it does what I say it does.

636
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Right.

637
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,080
Yeah, that's fine.

638
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,220
But that's the functionality which I can get to in a minute.

639
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,380
But first thing is you're not transferring ownership because you let it.

640
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,160
So you can't you can't transfer ownership because then

641
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,980
then you go into a different form of commerce.

642
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
This is we're not doing commerce here.

643
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,180
This is not commercial.

644
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah, that's but that's the point I'm trying to make here is that if you're letting it to

645
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
someone, you're not transferring ownership.

646
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:01,960
Right.

647
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,840
Normally, if you sell something, this is another reason why this is not a sale.

648
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,080
If you sell it, it means that you granted ownership to them.

649
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,380
You transferred your ownership to them in this document.

650
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,560
You're not transferring ownership.

651
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,840
Well, you know, you want to get even deeper.

652
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,660
The reason another reason not to do it is because you're transferring your interest

653
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,420
because there's no ownership, because there's no money.

654
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:22,820
Right.

655
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,500
Well, right.

656
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,200
But you can't in a more private setting.

657
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,920
You can do it.

658
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,820
But I'm trying to be prudent here.

659
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,080
Like if someone wants, quote unquote, their money back, which, you know, they get it back.

660
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
It's no big deal because it's a matter of

661
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,480
doing it for them, you know, because in other words, I have one already.

662
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,520
Right.

663
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,200
The device to clean my water.

664
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,380
So what do I care about anybody else?

665
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:46,680
Right.

666
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,460
And I'm not doing it to create a company or a business.

667
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,840
So then so that means that I'm doing it to extend this courtesy to others.

668
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,560
So, of course, if they're not happy with it, I take it back.

669
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,000
But it's also kind of like poking fun at society, just like

670
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,840
Diogenes.

671
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,160
Right.

672
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,980
So I got you.

673
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,220
But the thing that's interesting to me that is different from, you know, your normal

674
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,420
legal paperwork here is that all of the different elements that come together in a piece of

675
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,000
paperwork that are supposed to make things work a certain way are completely absent from

676
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,040
this thing, with the exception of a transfer of legal money or lawful money, lawful, excuse

677
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,820
me, lawful money.

678
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm sorry.

679
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,840
I'm mixing up my terms because I'm trying to get it in there.

680
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,100
But anyway, that's fine.

681
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,120
When you start using the redemption, then you feel it.

682
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,300
This is what I tell people.

683
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:40,040
You can listen to Greek speak all you want, but until you start doing it, you won't really

684
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
feel it.

685
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,860
And if you don't, it's not real.

686
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,600
See, you can experience something in your mind or whatever.

687
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,140
But when you experience it in actual practice, you develop the emo for it because you cannot

688
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,980
develop an emo for something that you have not physically, not physically done, but are

689
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,660
experienced.

690
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,800
You see, so.

691
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,880
No, that's a constant.

692
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
That's a constant lesson in life that I really wish more people would learn.

693
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,840
You know, whatever they imagine something to be, it never is.

694
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,720
And no matter what we're talking about until they do it, they don't really know it.

695
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:13,940
Right.

696
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah.

697
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Well, that develops the emo and everything is based on emo anyway, because how else?

698
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,560
Otherwise, you're going to you're doomed to listen to the voices in your head.

699
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,060
By the way, are the voices in my head bothering you today?

700
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,440
Not not me.

701
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,060
No, no.

702
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,320
OK.

703
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,680
All right.

704
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,060
I don't know if they bother anybody else.

705
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,280
No, I'm just because they're there anyway.

706
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,360
So, of course, it's kind of like a sideline cynic thing to say.

707
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,780
But the reason I bring this up is because the issue of competency, just like the issue of

708
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,980
minority is an issue of competency.

709
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,720
Like, for example, when I meet black or Latino people and they say I'm a minority, I said,

710
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,620
are you competent, mentally competent or are you underage?

711
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,680
And they're like, no, I'm not underage and I am mentally accomplished.

712
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,080
So why would you call yourself a minority?

713
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,880
So this is what they're pulling on the legal system.

714
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,640
So let's say 90 percent of the U.S. was black or Latino.

715
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,520
They would still call themselves minorities, even though they're the majority in number.

716
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,760
It has nothing to do with number.

717
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,420
A minority is someone who's under 18.

718
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:13,940
Right.

719
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,179
Can't get into me.

720
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,280
A minority just means you're not you can't go into contract.

721
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,460
You're a ward of the state.

722
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,980
You have to have a guardian or someone represent you.

723
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,900
Oh, my gosh.

724
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,860
This sounds like every, quote unquote, American U.S. citizen.

725
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,000
They are the minority.

726
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:29,340
Right.

727
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,920
So in other words, the law, when someone says they're a they're part of a minority,

728
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,000
the law is not competent for them.

729
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,880
In other words, they have to go to whatever agreement, their guardian or their attorney.

730
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,080
They need to have to have an attorney, not a lawyer, an attorney specifically

731
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
represent them because they're incompetent.

732
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,620
They're a minority.

733
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,139
And you have the I'll show you how strong the programming is.

734
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,580
You have how many black and Latinos, Native American, whatever, whoever else is under

735
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,280
I think Asian people are also considered minority.

736
00:34:59,500 --> 00:34:59,640
Right.

737
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,580
If it was ninety nine point nine percent black, Latino and Asian, they would still

738
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,680
call themselves minority and they still haven't woken up.

739
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,560
That has nothing to do with a headcount, but it has to do with competency.

740
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,120
And now let's go back to the biblical.

741
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,320
They will take the curses upon themselves.

742
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:19,980
Right.

743
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,660
So if you're an adult and you're trying to operate in a society, whether it's legal or

744
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,160
lawful, you call yourself a minority.

745
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,380
It's like going out and say, hey, I'm crazy and competent.

746
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,320
I don't know what I'm doing.

747
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,060
It's the same thing.

748
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,100
It's also a question of geography as well.

749
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,400
Right.

750
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,360
Because the first time I ever questioned this in my life, I got into a weird argument

751
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,860
with somebody where they said, no, we're a minority.

752
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,400
And I said, OK, in in America, you're calling yourself a minority.

753
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,440
But, you know, if I was standing here having this conversation with you and I think Zaire

754
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,720
was the place that I called out.

755
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,700
I said, if we're having this conversation in Zaire, am I the minority?

756
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,440
Because I think I would be in within the borders of that place.

757
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,920
You're not minority because you're competent in the law.

758
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,540
In other words, when you call yourself this is not going to come about this.

759
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:16,120
If you call yourself a minority in legal parlance, that means you're incompetent and you need

760
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,520
a guardian or someone to represent you just like you were as if you were four years old.

761
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,480
Like, for example, you know, there's plenty of children in public schools that get injured

762
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,360
and they sue the school system and they get awarded a sum of cash.

763
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,280
But that child can't use that until they're 18 or 21.

764
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:32,640
Yeah.

765
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,120
Right.

766
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,420
OK, because they're a minority.

767
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,760
So if you still consider yourself a minority at 18 or 21 to go collect that, why do they

768
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,420
give it to you?

769
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,500
So it's duality.

770
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,600
They're practicing duality here.

771
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:44,880
Right.

772
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,200
Right.

773
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,420
So so all this vagueness, that's the law is not competent in that.

774
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,480
You cannot go into law if you practice that kind of stuff, either the administrative side

775
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,340
or the receiving side.

776
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,360
So let's say you have a Latino.

777
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,340
He falls and breaks his head on the water fountain in third grade and they award him

778
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,360
one hundred thousand dollars.

779
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,580
He can't use the third grade.

780
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,740
He's probably eight or seven.

781
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,980
And he can't use that until he's 18.

782
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:10,820
Right.

783
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,300
So at 18, he still considers a minority.

784
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,240
He goes and draws the check for one hundred K.

785
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,800
Right.

786
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,020
But why would they give it to him if he's a minority still?

787
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,100
So this duplicity is practiced on both sides.

788
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,180
That's why I keep saying if you know about law, you cannot be practicing attorney.

789
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,700
You cannot.

790
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,020
Because if you know about law and you start speaking to your colleagues and word gets

791
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,340
out to the Bar Association admin that, you know, law, they're going to disbar you right

792
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,920
away.

793
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,000
They'll give you like shut the fuck up or we're going to disbar you.

794
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,360
Right.

795
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,400
It's called Rule 11.

796
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,380
Right.

797
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,900
There's a rule for you look up Rule 11 for disbarment.

798
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,520
The judges threaten Rule 11 to lawyers when they bring in law, by the way, every time.

799
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,600
So where was I going with this?

800
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:55,820
Yeah.

801
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,180
If you work in any government position, doesn't matter how high or how low you know nothing

802
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,020
about government at all.

803
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,060
And how do I know this?

804
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,600
If you studied civics, which they don't teach anymore or civil law or anything like that,

805
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,820
and you go work in government and talk about it, they'll fire you and they'll make sure

806
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,180
you don't work in any government position again because all their computers are connected.

807
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,640
This is a fact.

808
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,500
Now, they do have like C-SPAN and CNN where they come out and they start asking questions

809
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,680
to Supreme Court nominees and all that.

810
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,820
That is all a show.

811
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,480
That is all scripted in a show and nobody knows what the hell anything means on both

812
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,820
sides.

813
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,160
So what kind of future do you have in a society like that?

814
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,120
I think the kind of future Diogenes talked about.

815
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,740
Yeah.

816
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,040
Yeah.

817
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,600
No, I was looking at rule 11, actually model rules for lawyer disciplinary enforcement.

818
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,500
Right.

819
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,780
Is that what it has?

820
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,020
Okay.

821
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,860
I haven't looked at it.

822
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,380
I mean, I just heard it before over and over.

823
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,540
I've never looked it up, but I figured if I dare to say, look it up and somebody yeah,

824
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
it's disciplinary enforcement.

825
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,900
Yeah.

826
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,320
Yeah.

827
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:02,720
Okay.

828
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,480
Use it that way.

829
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Tangential language.

830
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,080
Yeah.

831
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,520
Like a garbage man is a sanitation engineer.

832
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,140
Sure.

833
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,600
Why not?

834
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,720
But evaluation, the disciplinary counsel shall evaluate all information coming to his or

835
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,340
her attention by complaint or from other sources, alleging lawyer misconduct or incapacity.

836
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,640
Capacity means you're trying to bring in something that's not competent, like law.

837
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,980
Okay.

838
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,720
So attorneys are at law.

839
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,220
What do you if you have a wife, her parents, are they called at laws or in laws?

840
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,760
In laws.

841
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,060
Yeah.

842
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah.

843
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,780
Right.

844
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,200
But they should be called out laws because you don't have a lawful marriage of a legal

845
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,680
marriage.

846
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,620
So this duplicity is is it's you know how they say the rot has gotten down to the core,

847
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,920
down to the bone, right?

848
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,620
It's completely rotten to the core.

849
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,480
And I could show you in any field, whether it's the religious field, the little pastor

850
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,420
that has a little, you know, 100 person church that hands out cans and feeds the homeless.

851
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,200
It's just as much of a scumbag as the pope.

852
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,300
Right.

853
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,460
Because he's in the same business.

854
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
He might be a little kinder.

855
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,160
Right.

856
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,380
Or whatever, right?

857
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:12,880
The pope.

858
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
You ever see the pope when people kisses and he wipes his hand, right?

859
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,680
Touches him, right?

860
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,860
Like George Bush did the same thing all the time.

861
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,260
Yeah.

862
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,260
He wiped his hand.

863
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,460
Yeah.

864
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,100
Because it's slimy.

865
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,900
So it's yeah.

866
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,740
So it's really, really, really rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten down to the core society.

867
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:35,180
But it's not as rotten as it can or will be before the mop up crew does its thing.

868
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,860
It's not bad.
