1
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,840
Sonic Event 9 here on Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y and we continue with very

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,140
much the discussion that took about an hour last time, who knows how long it'll take this

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,160
time because after all, we don't actually have a pattern here that's established, unlike

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,160
previous Sonic Events where there was a two-hour template that we had to fill, however it was

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,000
or not had to fill but did fill and that's the way it went, this is a little different.

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,300
So you never quite know what you're going to get, I think even before we started recording

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,400
today, the Greek even referenced Forrest Gump, the box of chocolates, you don't know

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,020
what you're going to get, there you go, I know it's a bad impression but best I can

9
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,220
do.

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
How are you doing, Greek?

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,480
I'm doing good, this is about everybody's leisure, ours and theirs and ours and theirs

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,340
and whoever's listening, it's about leisure.

13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,500
So you find out what we've said and you hear it and hopefully it works out for everyone.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,900
Yeah, what I wanted to bring up was what we usually do lately is going back to the feedback

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,100
and there's a ton of it and at the same time, there's not that much.

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,420
A ton of it meaning there's so much depth you could go into with all the various questions

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,800
and things that are brought up, whether it's emails or the chat but at the same time,

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,600
I think they could be answered in short but poignantly given the important stuff.

19
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,820
Right, fair enough.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,500
And look, I do appreciate the multiple messages I get just saying, you know, look, this is

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,160
really great, glad this is happening again and thank you and this and that.

22
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,440
I appreciate all that but frankly, there's nothing I can do with it constructively and

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
neither can you.

24
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,700
Now when there's more proactive, I guess would be the right term, communications, we can

25
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,880
do something with it, right?

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, just picking up on any communication is fine, which is good.

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,020
But by the way, this is number nine and the last one we did, we finished up on a bunch

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,820
of stuff, mostly on timekeeping, right?

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,080
I just want to bring up real quick, the chat lately has been mostly on the timekeeping

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,260
and one of the comments there was why three sticks and you can make any visual representation

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,760
of the solar measurement that you like, you get creative, right?

32
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,100
If you're into making things, right, a constructive type, you'll notice that let's say you're

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,500
building a frame, let's say a picture frame and you got four sides, it's supposed to be

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,940
a square.

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,180
There's several ways to figure out whether it's a true square, you know, by 90 degrees

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,980
in each corner or you can measure the diagonals, right?

37
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,800
If you measure the diagonals and they're equal, right, you can make spacers and all this other

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,080
stuff.

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,180
So long as you're, yeah, but you got to make sure your diagonal line is exactly straight

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,020
because if you make the diagonal line a little crooked, then it's not quite right.

41
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,900
But yeah, there's various ways to make it rigid.

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,140
Rigid and straight.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,940
Rigid and straight.

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,220
Yeah.

45
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,520
Just tell the ladies like it.

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah.

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,580
So anyway.

48
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't know.

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,480
I've heard they don't necessarily always like straight, but look, I'm not going to speak

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,780
for that.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,260
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,700
Go ahead.

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,900
I have not been lascivious since we've done this.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,180
So anyway.

55
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,220
No, but there's plenty of opportunities.

56
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,760
Anyway.

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,180
Of course.

58
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,540
Yes.

59
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:43,940
Yes.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,020
And that's what they say too.

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,780
Okay.

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,500
So based on how constructive you are and how you would like to view it is the way it's done.

63
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,460
You know, there really is, there's slight mention in, let's say the book of Isaiah,

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,640
there was a sundial.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,860
It's actually, it was called a sun stand, if you translate it in Hebrew, what it looked

66
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,080
like.

67
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,620
We're not sure.

68
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,660
So anything works.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Even a building works.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,300
I use, I have a metal shelf.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,040
That's one of these like restaurant type metro shelves with, it's kind of like an open.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,600
And as the light comes through one of the empty shelves, it forms this very interesting

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,100
shadow, and you can tell when it's noon because the shadow is the shortest, right?

74
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,200
And instead of building things that you're going to trip over if you don't have enough

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,040
space, which I do have enough space, but I just happen to rely on whatever is around.

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,960
So the three lines in the dirt, as they would say, they would be parallel in a sense.

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,260
But they would also exaggerate what angle is happening instead of one, right?

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,280
Instead of having one line, it's easier to see three lines.

79
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
Let me just say it this way.

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
An angle is more visible with three lines than just one, for example, right?

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,840
So that's one thing.

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,400
I thought it was an interesting proposition to have three things showing a shadow, and

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
it was an interesting question why.

84
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,940
The other thing I wanted to mention regarding time was the datum line or the reference

85
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,780
when the day starts, or let's just, the day would be your local solar noon.

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,080
But when the day for the new moon starts, meaning the full moon, I never really brought

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,420
that up.

88
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,040
I think I brought it up once or twice.

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm not sure if I did it on the old Oteli in the Greek, but it starts around central

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Iraq.

91
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,140
There's a website called Time and Date Night Sky or Time and Date.

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,740
If you put in night sky, it'll show you bodies.

93
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,400
And also, there's several other websites.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,880
There's one that is geographic that shows you the earth, what they call the earth, the

95
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,440
planet, let's say, and where the moon is.

96
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,660
You could look that up, the moon in the sky or the moon on the earth.

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,580
I think it's that die.net also if you navigate that site.

98
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,780
And you will see that when it comes down to the first day of the month, it begins around

99
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,800
central Iraq.

100
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,760
So prior to that, you'll see the moon, it'll be 99% full or 95% full.

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,100
And when it goes, when it's coming around the time to be the first of the month, when

102
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:35,600
it reaches the moon over what is visibly known to be full over central Iraq, you will see

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,900
that it switches from 95% or 98% to 100% or 99%, which is usually 99% or 100% is pretty

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,800
much 100%.

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
And that change happens over central Iraq.

106
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,040
Think about that for a moment.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,420
That's been highlighted and underscored in history as Mesopotamia, right?

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,180
Like you said, the cradle, mankind and all that.

109
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, the cradle of civilization, a lot of people call it, yeah.

110
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,780
From a cultural perspective.

111
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,400
So this phenomenon of using the full moon or the moon to gauge the month, which actually

112
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,840
it's not a phenomenon, but it is the actual month.

113
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,280
Well, is there a why on this or is there just a, that just happens to be the circumstance?

114
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,240
I mean, that's just how it is.

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,440
It happens to be the circumstance.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,840
In ancient calendars before the moon and before people got used to the cycles of the

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,740
moon, it was just a day count, like the Julian calendar is just a day count.

118
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,180
Right.

119
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,720
Okay.

120
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
So we live in a very changed world.

121
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:40,840
One day there's a presumptive history that things that we see that we're told are hundreds

122
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,280
of millions of years old or not, some things that are hundreds of millions of years old

123
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,700
that really are, we're told we're not.

124
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,540
So everything's kind of inverted.

125
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,120
But yeah, the earth is a wanderer, a strange planet.

126
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,020
We don't see it wandering that much because there's high precision in astronomy, but not

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,820
too long ago it was wandering around.

128
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,720
That's why when you read some ancient stuff, Mercury was Venus and Venus changed places.

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah, pretty interesting stuff.

130
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,860
I don't have enough of reference material or background to, let's say, speak on it,

131
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:23,080
but it might be something in my future to look into again if the opportunity comes up.

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,180
Well, the astronomical bodies above, right, they're always of interest because they are

133
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,080
relevant and people say, I mean, look, people say a lot of things about the influence of

134
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,620
them over us and over events on the planet.

135
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:47,420
Of course, astrology is a whole industry devoted to it at this point, on top of the reality

136
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,380
of it.

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,100
How many astrologers reckon the month starts with the moon?

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,340
Yeah, well, there you go.

139
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,800
They've missed it.

140
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,400
It's like doctors talking about blood pressure.

141
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,460
Yeah, it's, sorry, but you're not going to find that.

142
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,560
Well, that's stuff for the collective, which is generally baloney.

143
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,280
I think we were speaking on this once, I'm not sure if we did it on air, but if someone

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,240
comes to you and they call themselves a shaman, well, real shamans don't call themselves shaman.

145
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,820
Right.

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,940
If someone comes to you and says they're a witch or a wizard, guess what?

147
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,500
Real witches and real wizards don't label themselves as such.

148
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:25,920
Right.

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,920
If someone comes to you and says they're a healer, guess what?

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,220
Real healers.

151
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,000
If someone comes and says to you they're a prophet, guess what?

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,500
They're not.

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,260
Okay, you see where I'm going with this?

154
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,440
Oh, yeah.

155
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,380
So when someone says I'm an astrologer, guess what?

156
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,840
They're not.

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,220
There you go.

158
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,860
We've just proved it just by what they can focus on, even not what they do focus, what

159
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,620
their limitations.

160
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,940
You just look at their limitations.

161
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,600
Right.

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,820
Speaking of limitations.

163
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,020
I was going to say exactly that, actually.

164
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,160
Speaking of limitations and doctors.

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,100
Let's go back to one of the previous things we've talked about.

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,520
Because the body, I mean, look, you just brought up doctors right there, right?

167
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,340
As soon as they start talking about blood pressure.

168
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,220
Now, they should be talking about pressure or the pressure of a vacuum, as we discussed

169
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,840
with the container originally and have expanded upon and rated wide now.

170
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,000
But some interesting things here, because one of the most common ailments, so to speak,

171
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,120
is diabetes, right?

172
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,020
I mean, this is definitely, of course, there are people listening in other countries, but

173
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,180
in America, I'm not sure if the whole world is like this, but in America, diabetes is

174
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,160
a dominant issue, let's say.

175
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,660
It's not an ailment, by the way.

176
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,240
It's a diagnosis.

177
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,000
There's a big difference between having a diagnosis and having an ailment.

178
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,080
It's kind of like if you talk about the judicial system, if you're a criminal and you're dubbed

179
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,060
a criminal, labeled as a criminal, well, you say, why?

180
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,700
Because I was accused for stealing rocks from the moon.

181
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,420
And I didn't put them back.

182
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,060
Right?

183
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
You see what I mean?

184
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:01,740
Okay.

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
How ridiculous is that, right?

186
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,780
What I'm saying is that this is very important, actually.

187
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,040
They even say it's diagnosed.

188
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,260
No one has ever had 99% of the diseases that they proclaim to treat or that they have in

189
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,600
their book.

190
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,380
Those are all diagnoses, you see?

191
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:29,120
So anyway, what I wanted to bring up about that is with recent short conversation, what

192
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,060
inextricably anyone who's been long enough diagnosed with diabetes and receives the quote

193
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,900
unquote standard treatment, they end up being on what?

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Kidney dialysis, aren't they?

195
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,100
Don't they?

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,380
Usually toward the end of their lives, yeah.

197
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,400
There's always a period of dialysis for sure.

198
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,420
Due to kidney failure.

199
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Due to kidney failure, but yeah, go ahead.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,500
So what it is really is a liver function.

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,640
I also brought up before we started recording, it's really difficult to broach on a subject

203
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,180
that requires eight hours of study, and I'm talking about just quickly going through stuff

204
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,900
for eight hours.

205
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,940
In the ancient Eastern medicine, which is not woo-woo, it's not superstition, it's based

206
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,780
on 3,000 years of observation or more, and that's what real science is, by the way.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,200
You have a theory or a hypothesis, and you make an experiment, conduct an experiment,

208
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,240
and through observation, you come up with a conclusion.

209
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,860
Through observation, right?

210
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,240
You keep going through observation.

211
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,860
So this is what the Eastern medicine is based on.

212
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,960
And based on the ideas that they have, from formative energies to all the way to human

213
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,160
manifestations, it seems very contrasting to the way we speak on medicine in the Western

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,300
world because of the cultural difference and the point of view that they have.

215
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,920
But their point of view is that if you study Eastern medicine, the pancreas do not exist

216
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,980
as a solo organ, right?

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,380
There's no blood sugar and all that.

218
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,840
By the way, what they're measuring with blood sugar strips is not sugar in the blood.

219
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,500
That's absurd.

220
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,780
It's not possible to do that objectively.

221
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,620
They're measuring your level of hydration.

222
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,260
And you can even go online and research, if I'm dehydrated or I drink water, what does

223
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,840
it do to the blood sugar measurement?

224
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
It goes crazy.

225
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,320
It doesn't work because it all has to do with how much water the liver can process at a

226
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,960
dehydrated.

227
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,760
So if you're taking those tests, they have electronic ones or the paper prick, that's

228
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,400
just measuring how your liver is handling your hydration level.

229
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,000
That's all.

230
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,500
There's no blood sugar test at all.

231
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,020
So forget about all that.

232
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,340
Forget about the pancreas as a solo organ.

233
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,860
It's really a liver function.

234
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,580
And the liver, in plural, if you're talking about more than one person, let's say, is

235
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,960
tied completely to the kidneys.

236
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,060
And in the Asian viewpoint, that manages the fire energy in the body.

237
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,300
And if you want to be, let's say, a juvenile perspective, I don't know if you remember

238
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,260
the little choo-choo trains, the steam engines that they used to show us as children in the

239
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,400
60s and 70s as an example of a machine.

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,180
If you think of the human fire, by the way, the human energy, there's an aspect of it

241
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,560
known as the fire aspect.

242
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,920
That is managed by the kidneys and the liver back and forth.

243
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,660
So when you have a liver function problem, anything that goes into the body, even air

244
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,840
by the way, will be reckoned by the liver.

245
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,580
The liver is the fastest reacting organ in the body.

246
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
It's an internal organ that has no exposure to the outside.

247
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
And it's tied to the kidneys.

248
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:47,420
So here we have something that people are overly toxified or stressed or whatever, and

249
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,520
they diagnose it as a blood sugar problem, completely off kilter.

250
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,380
And what's really going on is the liver function is being broken down or it's out of whack

251
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,260
as they say, but it's tied to the kidneys.

252
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,960
And proof of that is by watching the historical progress and degradation of people diagnosed

253
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,600
with diabetes.

254
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,280
I just wanted to bring up the kidney aspect because when we did lay into this subject

255
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,340
a few episodes ago, sonic events let's say, I didn't emphasize the kidney tie-in on this.

256
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,480
So it's very important.

257
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,080
And maybe when we get into food, which will probably be solos in the future, not too far

258
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,700
from the future but not next week let's say, I'll bring up how these various things affect

259
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,720
various parts of the body.

260
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,100
I just wanted to throw that in there.

261
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,920
Very, very, very important.

262
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,700
Because as you mentioned also, Chuck, that they always end up on kidney dialysis.

263
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,820
So what does that have to do with blood sugar?

264
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,540
Not much.

265
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,620
No, not much at all.

266
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,620
And it's always, to me, I always think of it as a problem with filtration.

267
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,220
Because that's what I think of those organs as doing a lot, is filtering.

268
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,160
They're not actually.

269
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:58,660
They're not.

270
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,900
They appear to be.

271
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,520
They appear to be, right?

272
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,860
They appear to be.

273
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,100
What they're doing is, it's no different than what a radio and a CB, it's kind of like the

274
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,840
brain transmitting and receiving in the non-local environment.

275
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,160
The body is, all the organs are transmitting and receiving within the contained environment

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,140
known as the body or the container let's say.

277
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,440
And they're actually taking materials in the body that are lost energy and it's time

278
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
for them to exit.

279
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,140
So they dematerialize and they rematerialize within organs that have ducts that lead to

280
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,160
the outside, like the bladder and the kidneys and things like that.

281
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,500
Right.

282
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
And when they rematerialize, they get their last bit of energy.

283
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:50,480
Now, what's important, and we'll go on to other topics, the eliminative organs, the

284
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,320
intestines are different because it's just a tunnel.

285
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,680
But the eliminative organs in the body, kidneys, bladder, and all this other stuff, have a

286
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,079
very crucial job because they take things from the blood and the lymphatic fluid and

287
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,980
other aspects of the body, there are gaseous aspects to the body as well, and dematerialize

288
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,160
them from the internal body into the organ to then exit the body.

289
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,740
And I've never brought this up before, because I've been contemplating on this and observing

290
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,900
it for a long time, but I've never brought this up in any sonic event in public.

291
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:29,780
What's very important that has been missed on this also is when this dematerialization

292
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,700
takes place to the kidneys and the bladder, sometimes the colon, but the intestines are

293
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,420
different, because it's just a tunnel again.

294
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,960
When this dematerialization takes place, it's very important from an energetic point of

295
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,580
view and materialist point of view that those nutritive factors, let's say that you've

296
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,980
gotten from food, do not revert back to being food once they're past the intestinal system.

297
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,160
So what I mean by that is if you eat a banana, it goes through the intestines, whatever the

298
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,540
body recognizes will dematerialize in the intestine and rematerialize inside the body as what

299
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,520
we call nutrition to build cells and whatever, vitalize whatever it could vitalize.

300
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,820
And when it becomes devitalized, after it's been reproduced in the body, it's time for

301
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,640
it to go, so it gets reproduced again in, let's say, the kidneys and bladder to exit.

302
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,320
It's like opening an old flashlight, toss the batteries out, but it dematerializes.

303
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,080
At that point, for example, the kidney and bladder point, when it dematerializes to go

304
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,380
out, it's very important that the body keeps it together so it doesn't want to revert back

305
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,920
to a banana, its constituents that was originally in the body.

306
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,180
If it does so, you become toxified, and that's one of the causes, quote-unquote, of cancer,

307
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,120
tumors and all those other things.

308
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,540
It's very interesting.

309
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm trying to find a study.

310
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,920
When they did biopsies on tumors and things like that, they didn't recognize the DNA or

311
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,200
the molecules because they ended up looking just like food.

312
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,900
So you see, it didn't look like human tissue.

313
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,600
Sometimes it does resemble.

314
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,320
Some tumors actually develop certain body parts, like teeth.

315
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,100
There are tumors that have been removed from people on different parts of the body, and

316
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,040
when the tumor is examined, there's a tooth in it.

317
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,720
How is that possible?

318
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,820
Or hair, you see.

319
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,200
How is that possible?

320
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,880
It's kind of bizarre, right?

321
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,100
It is a strange thought, that's for sure, but I'm thinking to myself, if you dematerialize

322
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,780
and then rematerialize, when that happens, it's building something like that, and it's

323
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,980
just building it in the wrong place.

324
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,820
It's just building the thing in the wrong place.

325
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,900
It's not putting hair on the head or something, you know, where it should go.

326
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah, it's inside the tumor, a tooth inside, or a banana.

327
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,300
You'll see what looks like just a cooked banana or pieces of food, but not in, you know, it'll

328
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,580
be on a molecular level, you know.

329
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,320
It's very interesting.

330
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,920
Well, it's kind of like in one of the Star Trek movies, or the movies that they did,

331
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,820
not the series, where they fired up the, what do they call that thing, where they beam people,

332
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,720
the transporter.

333
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,500
The transporter, yeah.

334
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,860
And there was a malfunction, and they ended up, the person ended up becoming like a lump

335
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,400
of bones that was screaming, you know.

336
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,420
Oh, yeah.

337
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,280
That was at the beginning of the very first, the Star Trek movie they put out in the 70s,

338
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,980
the first one.

339
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,500
Right.

340
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,680
And they started to rematerialize him, it wasn't going well, so they sent it back.

341
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,200
And when they did, they got a message that said, what we got back didn't last long.

342
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:38,840
There you go.

343
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,000
They didn't actually show it, but the implication was.

344
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,500
It was the transfer of information that got screwed up.

345
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,540
Right, right.

346
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,020
You see?

347
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,340
So the same thing happens in the body.

348
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,980
I like to lean heavily on that transporter in Star Trek, because that's exactly what's

349
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,750
happening, but every time the energy and nutrition goes in and out of the body, it gets transmuted

350
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,780
or transported into the form the body can use, right?

351
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,600
But what I'm trying to maybe summarize here is that when it doesn't and it reverts back

352
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,200
to how it was before it was put into the body, before you ate it, it's very dangerous, right?

353
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,340
And that's why I also brought up the body in that screw-up mode will produce teeth and

354
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,860
hair and other body parts in the tumors that are removed.

355
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,980
I'm talking about tumors that are removed from the abdomen, tumors that are removed from

356
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,400
the neck, tumors that are removed from the brain, all different parts of the body.

357
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,620
So this is bizarre.

358
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,700
By the way, this is very well recorded in medical manuals, but that's all it is.

359
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
It's just listed what they found.

360
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,180
There's no why, there's no how, there's no ... And you know what?

361
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,360
No one's asking.

362
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,200
Because if people did ask in the medical community why this is happening, there would have been

363
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,120
a revolution within the system and it would have been revamped a long time ago.

364
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,620
Well, they would have had to automatically start including the idea that there is this,

365
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,960
for lack of a better term, dematerialization and rematerialization of things going on in

366
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,800
the body, which would absolutely contradict the majority of what it is that these people

367
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,340
tell you through absorption and all that, right?

368
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:10,760
Yeah.

369
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,780
Well, they're telling us we're, in essence, I've summed it up as that we are pressurized

370
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,040
filter bags.

371
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,060
We're sponges almost because we suck up things and then whatever we suck up, we can squeeze

372
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,720
it back out.

373
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,600
And I mean, that's pretty much what it's like, but we're-

374
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,960
Pressurized filter bag.

375
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,300
In industry, like a vacuum cleaner bag or something, you use filter bags in water also.

376
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,880
But yeah, so it's bizarre.

377
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,720
It shows you a severe lacking in cultural, let's say, integrity.

378
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,100
I wouldn't say advancement.

379
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,440
There's no integrity in the system.

380
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,400
So what else do we want to ... Let's just bounce around over here.

381
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,780
I just wanted to throw those things in.

382
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,020
These are like afterthoughts.

383
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,440
I could shoot.

384
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,040
I should have mentioned these things.

385
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,020
And they're very deep, by the way.

386
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,960
The aspect of the human body, the way it works, I've been discussing this for over two decades

387
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,380
now and minimal feedback, and it's hard to see how it could help someone directly.

388
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,220
But once you start working it in your own mind, each individual that hears this content,

389
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,840
let's say, about how the body works will figure out their own way how to apply it.

390
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,240
Right.

391
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,600
Because we haven't gotten a group of people together to fund a massive research project

392
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,800
and to develop this as, quote unquote, functional science that's available to everyone.

393
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,400
You know, ha, ha, ha, it's not going to happen.

394
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:28,880
Right.

395
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,140
And I think I've prefaced that.

396
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,900
This is not going to happen in this society.

397
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,920
But I just wanted to bring it up because if it's in the mind, where do things start?

398
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,700
As a thought, right?

399
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Oh, that's true.

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
If you get somebody just ... Like I observed about the timekeeping, when I started just

401
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,040
to internalize the idea and place in my mind that the solar noon beginning of the day,

402
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,820
there's already ... I can't even really describe the changes, but I feel quite differently

403
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,000
about a bunch of things that I'm trying to ... Well, not that I'm trying, that I am accomplishing,

404
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,100
that I am working on.

405
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,100
It's different.

406
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,540
It's a double negative because you know what?

407
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,320
The day always started at noon whether you knew it or not.

408
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,360
You just realizing something that you were, let's say, quote unquote, deprived of or distracted from.

409
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:17,860
Right.

410
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,640
Right.

411
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,980
But it's given me a different comfort zone in the day, which is one weird thing, where

412
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,900
I used to have a certain time of day where I just did better whatever task I set myself to.

413
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,480
It was better for me to do things at certain times of day, right?

414
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,920
But this has changed things a bit because just ...

415
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,280
So if you have a sedentary lifestyle and people make fun of you because you wake up at noon,

416
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,260
you got a good answer.

417
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,520
Mm-hmm.

418
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,940
That's what I tell people about it.

419
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,120
Right.

420
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,900
Sleep till noon, till the new day starts.

421
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,460
I'm just joking.

422
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,700
That's not how our sleep cycles work anyway.

423
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,800
No.

424
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,660
Our sleep cycles work with light most likely.

425
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,160
By the way, people that do work at night and sleep in the day, it's been, even in their

426
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,160
science, it's shown to have a much shorter 15% to 20% lifespan as a whole, generally.

427
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,140
So it doesn't mean that you need sunlight directly.

428
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,220
And the other thing that sun causes cancer is baloney because 90% of the people spent

429
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,300
90% of the time in the sun for the past 5,000 years.

430
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,720
If it was true that sun caused cancer, everyone would have been dead 4,000 years ago, right?

431
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,200
Mm-hmm.

432
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,080
1,000 years of this cancer-causing element.

433
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,560
Right.

434
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,220
So 90% of the people 90% of the time are in the sun.

435
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,660
It has to do with the photosensitivity, right?

436
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,660
Certain foods will break down your ability to process the light, let's say.

437
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Okay.

438
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,600
Yeah.

439
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,940
So I wanted to cover, these are just little afterthoughts that after we've done the sonics

440
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,500
that I should have thrown in somehow and just didn't, just to help, bouncing around.

441
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:50,800
Right.

442
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,360
Fair enough.

443
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,380
But you also got some emails too, and I don't know if you want to address any of them directly.

444
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Yeah.

445
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,500
Sure.

446
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,520
I don't know if you do also, but like I said, the majority of them were just complimentary,

447
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,360
like, glad to hear this.

448
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,020
This is good.

449
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:12,000
I know I got one from, I think we both got a message from, let's call him Joe, and you

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
know who I'm referring to probably.

451
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,080
It was very nice, very kind that he enjoyed.

452
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,600
Look, I'm more than happy to see someone just enjoying the discussion and the information

453
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
for sure.

454
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,040
You know, if it's pleasurable to somebody, then that might let it settle into their minds

455
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,400
a bit easier too.

456
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Right?

457
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,260
I mean.

458
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,620
Yeah.

459
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,860
But no news is good news.

460
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,580
So the positive ones or the negative ones, either way, you know, just don't send poop

461
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,080
in the mail.

462
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,340
You know?

463
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:40,720
Yeah.

464
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,760
It's kind of counterproductive.

465
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,040
Yeah.

466
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,540
That's the good thing about emails.

467
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,720
But that's fine in terms of that.

468
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,280
I think I've always gotten more from criticism and it is possible to have positive criticism

469
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,680
also.

470
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,100
I mean, I think that's what this is about.

471
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,540
What we're doing and have been doing is just bringing things forward that are just right

472
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,540
at everyone's doorstep, so to speak, but no one's discussing.

473
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,120
And once these things are discussed, you have a more thorough examination of your reality.

474
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,460
Right?

475
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,080
I mean, talking about going to other planets or going to the bottom of the ocean is not

476
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,380
as relevant of what's going on five feet in front of you and that's what the whole thing

477
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,840
is about.

478
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,300
No.

479
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,820
And all the other Greeks speak.

480
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,160
Right.

481
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,980
But look, there was absolutely nothing wrong with touching on the vehicles that we talked

482
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,140
about, the space vehicles, toward the end of last Sonic.

483
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
That's always interesting.

484
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,360
I think you and I were, yeah, we didn't get that on recordation, but yeah, they've been

485
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,380
trying to go to space.

486
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,020
I noticed the key word trying with what they show us.

487
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,400
It doesn't work that way and I'm not sure how it works, but it's not what they're showing

488
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,620
us.

489
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,100
That's the other thing to remember.

490
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,240
Whatever you're being told as this is how it is, it's not that way.

491
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,560
Well, we did record a little bit of that because we were talking about AI toward the

492
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,100
end, actually.

493
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,740
Ah, yes.

494
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,260
That's right.

495
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,540
Yeah.

496
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,200
I don't, don't worry about that.

497
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
I brought this up.

498
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,620
I've been bringing this up for about two years now and I've stopped, but I don't know if

499
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:13,340
you guys remember about a decade ago or more, they were blasting and blasting everyone

500
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:19,600
with quantum this, quantum that, quantum batteries, quantum fishing poles, quantum juice, quantum,

501
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,900
quantum, quantum, right?

502
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,180
Remember?

503
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:21,900
Mm-hmm.

504
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,540
They stopped.

505
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,180
Now it's the AI, AI, AI.

506
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,660
You know what?

507
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,620
There is no quantum, right?

508
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,520
There's no spooky action at a distance.

509
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,440
There's none of this stuff.

510
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,920
They don't understand what perturbations and pressures are and there's no gravity waves

511
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,980
or anything like that.

512
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Gravity's not a force, by the way.

513
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,580
People talk about the force of gravity.

514
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,040
Mm-hmm.

515
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,960
It's an acceleration.

516
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,520
Accelerations are not forces.

517
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,640
If you guys want a good primer on this kind of talk, by the way, look up, I'm going to

518
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,040
do a plug for Ken Wheeler, Ken Wheeler, spell it just like it is, like a wheel, Wheeler,

519
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Etherea Apophasis, the big, fat, ugly, bald, tattooed guy, and I'm not giving him a pejorative

520
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,360
that he doesn't use himself.

521
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
He calls himself that.

522
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
He's wonderful to listen to.

523
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,660
In terms of that, he sounds like he's technical, but if you get a feeling of the words that

524
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,400
he uses, it won't sound technical after a few videos.

525
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,520
He's been running parallel to, his research is parallel to what I've been doing for many

526
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,820
years before I even knew about him.

527
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,060
I like his take on it.

528
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Why go over most of the stuff that he goes over?

529
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,680
Again, I don't.

530
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,400
I just throw in my own originality in it.

531
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,580
Ken Wheeler, I'm throwing a plug in for him, definitely.

532
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,560
I wasn't aware you were aware of Ken Wheeler, actually.

533
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
I've encountered him before, too.

534
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,120
If you watch his stuff, it won't hurt.

535
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,460
Actually, it'll help, especially if you don't get intimidated by the words that he uses.

536
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,620
I like to keep stuff simple.

537
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,480
Cosmic censorship, dummy load, whatever, whatever.

538
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,060
He gets into more technical stuff, but you'll get used to it if you have the interest.

539
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,160
At some point, I do want to go back over cosmic censorship because, again, I feel as though

540
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
there is a shift that is happening.

541
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,340
We talked about that.

542
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,460
When we get into more discussion of the gods, I'm going to bring up how these things happen

543
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,280
as a mechanism.

544
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Right.

545
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,900
That's what I'm interested in.

546
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,020
Matter of fact, we were going to discuss a little bit about the gods today.

547
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,600
We are.

548
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,520
I think some of that might come from those emails, right?

549
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,400
Mostly the chat.

550
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,680
The early chat from a couple of weeks ago.

551
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,820
Talk about the gods was on blast.

552
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,660
One of the things I wanted to bring up in the emails was a question that I've always...

553
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,580
I'm not sure if I did it so much publicly as privately.

554
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,440
One of the questions was...

555
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,260
I get the same question once every six months from various people.

556
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,160
How do we find a partner?

557
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,520
Or if it's a man, how do I find a wife?

558
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,920
It's mostly from how do I find a wife or a partner?

559
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,340
It seems that the ladies are more relaxed about it, but I've gotten it from them as well.

560
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,420
This is number Sonic 9.

561
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,940
Let's call it the interjection Sonic.

562
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,480
We're just all over the place like a banana in a monkey grove.

563
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:18,980
I know.

564
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,640
Get it?

565
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,040
Get it?

566
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:20,960
All right.

567
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,720
How do you find a mate?

568
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,340
What it's about is...

569
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,000
Jordan Maxwell brought this up about partnerships.

570
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,980
It's all business.

571
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,120
Even on a personal...

572
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,040
Someone's asking you something personal.

573
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,960
People respond, it's none of your business.

574
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,400
Right.

575
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,620
Even if it's a personal thing, right?

576
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
So everything seems to be commercial.

577
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,480
Isn't a marriage a covenant, an agreement, a contract, right?

578
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,900
It is a contract.

579
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,080
It is a contract.

580
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:59,160
Look, I often bring up the idea that, look, when you go get a marriage license, you're

581
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,180
asking permission to form a merger, which is what you're asking the government to do

582
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,960
when you're doing that with their paperwork.

583
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:15,380
Now, there is a difference between that and really forming a covenant or actually getting

584
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,160
together with a mate.

585
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,900
There are business contracts here.

586
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,480
That's true, isn't it?

587
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,520
It is.

588
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,180
It is, but there's a big difference when it's lawful and legal.

589
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,020
Like a marriage contract...

590
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,540
Is legal?

591
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,680
No, it's lawful.

592
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,260
It's lawful, but the marriage license is legal.

593
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,100
Oh, okay.

594
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,460
Okay.

595
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,800
Yeah.

596
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,220
Because legal pertains to law.

597
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,360
See, in law it says you have a right to do business, and in the constitutions you have

598
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,160
a right to secure in your papers, right?

599
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,740
You've heard that?

600
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Yes, of course.

601
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:43,740
Okay.

602
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,560
In all government paperwork, the word security does not mean like locking your doors.

603
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,620
It means money.

604
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,240
So, do you know the hidden translation?

605
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,660
One of these days...

606
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,820
Actually, this is something I need to write because I brought this up to some old attorneys

607
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:05,360
and they told me I should write a book on it to basically translate the constitution

608
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,060
and old law, let's say, into English.

609
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,380
What are you talking about, Greg?

610
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,660
It already is written in English.

611
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
No, it needs translation.

612
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,900
When you read to be secure in your papers, and it has nothing to do with locking them

613
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,160
up.

614
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,180
It has to do with commerce and the monetary value.

615
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,500
They're basically telling you that if you don't want to monetize your records, your

616
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,340
lawful records of birth, you shouldn't have to.

617
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,580
Let's think about that for a minute, right?

618
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,660
So, legal, all that legal stuff.

619
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,160
Driver's license, by the way, came out from the Uniform Slave Codes or Marriage License.

620
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:47,040
Uniform Slave Codes of 1750 here in the colonies because when a slave escaped one state, there

621
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,400
was different punishments in all the different states, right?

622
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,740
So, they wanted to make it uniform.

623
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,820
So, when the slaves married, they had to be licensed.

624
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,560
Passports, driver's license, liquor license, gun license, all the licensing came from the

625
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,060
Slave Codes.

626
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:08,980
So, yeah, in a lawful situation, legal just means it's been securitized, monetized.

627
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,360
March the 9th, 1933 is all I got to say about that, right?

628
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,699
So, for the Americans, every country has its own March the 9th, 1933.

629
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,420
So, how do you find a wife?

630
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,980
How do you find a partner and all that?

631
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,320
And it's an agreement.

632
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,800
It's based on – and everything I'm going to be speaking on is in law, not legal.

633
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,940
It doesn't mean that legal is bad.

634
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,440
It just means that legal is like a very low form of law that's applied to those that

635
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,560
are not really aware of law but are more aware of their fiefdom without admitting it, right?

636
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,320
So, when a lawyer walks into a room, into a situation, most people get afraid.

637
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,380
And I've actually spoken to people, older people, oh, I was raised to be afraid of them,

638
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,300
right?

639
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,960
Because they were used throughout history.

640
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,980
They were used throughout history to control the people that were in fiefdoms, you know,

641
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:07,700
serfs.

642
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,460
Intuitively, I just wish to avoid lawyers when I can.

643
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,420
No, I don't mind.

644
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,060
I like interacting with them every time it's – this way I don't know what's going

645
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,800
on in their field.

646
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,660
But when I speak to a few attorneys or what they call police, every so often I get a feeling.

647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,440
You go look beyond the character also.

648
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,920
But I just wanted to lean very heavily on – I don't think I ever have, maybe a

649
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,380
little bit on lawful versus legal.

650
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,200
It's not versus.

651
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,580
It's just that legal is a very low form of it, right, of law.

652
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,220
It means you've already – you're under privileges and things.

653
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,440
It's not very good.

654
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,700
It means you lost everything and now – but you're still functioning.

655
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,060
So in law, OK, it was kind of a long roundabout way.

656
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,540
When you meet a partner or you would like to have a partner, how do you meet them?

657
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,280
How do you hold them?

658
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,520
OK.

659
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,360
First of all, the whole thing is knowing thyself.

660
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,480
Are you the type of person that does better solo or a person that does better with others?

661
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:17,080
Personally, I like being hitched up, being in a partnership with mostly anything I do,

662
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,420
especially in the long term, having a wife.

663
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,480
I enjoy that.

664
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,800
I've tried both, being – living solo or living with someone and not just a roommate

665
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,000
because actually some people that do have roommate situations like, oh, I'm going

666
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,680
to get my own place.

667
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,820
I can't stand having roommates.

668
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,700
So this is very different.

669
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,400
This is where you're intimate in every way.

670
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,980
OK?

671
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,320
With finances, with your personal life, with everything.

672
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,700
OK?

673
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,820
So how do you find that?

674
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,620
Well, it's very simple.

675
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,960
One of the ways – I think Thoreau actually said love should be like light and not like

676
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,660
fire because – right?

677
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,340
OK?

678
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,320
So that's just a quote.

679
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,660
By the way, I do like those Thoreau quotes.

680
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,300
Everyone wants to – Henry Thoreau, look up his quotes.

681
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,540
It's the closest stuff I've ever seen to Greek-speak.

682
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,860
So basically finding and hitching up and finding a partner, a husband or a wife, is very, very

683
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,240
simple.

684
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,960
It doesn't mean it's easy.

685
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,420
First of all, you have to make the determination long term, which how do you know if you haven't

686
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,440
passed long term, right?

687
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,080
Either way, whether you should be with someone or not.

688
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,640
But for most people, it is better to be with a partner.

689
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:35,840
It's what set of covenants or rules do you live by and is the person that you're with

690
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,000
as a husband or a wife also going to live by those rules?

691
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,200
It's very important to have those rules.

692
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,180
And I'm not talking about rules like rules of a game or something like that.

693
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,640
But there are general rules.

694
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,020
When you get into a situation where it's because this – the man has authority or

695
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,780
in some places the woman has authority.

696
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,360
And in Native American culture, it's still customary that all the judicial judges are

697
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,860
women, right?

698
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,700
Because it's a matriarchal system, which we'll get more about when we talk about the

699
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:05,980
gods.

700
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:15,280
But in essence, when you have one over the other, you have conflict and resentment.

701
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,500
But when you both agree these are the rules that we live by, then sometimes when something

702
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,260
happens that's in question, you go to the rules and it favors one.

703
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,900
And other times, it favors the other.

704
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,760
It's never always the husband says what goes on or the wife.

705
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,880
Also, if you're familiar with Latin cultures, especially South America, it's grandma,

706
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,920
abuelita or abuela that makes the final say, right?

707
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,700
You know what I mean?

708
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,560
You might have seen that back east.

709
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,920
And to tell you the truth, Italians kind of function the same way too, certain ones

710
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,840
from certain regions.

711
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,720
The grandma.

712
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,840
Not all Italians because Italy, remember, is a fabricated country.

713
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,680
But I will say that amongst Sicilians, that's true also.

714
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,160
Now, when you go out – that's within the home.

715
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,340
Now, outside of the home, there's a difference.

716
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,600
But these things are generally accepted.

717
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,700
Cultural.

718
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,700
They're cultural.

719
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,800
And I would consider them or have always spoken of them as roles, to be honest with you,

720
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,100
is that depending on a situation, there's a role.

721
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,780
Well, a situation is cultural.

722
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,160
And what I'm trying to emphasize here is that when you do have an objectified set of

723
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,000
rules, it doesn't work that you go to one person.

724
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,220
You look at the agreements that you've made.

725
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,780
And like, for example, personally with my wife, sometimes something will happen before

726
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,040
an argument or conflict ensues.

727
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,980
We say, well, what does it say here?

728
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,360
We're Old Testament people.

729
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,900
Well, sometimes it favors her and I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I fucked up, right?

730
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,380
I'll admit it.

731
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,340
There's no arguing.

732
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,460
It's pretty simple.

733
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,860
It's written on a fourth – an eight-year-old can understand it.

734
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,660
And sometimes she messes up.

735
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,500
You see how it works?

736
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,120
It's not like the certain cultures, right?

737
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,440
So this is another problem that people have, what culture they come from and so on.

738
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,640
Okay, so again, I have not – you know, I'm giving a lot of background.

739
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,620
Where is he going with this, right?

740
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,380
Where is he – he still hasn't said how we pick a mate or a spouse, right?

741
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,920
No, I haven't because this is very important.

742
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,880
These things are very important to consider personally before you go on the endeavor of

743
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,960
how do you pick one because how you find a spouse is very easy and very simple.

744
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,900
But it's not easy and I'm getting into why it's not easy before I say how to meet one.

745
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,080
No.

746
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,400
Okay, let's just jump to the point and maybe we'll give a little more background on what

747
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:43,940
I've discovered.

748
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,640
Okay, so finding a spouse or a mate, first thing is physical appearance.

749
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,100
What I'm trying to say here, ultimately it doesn't matter who it is.

750
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,780
Are they trainable?

751
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,680
But with physical appearance or when I say by trainable, I mean are they willing to accept

752
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,500
what I just mentioned?

753
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,620
You know, a neutral objective set of rules that you both live by.

754
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,560
Not you will do what you say or you will do what she says or he says.

755
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,280
You see?

756
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,660
Okay, so once you discover that that is an objective and the best way to go when you

757
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,500
have a neutral set of rules or laws that you will live by, it's a physical appearance thing.

758
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:33,720
So if you, for example, like someone with small feet, don't go pick – to cultivate

759
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,940
a relationship with someone who has big feet because that's kind of hard to change, right?

760
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,160
You see what I mean?

761
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:50,640
It could be height, foot size, color of skin, sound of their voice, their nose shape, the

762
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,360
cut of their jib, right?

763
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,140
That's the way their grill looks, right?

764
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,680
Their face.

765
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,880
Their natural scent.

766
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,660
Their natural scent is a thing too, I'll tell you that.

767
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,800
But that changes.

768
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,080
I'm glad you brought that up.

769
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,940
Would you remember to bring that up again further on the conversation because that's

770
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,580
very important.

771
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,560
Yes, yes, of course.

772
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,020
And how it's not empirical.

773
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:09,620
It changes.

774
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,360
In the beginning, okay, well, yeah, okay.

775
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,480
No problem.

776
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,560
We'll get to that later.

777
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,720
But I mean eye color, hair color, all these things.

778
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,480
All those things can't change that easily.

779
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,280
In other words, you could run into someone who has no clue of what they're doing.

780
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,400
They run their life based on what they show on sitcom television.

781
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,620
If they're physically not, it's not to find someone who is physically attractive, but to

782
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,620
find someone who is not physically repulsive to you.

783
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,140
That you are not repulsed by.

784
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,640
Don't worry about finding someone that's attractive.

785
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,700
Oh, that person's attractive.

786
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,700
No, find someone that doesn't have things that are repulsive to you.

787
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,840
Look, a really good objective sort of thing is freckles, right?

788
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,280
Let's just say somebody absolutely despises the look of freckles for some reason, then

789
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,180
yeah, don't bother.

790
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,520
But those are easy.

791
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,660
I think they charge a dollar a freckle, literally.

792
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,540
They hit them off with a laser and they charge you a dollar per shot.

793
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,920
Yeah, well, for some people that could be.

794
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,720
So you gotta count the freckles.

795
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,260
For some people it would be easier to buy a house, you know, depending on how many freckles

796
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,800
they got, right?

797
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,720
But you've seen people that almost-

798
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,340
My wife has red hair and freckles.

799
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,140
There you go.

800
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,420
So safety second, you know what I mean?

801
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,840
Okay, look, if you're happy.

802
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,060
That's safety first, yeah.

803
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,840
Oh, yeah.

804
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,740
Well, happiness is not something that, if you've attained happiness, you're done.

805
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,900
It's something that constantly is happening.

806
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,300
It's an aorist.

807
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,200
An aorist is a grammatical mechanism where it's something that's constantly going, you

808
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,340
know?

809
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,840
It's not like the water came out of, you know, you got water that ran through your

810
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,140
pipes.

811
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,580
You got water running through your pipes.

812
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,840
You see the difference?

813
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,420
It's constant.

814
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,780
So, but anyway, yeah, we got off on that.

815
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,120
Yeah, but what's more important than finding someone who is attractive, because remember

816
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,140
if they spike you as being attractive or you're falling in love, that's very high on the

817
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,100
curve, and that curve is going to come down and normalize.

818
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,600
You want to start low on the curve and build up.

819
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,260
So the main thing is when I see people, even throughout my whole life, like, oh, I don't

820
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,100
find them attractive.

821
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,080
Well, you just met them.

822
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,660
You just saw them like a minute ago.

823
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,720
What do you mean you don't find-

824
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,660
Well, I say, do you see anything on them that is repulsive to you?

825
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,840
I say repulsive is a strong word, but it just means to repel, you know?

826
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,160
Just like when you see something that you don't like, so I don't want to look at that,

827
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:24,380
right?

828
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,760
That's a repulsive reaction.

829
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,000
Well, maybe there's a better word for that then, because to be repulsed, to be repelled,

830
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,220
I mean, because I hear the word repel, repulse.

831
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,480
It's a strong word.

832
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,620
It's fairly strong.

833
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,660
I mean, it could just be something that's undesirable.

834
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Yeah, undesirable, but I would take it as a strong thing because if it's something undesirable

835
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,060
and it's minor, it's minor, it might escalate to something like with regret later, so I'm

836
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:55,220
saying if anything, even if it's undesirable, stay away if you're not the type of person

837
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,000
that would compensate for it, right?

838
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,760
And it is, it can be compensated for, but again, there's a general, certain proclivity

839
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,560
that people have.

840
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm not talking about fetishes, but some people don't, I personally don't like women with

841
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,800
big feet.

842
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,860
I find them to be cruel.

843
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm sorry.

844
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,740
It's a phrenological thing, generally.

845
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,940
No matter how nice they seem on the surface, you get to know them and they're pretty cruel.

846
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,360
Sorry.

847
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,360
This is actually, I felt happy when I read about this in some 17th century literature.

848
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,720
I didn't know that that existed in 17th century literature, but I got to tell you, I concur

849
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,600
with you.

850
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,200
Yeah, okay.

851
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,020
Yeah, that there's an odd thing to, no, listen, I just want to pause for a second.

852
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,260
There is an odd thing with women with big feet.

853
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,120
They are not like over a size, like an American size.

854
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,120
If you've got a woman with over a size nine, forget it.

855
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,580
She's Sasquatch.

856
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:46,860
Yeah.

857
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,600
She's not.

858
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,220
Yeah.

859
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,280
She's not kind.

860
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,560
She's not pleasant.

861
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,480
She might be very much on the surface.

862
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,680
She might be a great stewardess or a great waitress or a great philanthropist.

863
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,040
No, but to me, to me, to actually interact with them, I don't find them pleasant.

864
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,580
Yeah.

865
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,160
Okay.

866
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,820
And it's consistent.

867
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,640
I'm sorry.

868
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,980
I just never heard that from anybody else before.

869
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,960
No, no, it's fine because we can, you know, there's so many parts of the body on both

870
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,940
sides we could discuss, but that's not the point.

871
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,080
The point is this is a, how do you feel?

872
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,860
Everyone's got their own personal filter is what I'm trying to say.

873
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,380
Oh yeah.

874
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:19,700
Maybe.

875
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,140
You have to figure out what your personal filters are.

876
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:22,720
Okay.

877
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,140
So in short, up until this point, when you're looking for a mate, a husband or a wife, pick

878
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:36,360
someone and literally someone, anyone, as long as they're not, they don't have features

879
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,260
that you don't like.

880
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:37,940
How about that?

881
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,240
That's better than being repulsive.

882
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:39,780
There you go.

883
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay.

884
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,640
All right.

885
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,840
Features that you don't like.

886
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,360
And also age might be a consideration to a certain degree, to a certain degree.

887
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,380
Okay.

888
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,260
So once you've gotten that step, that's very simple.

889
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:50,860
Right.

890
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,120
And it's materialistic.

891
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,720
Yes, it is.

892
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,640
But these things matter.

893
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,700
Eventually you're going to get to the more important thing, which is in order to have

894
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,260
harmony, you have to both live by similar covenant or set of laws.

895
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,000
So hopefully if you're listening to me, you've established that already within your own life

896
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,880
through a form of discipline.

897
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,560
You know how some people say, well, I needed to go to the military to learn discipline,

898
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:14,880
right?

899
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,060
It's like, oh man, you went through all that bullshit just to learn discipline so you get

900
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,280
up, that you couldn't get yourself to get up exactly the same time every day or comb

901
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,660
your hair or do this or do that.

902
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:24,960
Wow.

903
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,580
Some people need that, right?

904
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,500
If you're one of those, fine.

905
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,220
But if you're not, you should be able to figure out what kind of a discipline and set of rules

906
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:34,740
you live by.

907
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:42,660
The question now is once you've targeted someone, are they trainable or do they happen to have

908
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,400
the same rules?

909
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,540
Well, see, I was just going to ask a question there because, look, because somebody doesn't

910
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,780
have the same rules when you meet them.

911
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,300
Here's the thing.

912
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,520
Sometimes you enlighten them about something and they change, right?

913
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,840
So, okay, let's go with a simple thing.

914
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,660
Dietary habits.

915
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,960
It's very important, actually, that you're able to eat similar things, okay?

916
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,700
Let's go with a harsh one, right?

917
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:17,020
If you did not have a mate currently and you were searching for one, you find one who doesn't

918
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,360
have a problem with eating pork.

919
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,040
Okay, maybe you explain some things to them and they change their mind about that and

920
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,700
say, you know what?

921
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,440
I don't want to do that anymore.

922
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,980
There are certain things that could change.

923
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,020
Behaviors, right?

924
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,220
Yeah.

925
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,700
Well, this is more in line of how you make, what you're really finding is the physical

926
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,280
features.

927
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,460
The rest of it you have to make.

928
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,260
You see the difference?

929
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,720
In other words, there's a certain amount of, okay, this is what dating and courting is

930
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,020
about.

931
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,900
People go on a date.

932
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,000
They go all the way from, oh, did you score on the first date all the way to we've been

933
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,780
dating for six months and it's not going anywhere, right?

934
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,060
Okay, this is not what I'm talking about.

935
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,520
The purpose of courting and dating is to get to know each other, but not like what you

936
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,340
saw on TV and what you think about this, but what do you think about this, meaning proposal

937
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,700
time, right?

938
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,260
When you go into a business meeting and whether it's negotiations, right?

939
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,980
One side makes the proposal of the offering.

940
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,960
The other one either accepts or counters it, right, with conditions.

941
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,180
Or they just say, throw up their hands, say, hell no, and walk out.

942
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,100
You see what I mean?

943
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,480
There's many ways any business meeting can go.

944
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:34,220
The purpose of dating and courting is not to sit down and watch movies and eat popcorn

945
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,360
and then kiss each other or whatever and leave.

946
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,620
The purpose more dating, what was it?

947
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,680
You went out to dinner, right?

948
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,800
So what are you going to talk about when you go to dinner?

949
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,320
What you saw on TV?

950
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,200
What your grandmother did?

951
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,560
No one cares about that.

952
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:53,760
The purpose of courting and dating is to make proposals and offers and negotiate the rest

953
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
of your lives together.

954
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,440
Hello?

955
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,920
Do you see how down bare bones and how hard what I just said is and should be done by

956
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,320
everyone from a young age?

957
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:02,780
All right.

958
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,700
Well, this is to explore also where they're at regarding their way of conducting business

959
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,660
or they're conducting their lives, right?

960
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,040
Yeah, but keep it simple.

961
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,300
You could find that there are certain behaviors that are entirely repulsive and completely

962
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,540
unacceptable, right?

963
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,260
Right, but the behavior is changeable unless they were raised by gorillas.

964
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,400
Well, most likely, but there are certain people that you'll find will not change from their

965
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:28,820
patterns.

966
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,440
I'll give you a common break point, right?

967
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,980
Somebody's consumption of alcohol, which you can learn by going out to dinner with them.

968
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,800
Okay, you might find it acceptable to have a couple of drinks with dinner.

969
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,820
This is perfectly fine.

970
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,940
Maybe somebody else drinks a little more than that.

971
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,620
Yeah, I've been on quote-unquote dates many moons ago where we've had four bottles of

972
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:52,860
wine.

973
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,400
I had one glass out of the four bottles of wine.

974
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,460
I was like, this is a little too much, right?

975
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,160
Right, right.

976
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,720
That's an excessive.

977
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,020
So, okay, those things, the behaviors are changeable.

978
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,200
It depends, again, on the maturity of the individual that you're dealing with.

979
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,820
Do you remember the analogy I gave when someone says, well, I'm not technical?

980
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,080
That's because at a young age, someone respected around them said, I'm not technical, and they

981
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,260
just latched onto that thought.

982
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,420
I could be lazy now.

983
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,040
Okay.

984
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,180
So, when something technical comes up, I don't have to ever learn anything.

985
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,480
I could just say, I'm not technical, and people accept it.

986
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,200
The person who has a behavioral quote-unquote or resists behavioral adjustment, you know

987
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,820
I was going to say behavioral flaw, right?

988
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,900
But there is none, right?

989
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,500
Depending on the culture, right?

990
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,000
Right.

991
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:44,260
So, if someone resists a behavioral adjustment, I would suggest that a strong reason they

992
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,280
resist it is because at a very young age, usually formative years, which is less than

993
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,860
nine years old, they had seen someone that attended either a family gathering or within

994
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:59,780
their house or out, that someone was generally respected, made a comment about something,

995
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:05,200
and everyone found it to be acceptable, and that child or yourself also found it to be

996
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,940
acceptable as something that you're going to attach to as part of the conduct for the

997
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,740
rest of your life.

998
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,580
You forget that moment.

999
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,060
This thought that I brought up that you're going to attach to what someone said when

1000
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,580
you were a child observing them because they were still respected when they said it, that

1001
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,780
contemplation as a child only could be like a third of a second.

1002
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,520
It may not even be quote-unquote conscious to you that you just did that, right?

1003
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:29,920
Right.

1004
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:30,860
You see?

1005
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,700
Like, again, I'll repeat myself.

1006
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,020
There was a receptionist regarding some technical stuff that I was proposing to an Internet

1007
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,560
person.

1008
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,080
It has to do with sound, and I wanted to bring up this has to do with such and such, and

1009
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,720
it sounded technical, and the receptionist says, I'm not technical.

1010
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,220
And I said, well, can we get personal here for a moment?

1011
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,280
And I just broke it down.

1012
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,380
I said, at some point in your young youth, you saw your aunt or someone else, your mom

1013
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,460
or a friend of the family say, I'm not technical, and it was applauded or accepted, and you

1014
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,160
just said to yourself as a child, if I say I'm not technical, it'll be accepted.

1015
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,980
So, I don't have to expand in that area ever, even though I have the capability, let's say.

1016
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,540
I mean, they don't know that, whether you know it or not.

1017
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,460
So, I could spend the rest of my life now saying, I'm not technical, and people will

1018
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,300
say, that's fine.

1019
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,820
You see?

1020
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,280
So, when people say, I don't do that, or I don't, you know, that's not how I do it, right?

1021
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,100
Or I'm not, whatever.

1022
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:33,480
I'm telling you, 99.999% of the time, because of what we know about unlimited capability

1023
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,220
of most humans, 99% of the time, that's something that someone saw as a very young

1024
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:44,820
child that was impressed upon them as being acceptable, and now they held this for the

1025
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,480
rest of their lives.

1026
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,000
It's a form of laziness, by the way, right?

1027
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,640
Let me just go to another sense.

1028
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,620
Have you ever heard of people that when they get stressed out, they have to eat a big

1029
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,340
chocolate cake?

1030
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,320
Not a piece of chocolate cake, but the whole chocolate cake, right?

1031
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,800
They run to the fridge to eat sweets.

1032
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,820
Yeah, there are people that react to stressful situations, and then, yeah, that's one of

1033
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,700
the things they do.

1034
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,440
Right.

1035
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,060
Or whatever.

1036
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,920
Yeah, they think, okay, this is very similar to that, but it's purely mental versus having

1037
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,560
to get a substance when you got stressed out or confronted with a situation.

1038
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,140
Because if you've been saying, you're not a technical, or you're not good at math, is

1039
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:21,680
another one.

1040
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,540
You hear that very popularly.

1041
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:23,980
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,700
Because, again, someone was very young, and someone said, I'm not good at math, and your

1043
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,900
mom and dad, or whoever was around you, in Aramaic, it's called a gawra, which is your

1044
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,860
guardian, said, that's okay.

1045
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,380
And you said, oh, I know that in my mind, someday I'm going to have to learn math, but

1046
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,040
this person got away with saying that they don't do math.

1047
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,640
If I do that, I'll get away with all that extra time I have to think about math.

1048
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,720
Wow, what a great, as a child, you don't think that way, but it happens.

1049
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,740
It's interesting, right?

1050
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:56,960
So, these things exist also, and those are extremely difficult, because it took .3 seconds

1051
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,680
to be embedded in the mind of a child, and what makes it even more difficult is the people

1052
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,200
that are saying these things, I'm not good at math, I'm not technical, or whatever, or

1053
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,060
I'm not good at cleaning.

1054
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,700
Pick any subject, right?

1055
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,280
It's usually in the negative.

1056
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,900
They don't know that they've embedded that, right?

1057
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,660
They don't know that they've embedded that.

1058
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,500
What I think about, is the analogy I give with this, is the CIA has this umbrella gun.

1059
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,980
If they want to off someone, they have a gun built into an umbrella.

1060
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:32,320
It's a very tiny pellet with the poison of one of these snakes, I forgot, this was back

1061
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,440
in the day, and when the person is in a crowded place, they trip over them, like really push

1062
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,280
them down, and they shoot the umbrella into their, usually the leg, the pellet into their

1063
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,900
leg, and you just feel a little sting.

1064
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:50,020
Yeah, at one point they had a toxin from a fish in the cartridge, but yeah.

1065
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,460
Right, so you'll feel the bump of someone almost knocking you over more than the sting

1066
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,460
in the leg, right?

1067
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,800
So, in other words, it's a distraction maneuver, kind of like when your pickpockets use this

1068
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:10,260
a lot, they'll nearly knock someone over to take their wallet, and the person turns around

1069
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,260
and you're like, what kind of a person did that, you know, pushed me over so hard, and

1070
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,540
you see it's a pregnant woman, right?

1071
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,020
Well, it's a woman wearing a thing like she's pregnant, and no one's going to get mad at

1072
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,940
a woman who looks like she's eight or nine months gestation, right?

1073
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,900
Instead of calling her out or whatever, you'll say, just be careful next time, you won't

1074
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,740
get too mad, right?

1075
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:34,920
So these things are hidden that way in a very, very deep, let's say, cultural, quote-unquote

1076
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,020
spiritual sense.

1077
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,340
So we can get into a very lengthy sonic on all the various attributes that people carry

1078
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:51,260
with them their whole lives that you will confront on a quote-unquote courting or dating

1079
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,380
scene to figure out if they're trainable or whatever, you see?

1080
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,320
So this is, I just wanted to give, those things that I mentioned were kind of in-depth and

1081
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,880
redundant, I've mentioned them before, but they are very important because you can branch

1082
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,060
off from there how it goes.

1083
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,380
But essentially, finding a mate or a wife or a husband is simple.

1084
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,140
Very much, someone who doesn't have features that you don't like, they don't necessarily

1085
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,200
have to be attractive, right?

1086
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,440
Because you're going to start high and then you're going to go low, so you want to start

1087
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,360
low and build up and go high, right?

1088
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,060
So, right?

1089
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:27,940
So...

1090
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,180
They just can't be automatically negative to you.

1091
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,260
That's the problem.

1092
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,760
That's right, automatically negative.

1093
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,640
It's very rare that turns around also, by the way.

1094
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,800
This is not in partnership relationships, but general acquaintances, people that are

1095
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,560
called friends.

1096
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,080
I had several times run into people that we just didn't hit it off the first 0.3 seconds

1097
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,000
and then later on we met again and became close.

1098
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,680
You see what I mean?

1099
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,360
We're not talking about partners here, we're just general associates, let's say.

1100
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,000
That's happened.

1101
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,300
It is possible that this could happen also in this situation.

1102
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,920
You might approach someone or not, or they might approach you, or you might happen to

1103
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,480
be in a situation where you quote-unquote hate each other, but within a little more

1104
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,060
exposure that flips and becomes the opposite.

1105
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,180
You see, that's possible.

1106
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,920
I've seen it.

1107
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,980
Well, thinking about it very carefully, I had a second wife who, frankly, initially,

1108
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,280
there was nothing negative about her.

1109
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,000
In fact, there was some things there that, you know, look, I'm not going to list the

1110
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,640
physical attributes, but there were physical attributes there that weren't necessarily,

1111
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:43,260
okay, that's the greatest thing off the bat, but frankly, because it wasn't negative,

1112
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:49,440
I kind of grew to appreciate certain things about her as I got to know her.

1113
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,760
So, this makes perfect sense with what you're saying.

1114
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,180
Mm-hmm.

1115
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:54,960
Mm-hmm.

1116
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,880
Well, there is no perfect sense in the sense that this is going to be easy.

1117
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,880
What I'd like to do is give the general landscape, and to summarize, let's say, to some summary,

1118
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,660
it could be anyone.

1119
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,220
How do you pick a spouse or a mate?

1120
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:10,880
It could be anyone.

1121
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,680
Well, I'm just saying I grew to appreciate things that weren't necessarily right off

1122
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,940
the bat.

1123
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,040
Wow, that's great, you know, about her.

1124
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,100
And I sort of, like I said, started to appreciate.

1125
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,860
She had some of those things that I thought were great to begin with, but there were some

1126
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:27,300
things there that were kind of like, eh, okay, that is what it is, but it wasn't negative.

1127
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,120
Right.

1128
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,240
And it doesn't mean also that you can't have that attraction in the beginning.

1129
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:37,260
Like, good soul history, like for many years in my life, I was attracting the supermodel

1130
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,080
types.

1131
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,200
They were coming after me.

1132
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:40,860
Right.

1133
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,740
And I was like, oh, great, I'm set for life.

1134
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:43,860
Right?

1135
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,420
And I was like, no, it never lasted more than a year.

1136
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:49,400
Right?

1137
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,980
This is in the past, let's say.

1138
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:57,880
So I could say strictly that the attraction, either way, whether I was going after them

1139
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,920
or they didn't matter, I was hitching up with supermodel types.

1140
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,640
You know what I mean?

1141
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,660
But I'm not exaggerating.

1142
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:08,540
And it just didn't work out, but it wasn't because they were supermodel types.

1143
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,860
It was because the rest didn't fill in.

1144
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,280
Right?

1145
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,440
And the rest is, how are you going to live?

1146
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,980
What rules are you going to live by?

1147
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,020
Right?

1148
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,000
This is what the training is.

1149
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:26,620
So, again, if you pick someone, and through conversation and courting, what is the typical,

1150
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,820
even that they show in Hollywood on TV?

1151
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,420
Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.

1152
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,580
Hi, what's your name?

1153
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,100
What are you doing later?

1154
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,860
Great.

1155
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,280
Okay, you're available?

1156
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,700
I'm not available tonight, I'm available tomorrow night.

1157
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,140
Okay, you meet and you order a bowl of soup at the cafe.

1158
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,740
What are you going to talk about?

1159
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,600
How do you bring up the subject?

1160
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,260
Well, I'm the type of person now that brings it up right away.

1161
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,380
So what covenant, what rules do you live by?

1162
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,240
Are you religious?

1163
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:54,460
Right?

1164
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,060
What's your view on the way things are in society?

1165
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,500
Is a more roundabout, indirect way, right?

1166
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,260
If you run into someone, you ordered your soup, you know, you've had only two minutes

1167
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,300
of contact, they agree to go on a date with you, instead of getting very direct.

1168
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,760
If you say, what do you think of what's, I'm not political, but what do you think about

1169
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,140
the society we live in?

1170
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,780
If they say, well, I'm quite happy with it, everything's going great, we just have to

1171
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,860
work a few things out, that's a 50-50 point.

1172
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,100
But if they say everything's going well, chances are, unless you're part of the collective,

1173
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:30,480
right?

1174
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,100
Right.

1175
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:37,480
You see, if they bring up political stuff or religious, meaning conventional religion

1176
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,840
or stuff, chances went down really fast.

1177
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,340
But if the people, see, if you're not part of the collective, it doesn't matter if you're

1178
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,660
living now or 2,000 years ago, you're never going to be happy with the collective.

1179
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,860
So you create your own life, your own world within your own household.

1180
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,740
So there's many ways.

1181
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,300
So here's the point.

1182
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,580
Boy meets girl, girl, you know, you're in the apartment building or on the street, you

1183
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:06,540
know, you're not going to ask someone out on a date if they have physical features that

1184
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,200
you find not accommodating to your desires, okay?

1185
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:18,100
So once you get past that point, you see, but the part that's not easy is what if you

1186
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:22,660
run into someone that has physical features that you don't like, but is very ready and

1187
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:27,700
willing and immediately comes pre-downloaded, preloaded with the rules that you want to

1188
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,340
live with, right?

1189
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,560
What do you do then?

1190
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:37,780
See, now that sounds on the face of it like, oh, well, just get accustomed to the, you

1191
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,200
know, but I got to be honest with you.

1192
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,720
I don't think it works that way.

1193
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,900
No, it's going to be, it's going to be the reason why, yeah, you said it's not going

1194
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,400
to work that way.

1195
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:46,700
Why?

1196
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,340
Because those are things don't change.

1197
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:53,280
Where if you run into someone, let's say who is either attractive or doesn't have

1198
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,300
things that you don't like, the attitude and the behavior is changeable.

1199
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,120
A lot of it is, yeah.

1200
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,280
Yeah, most of it.

1201
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,920
But the hardest part, again, if you find you meet someone and they have things,

1202
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,260
attributes that are not changeable and they're not addressing them and telling you there's

1203
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,340
a 99% chance that it goes back to their formative years, right?

1204
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:24,480
Like we mentioned earlier, they attach to some kind of, they got, they fell for some

1205
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,580
kind of bug or a virus.

1206
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,400
It's okay to be that way.

1207
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,300
You see?

1208
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,220
You know what I mean?

1209
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:32,880
That's a very important one and those are the most difficult ones to address.

1210
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:33,840
Well, right.

1211
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,220
And the interesting thing here though is that, and I always, I have tried to advise others

1212
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:44,480
about this, you know, this concept of, well, this is the kind of person they are and, you

1213
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,520
know, you can't change people.

1214
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,540
And I go, well, look, okay, fine.

1215
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,040
Forget about your ability to change somebody.

1216
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:57,000
Here's a reality that a lot of people don't consider when they're in their twenties and

1217
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,960
their thirties, especially no one that I know who was in their twenties is the same person

1218
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,640
when they reach the age of 40.

1219
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,520
Uh, you're, you're different just based on different things you've been exposed to in

1220
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,240
your experiences.

1221
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:19,420
If you are exactly the same at the age of 22 as you are at 42, uh, I, I, I don't know

1222
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,020
what planet you're from because I don't think that's even possible.

1223
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,660
But, uh, well, I don't know.

1224
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:29,700
I don't want to go back and forth on this, but I've met 70 year old plus that are still

1225
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,520
that I could show you many ways how they did not mature past nine.

1226
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:39,780
So they, their visage in their appearance changes, but I'm telling you their brains

1227
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,640
are, uh, they stopped, uh, their voice gets deeper, but there's a little, it stopped growing

1228
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,860
at nine or 10 years old.

1229
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,800
Most people in society are like that.

1230
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,860
But it's not even necessarily about growth or maturity.

1231
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:53,300
I mean, there is no way that you maintain exactly.

1232
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,720
I mean, if you do, then, you know, I mean, that's very strange.

1233
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:57,520
Yeah.

1234
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,020
Well, and when you, as you get older, you have different needs physically.

1235
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:05,240
So, but I'm saying most people don't mature past a certain age, but no, no, the, the here's

1236
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:05,500
okay.

1237
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,300
But the age thing is, is another thing I like to counter.

1238
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,140
Very important.

1239
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:09,740
Sure.

1240
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,100
You have certain cultures where you have arranged marriages.

1241
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:17,520
And for example, my great grandparents married at 12 and 13 or 13 and 14 years old respectively.

1242
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,700
I think, uh, the grandma was a year older, which was bizarre because usually it goes the

1243
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,680
other way around, right?

1244
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,840
Um, uh, for late 1800s.

1245
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:32,740
Um, and the grandparents also married around 15 and 16 arranged what's, what's cool about

1246
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,820
an arranged marriage.

1247
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,960
It's usually when there's a confined culture, right?

1248
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,540
You're not going to have an arranged marriage with someone that's from Pakistan or someone

1249
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,320
who's in France.

1250
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,200
You're usually going to have it within a Pakistani village, right?

1251
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,820
A place where most people don't travel more than 20 miles from where they were born.

1252
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,160
You know what I mean?

1253
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:51,440
Right.

1254
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,940
So the likelihood is that the covenant that they live by, the agreement.

1255
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,160
It's already established.

1256
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,320
It's already established.

1257
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,340
So that's kind of the good thing about it if they have maintained connection to their culture,

1258
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,000
right?

1259
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,140
If they haven't traveled more than 20 miles from the village that they were born.

1260
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,400
Right.

1261
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,020
Okay.

1262
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:07,820
Today.

1263
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,520
But now with the smartphones, it's different to a certain extent.

1264
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,300
The stupid rectangle.

1265
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:17,320
But, but here's the, here's the interesting thing about that is that the, the divorce

1266
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,440
rate is almost zero.

1267
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,960
What the range matter marriages.

1268
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,060
And I'm not talking about dishonor.

1269
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,240
You set your wife on fire or kill your husband because he dishonored you and wants to leave.

1270
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,480
Right?

1271
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:26,860
No, no, no.

1272
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:27,880
Yeah.

1273
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,760
We're talking about a range.

1274
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,220
There was the concept of divorce was not a concept.

1275
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,220
It was heard of, but not unheard of in terms of practice.

1276
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:35,520
Right.

1277
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,400
Right.

1278
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,440
So this, what I'm doing is going back to what works.

1279
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:39,720
Okay.

1280
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:45,800
So if you're going to hook up with someone for the rest of your life, divorce is not

1281
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,960
an option because if divorce was an option, why would you consider hooking up with them

1282
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,220
for the rest of your life?

1283
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:51,700
You see?

1284
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,360
So when you hook up someone the rest of your life, it's permanent, literally permanent,

1285
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,780
you know, as long as you're alive.

1286
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:03,960
So we don't need to reinvent the wheel because we can examine the idea that arranged marriages

1287
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,780
have rarely have divorces.

1288
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,520
What is, what do arranged marriages have in common?

1289
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,920
Well, the people usually don't travel more than 20 or 50 miles from when they were born.

1290
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,880
They have a set culture.

1291
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,940
That's all they know.

1292
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,020
It doesn't mean they're ignorant by the way.

1293
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:18,900
Right.

1294
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,400
And that's, they don't know any other thing to apply to themselves.

1295
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,800
So for example, we sound like we're talking about the, by definition, you know, what's

1296
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,840
called a pagan culture.

1297
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,880
You know, they live off the land and all this, right?

1298
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,940
The ancients, they called them pagans or whatever.

1299
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:34,760
The peasant culture.

1300
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,800
That might hearken back to more what's considered ignorant, but not necessarily.

1301
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:47,160
But just because you have that rigid structure, which could allow freedom within its rules

1302
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,660
by the way, it doesn't mean you're ignorant.

1303
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,440
You see?

1304
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,580
This is another thing that's important.

1305
01:07:54,180 --> 01:08:00,140
Because if you, let's say, have a successful relationship by picking someone, and then

1306
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,680
both of you through the courting and dating decide on a set of rules to live by.

1307
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,720
And by the way, you can even make up these rules, but I don't suggest you do that.

1308
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,040
If you have a difference with the culture, the core culture, and the two of you agree

1309
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,740
upon it, let's just go with the Pakistani ideal where, you know, maybe alcohol is something

1310
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,160
you're not supposed to drink culturally, right?

1311
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,000
Among your village there.

1312
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,500
But the two of you who are living in a slightly different place agree, listen, you know what?

1313
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:35,100
We can have some alcohol here as long as it's, you know, okay, the bottle of wine.

1314
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,399
Modified.

1315
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,740
You can modify it based on a mutual desire to modify it as long as it's mutual, right?

1316
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:43,560
Yep.

1317
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:47,960
So again, you notice what we're leaning on heavily is all agreement and what rules you

1318
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,700
live by and not what he says or she says.

1319
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:54,000
Now, sometimes there is a dominant factor, right?

1320
01:08:54,340 --> 01:09:00,520
But it's not dominant the way that we consider dominant, you know, just because I said so.

1321
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,479
No, it still goes back to the rules, right?

1322
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,880
So like a final say.

1323
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,420
You know, like for example, in government, who has the final say to a quote unquote bill?

1324
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:11,160
It goes to the chief executive officer, right?

1325
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:11,460
Right.

1326
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,560
The president, right?

1327
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,100
Right.

1328
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,859
No matter how, no matter what the dynamics are within the various houses of government

1329
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:23,180
or whatever, when it, by the time it gets for the chief executive officer to sign it,

1330
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,859
it's might as well, it's finished, right?

1331
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:28,520
So there are things like that, too, in personal relationships, but.

1332
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,279
Well, fair enough.

1333
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,580
But you also told me to put a pin in this concept of the scent, the smell.

1334
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:34,680
Yeah, the pheromone.

1335
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:35,340
The pheromone.

1336
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,899
True scents and smells are not sensory like, you know, one smells like roses or chocolate

1337
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:42,620
or whatever.

1338
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:50,399
There's a pheromone that one will pick up with a partner that after they've been together

1339
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,700
for a long time, long time could be anywhere between six months to five years, you end

1340
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:01,480
up finding that person even more attractive because their pheromone, now your body chemistry

1341
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:07,700
and all these other things have adjusted where you find pleasure with being them, not

1342
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,200
just because you're comfortable with being with them because of your experiences and

1343
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,540
time, but the actual, their smell.

1344
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,080
But it's not a direct olfactory.

1345
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:22,300
What I'm trying to say about this is you might meet someone in the beginning as you're going

1346
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:27,980
through this courting process and you may not find their smell pleasant, like a bouquet

1347
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,480
of roses.

1348
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,460
You may not find it offensive either.

1349
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,420
You just notice there's a smell there, right?

1350
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:32,820
Right.

1351
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,600
What will happen is after you spend enough time together, that scent will go away that

1352
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:46,920
you sense overtly and you won't sense it anymore and you will find more comfort with

1353
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,060
that person because now they've switched their body chemistry to yours.

1354
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,920
The two have come together and you each are giving off a complimentary pheromone that

1355
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,100
actually makes each other comfortable within the proximity.

1356
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,020
It's very interesting how that works.

1357
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,800
Anyone who's had the experience of being with someone long enough might remember how

1358
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:11,200
they perceived their smell in the beginning and as time went on that you didn't perceive

1359
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,760
it anymore, but you found you enjoy spending time with them.

1360
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,300
I'm telling you that scent changed.

1361
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,780
Now it goes into the pheromone status, which is you cannot smell it, right?

1362
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,700
It's almost, you know, it's like there's a non-visible light that's still measurable,

1363
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,300
right?

1364
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:30,100
Or non-audible sounds that are still measurable, right?

1365
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:35,000
Like a dog can hear a certain pitch that we can't, right?

1366
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,920
It's in that level.

1367
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,820
We can't describe what it smells like.

1368
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:38,560
It's just there.

1369
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,260
It's a very interesting thing that happens.

1370
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,560
There's some studies on it also, by the way, if you want to spend time on it.

1371
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:51,260
So what I'm saying is the two, after spending enough time together, it's not just physical

1372
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,840
time like you're inmates in a cell, but you actually desire time together in that partnership

1373
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,300
mentality or idea of forming a partnership.

1374
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:06,140
Your essence, your smell that you give off will change and become pleasant to each other

1375
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,680
over time.

1376
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:13,260
So what this is, is if in the beginning you don't find it pleasant, if it's offensive,

1377
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,260
it's something that might be what someone has in their diet, by the way.

1378
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,200
But it will change and become positive almost every time.

1379
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:28,160
By the way, the diet has a big, since we're on the smell thing, I've met people that

1380
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,080
were in the military here and they go to Korea, they're stationed in Korea, and the

1381
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,000
first week they have a really hard time because everybody smells like fish and onions everywhere

1382
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,740
you go, right?

1383
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,000
Well, and after a week or so you don't sense it anymore, but when they come back to the

1384
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,060
U.S., all their family members and friends are saying, now you smell like fish and onions,

1385
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:47,260
right?

1386
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,000
Right, right.

1387
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,500
So until you change again.

1388
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,780
So part of it could be geography.

1389
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,460
I just want to, thanks for bringing that up, having that pinned, because that's an important,

1390
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:02,780
I went over it kind of quickly, but I assure you, you will actually experience physical,

1391
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,140
physiological changes when it comes to quote-unquote olfactory stuff.

1392
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,580
You're with someone.

1393
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:08,800
Yeah, definitely.

1394
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,920
So I don't know how else to sum it up other than repeating myself.

1395
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:18,960
In essence, you pick someone, or they may pick you, and then it's about deciding how you're

1396
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,400
going to live.

1397
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,720
Now how, okay, let's just give a personal example.

1398
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,180
My wife and I, we're Old Testament type people, okay?

1399
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,920
Not religious, and we don't go to church or synagogue or anything, because people want

1400
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,200
to pin you into these pigeonholes, right?

1401
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,500
It's just a set of rules that I live by, because it covers, it's such old and tried and true.

1402
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,140
Old and tried and true for me is more than 100 years old, right?

1403
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:43,920
Okay.

1404
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,420
So what to eat, what to wear, how to keep time, all these things.

1405
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,340
How do you engage in business?

1406
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,960
How do you engage with each other?

1407
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,300
All this stuff.

1408
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:01,180
If you don't understand what something is about, and your understanding is only from

1409
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:07,880
what is popularly perceived about it, right, you're going to have a problem figuring out

1410
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,580
what covenant or rules you want to live by.

1411
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,660
Because if you say you're an Old Testament, I've said this to several people, by the

1412
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:18,220
way, and these are academics, by the way, people that are book editors and scientists

1413
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:18,960
and doctors.

1414
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,060
I said, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy, and they said, oh, you're just like going

1415
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,260
around killing people, huh?

1416
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:26,780
You know?

1417
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,920
I'm like, huh?

1418
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,040
Where do you get that from?

1419
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,740
Because there was probably some commentary about, well, you know, the God of the Old

1420
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,460
Testament said, go and kill everyone, and that's all that stuck with them.

1421
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,700
Remember the little thing that's the impression that got stuck in the little child's mind,

1422
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:40,900
right?

1423
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,440
Right, right.

1424
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,120
Yeah, similar to that.

1425
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,540
Somebody once said it, and it was perceived as acceptable, and therefore they figured

1426
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,180
they could just say that, and therefore it's acceptable, yeah, okay.

1427
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:58,540
Yeah, so for example, you can look in any ancient text or any ancient culture, but if

1428
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:02,580
you start looking at what people say about it, you're going to be really far off the

1429
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,720
mark, right?

1430
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,960
Just like, again, with the body.

1431
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,500
You look at all the medical references.

1432
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,740
Disease is induced induction.

1433
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,240
It's not physical, right?

1434
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:21,420
But it has physical manifestations, okay, but the virus theory and the bacteria theory

1435
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:27,900
don't work, and what I want to say about that is that if you're making wine, cheese,

1436
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,420
fermented foods, yeah, bacteria and virus theory, well, bacteria is important, right?

1437
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:34,860
Right.

1438
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,980
You know, a cheap bottle, you know, okay, you understand fermentation.

1439
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,620
If you're dealing with that, yeah, bacteriology and all that stuff matters, but when you're

1440
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,960
dealing with human disease, no.

1441
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:51,600
See, and this is within their own reference manual, so what I'm trying to say is, on

1442
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,360
the face of it, what is popular is not true.

1443
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:02,060
So, yeah, and also being that most of the audience, I'm presuming, is of Western culture,

1444
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:08,200
which will have it, mostly, is, when I say Old Testament, yeah, it's the rules and

1445
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:14,360
laws that you see in there, and they're actually, maybe I've said this many times, I'll say

1446
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:22,540
it again, if something is not expressly prohibited, it's indirectly encouraged.

1447
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:23,700
Okay.

1448
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,180
Indirectly.

1449
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:31,660
So, in other words, if you find a set of 100 rules to live by, and let's say, well, let's

1450
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:38,260
say 500 or 600 rules, only 200 apply to you, and about 50 to 70 of them are prohibitions,

1451
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,920
like the acts, you know, that you shouldn't do, well, what are the possible amount of

1452
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,120
acts that one can perform or be engaged in in their life?

1453
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,000
Thousands?

1454
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:48,640
Millions?

1455
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,040
Right?

1456
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:49,540
Yeah, right.

1457
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:50,340
Billions?

1458
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:50,760
I don't know.

1459
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,420
Let's say in the millions, right?

1460
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,080
Your whole life.

1461
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:53,440
Sure.

1462
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,800
Well, if you only have 70 prohibitions or so, doesn't that give you a lot of freedom?

1463
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,320
Seems pretty good, yeah.

1464
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,620
I mean, if there's only 70 things you can't do, and there's millions of possibilities,

1465
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,600
or shouldn't do, yeah.

1466
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:10,060
Actually, if you break it down to less than 20, you see, where when you live in the legal

1467
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:16,660
system, what was okay to do now is not okay to do, and what was not okay to do now is

1468
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,200
okay, so where are you going with that?

1469
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:19,440
You see?

1470
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,340
Back and forth, right.

1471
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,980
Yeah, and yeah, it doesn't work, obviously.

1472
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,300
It's inconsistent, at best.

1473
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:26,940
Yeah.

1474
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:32,380
So I think we covered, basically, just pick any, in short, I used to tell people, just

1475
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:36,300
pick anyone, anyone, literally, and look, here's the thing.

1476
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,120
You need to practice, also.

1477
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:39,500
Right?

1478
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:47,160
It doesn't practice, and if it doesn't work out, don't you have, quote unquote, an acquaintance,

1479
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,360
an associate, possibly a friend, right?

1480
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:56,920
Or they might go around saying, avoid this guy, or this gal, because they're nuts, right?

1481
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,440
That's okay.

1482
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,680
You'll get something out of it.

1483
01:17:59,460 --> 01:17:59,960
Either way.

1484
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,460
But you see, this is very simple.

1485
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,520
Again, what does the collective, in short, tell you?

1486
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,720
We fell in love, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ends up, we divorced, it's totally normal.

1487
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:14,880
How many times have you heard, we fell in love, and we've been engaged six years now.

1488
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,380
We've been engaged 10 years now, right?

1489
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,040
Yeah, right.

1490
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,040
Then they get married, and two years later, we're having a divorce.

1491
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,920
Well, what?

1492
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,200
What did you do in between?

1493
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,100
Well, when you were engaged, when you were engaging, what was going on?

1494
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,860
Talking about what's on CNN, and eating chocolate cake?

1495
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,760
I always wonder that myself, when somebody's engaged for five years, but they only stay married for two.

1496
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,360
Yeah, it's common.

1497
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:39,980
It's very weird.

1498
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,060
Yeah, it's very common.

1499
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,880
Weird to me, but yeah, very common.

1500
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,460
Yeah, to me, that's trash.

1501
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,880
I mean, that's total trash.

1502
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,020
I mean, just write everything that happened in your relationship from day one to the day you divorced,

1503
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,720
and on a piece of paper, so I could crumble it up and throw it away.

1504
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,560
I mean, this is the level that most people are operating on in the Western culture right now.

1505
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:03,320
Now, what I'm saying is a stark contrast to it, but you know what?

1506
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,960
It works, and what I've just said works every time.

1507
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:13,060
It doesn't mean that when you pick someone, the first one and the only one is the only one, right?

1508
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,400
But once you start exercising this principle, it'll end up – well, this is not a guarantee.

1509
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,960
By the way, I never say guarantee.

1510
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,460
I say assurance that this will work for you personally because there's two ways to find out

1511
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,860
whether you should spend the rest of your life living solo.

1512
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:37,040
One is by conscious decision, and the other one is by unconscious exclusion,

1513
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:43,400
which is you want to get into a relationship, and you've been at it now for 50 years.

1514
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,600
You're in your 70s, 80s.

1515
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,000
It hasn't worked out for you yet.

1516
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,740
Well, guess what?

1517
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,440
By unconscious exclusion, you're the type of person that lives alone, right?

1518
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,340
You see, there's two ways.

1519
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,640
So it's rough, but fortunately our lives are short.

1520
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:02,140
You know, 70 or 80 years in cosmic time is not even measurable.

1521
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,320
That's how short it is, right?

1522
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,520
Very short, yeah.

1523
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,400
Yeah, so I don't know.

1524
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,560
What do you think so far?

1525
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:15,380
I think this is really interesting and different from many of the other sonics that we've done,

1526
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,520
and I'm enjoying it, I've got to say.

1527
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,760
So very interesting to contemplate.

1528
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:28,160
Well, not too much because you notice one thing that I—you notice how simple the rules are.

1529
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,700
There's not much to contemplate.

1530
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,120
It's more of a—how would you say it?

1531
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,000
It's a do.

1532
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,540
It's something you have to do.

1533
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,480
It's not something—you could think about doing this for 10 years.

1534
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,340
It ain't going to make it.

1535
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,160
You're not going to get anything out of it.

1536
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:42,920
You have to do it.

1537
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:43,620
Right.

1538
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:49,700
You've got to go out there and mix it up with people, and you see, it's a doer's kind of thing.

1539
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1540
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,120
I get that.

1541
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:59,380
I'm thinking back to my own relationships and how they worked out and made many mistakes.

1542
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,700
It would have been very different, I'm sure, if you had this under your belt.

1543
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,320
If I had this, yeah, exactly.

1544
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,900
I was thinking that, that if I had been thinking this way to begin with,

1545
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,540
I could have saved myself a lot of time and agony, actually.

1546
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,460
Yeah, but where would you save the time?

1547
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:14,500
If you put time in a jar, time is going to pass anyway, so it's okay.

1548
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:24,980
I might have had more time with people that I wanted to be with as opposed to those I found out I didn't want to be with, is all I'm saying.

1549
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,840
Yeah, and the main point here is you actually make the situation.

1550
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,620
It just doesn't happen, right?

1551
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:35,220
The people that are engaged for six years, marry for two, and then divorce, they have no control.

1552
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,360
They think they have control of what's going on,

1553
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,260
but they're just following what has been thrown out by some Illuminati, whatever.

1554
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,000
Let's try this.

1555
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,220
And when I say that, you know, the 60s movement was a farce.

1556
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,240
The 70s movement was a farce, right?

1557
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,260
All that stuff, right?

1558
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,220
It was all fabricated, right?

1559
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,480
All the way down to the way people view how they should be in a relationship is fabricated.

1560
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,700
If you speak to people in the Western world, if they have a television or watch movies or whatever,

1561
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:11,560
99% of their behavior is what they are mimicking or copying what they've seen on television or within their family,

1562
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:20,540
which is also because, look, well, I don't do what is shown on television or the movies.

1563
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,180
All right, how old is your mom and your dad?

1564
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,340
Well, they're so-and-so.

1565
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,700
They were born in the 60s and 70s.

1566
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:26,340
Well, guess what?

1567
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,840
You're doing what they did, and they got it from television, you see.

1568
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,120
So it's one of these things that I'm saying now that's very influential.

1569
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:38,260
Okay, the other thing that I haven't brought up, and it's not minor, but here it's at the end,

1570
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,220
is what if you're already in a relationship and it's working well or it's not working well?

1571
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,360
Well, it goes both ways.

1572
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,360
Which one should we do first?

1573
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,500
You're in a relationship that's not well or a relationship that's well?

1574
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,920
Which one do you want to do first, Chuck?

1575
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,460
Well, I'm sure everybody would want to hear the not well one first.

1576
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:53,800
Okay.

1577
01:22:53,800 --> 01:23:01,280
If it's not going well, when you start getting a proposal together to speak and negotiate with who you're with,

1578
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,760
what it will do, it will be like the sort of the Gordian knot.

1579
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,420
If you could untie this knot, you get our kingdom.

1580
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:15,160
If our relationship is like this knot, we have a problem with it, we've got to just untie this knot or whatever.

1581
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,700
Actually, tying the knot is being married.

1582
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:25,760
If you have a stark proposal and let's come up with some rules or whatever to live by, it will go 50-50.

1583
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,100
It won't stay the same for sure.

1584
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,220
It will 50-50.

1585
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,340
In other words, if you bring this up, let's pick a covenant to live by,

1586
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:39,940
at that point, once that meeting happens, the relationship will never continue the same way.

1587
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,080
It will go 50-50.

1588
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,380
One, it will get better, or you'll break up.

1589
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,160
It will get worse.

1590
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,620
That's the good thing about it.

1591
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:52,180
Because sometimes it not going well and continuing for years and years and years is like the water torture drop on the forehead.

1592
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:52,480
Right?

1593
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:52,980
Right.

1594
01:23:53,500 --> 01:24:00,060
So would you rather have it right there, draw the line as a fork in the road, it ends in disaster or we get better?

1595
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:02,680
I think it's better than the water torture, right?

1596
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:07,960
Oh, I think it's decidedly better to at least have a direction and we know where we're going.

1597
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:08,560
Yeah, definitely.

1598
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:08,920
Exactly.

1599
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,360
That's what happens when it's not going well.

1600
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:26,480
And most of the time, believe it or not, it ends up when the relationship is not so great and you do that, it ends up – I'd say 70% of the time, 80% of the time, it ends up getting better.

1601
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:35,220
Only a small percentage of the time does it completely break up, which would have been inevitable anyway, either way, and also for your health and all these things.

1602
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:35,980
Okay.

1603
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,420
Let's go to the other one now.

1604
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,280
What if your relationship is doing well and it just happens to be doing well?

1605
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,040
What do you think?

1606
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,840
And you bring up a firm covenant.

1607
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,060
90% of the time you're going to break up.

1608
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,300
You heard me.

1609
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,220
If not 95% of the time.

1610
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,200
What?

1611
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:58,600
Greek?

1612
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,660
It doesn't make any sense.

1613
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:13,800
Because earlier you said if your relationship is not going well and you have the meeting and you bring this up, 80% of the time it will go well, about one-third or 20% of the time, let's say, it will break up.

1614
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,040
But now we move over to the relationship is going really well.

1615
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:23,340
Without a rudder, you're just floating on the lake and you bring this up, 90% to 95% of the time you're going to break up.

1616
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:30,960
It doesn't make any sense because it sounded like it was a good thing when it was applied to the relationship that wasn't going well.

1617
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,040
And now we apply the same thing to the relationship that's going well.

1618
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,300
They're going to end up breaking up.

1619
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,980
It doesn't make any sense, does it, Chuck?

1620
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:44,700
Well, actually, it kind of does to me because if you already have a situation, you know, the old, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

1621
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,220
Mm-hmm.

1622
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:45,800
There you go.

1623
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:51,760
You know, that's what it kind of, I mean, I know that sounds real ignorant to a lot of people, but sorry, I agree with it.

1624
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,220
If it's working, then it's working, right?

1625
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:58,120
Yeah, but it's working and you don't know why, you don't know how.

1626
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:02,220
Once you bring in a set of rules to live by or whatever, it breaks up.

1627
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:08,880
And I've told this to people that are in private and whatever for years now, almost a decade and a half.

1628
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:15,020
I would like to say two decades, but I didn't really, I wasn't really a proponent of what I'm discussing until a decade and a half ago.

1629
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,020
Oh, me and my wife were okay or whatever, and I guess we're okay.

1630
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:20,800
You know, the key word is I guess we're okay.

1631
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:25,880
We're, you know, nothing, no big deal, nothing, we don't have any problems, but I want to start living lawfully.

1632
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,160
Oh, really?

1633
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,680
You're going to, she's going to leave you.

1634
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,440
You're going to break up.

1635
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,400
Not only her, her whole family's going to hate you.

1636
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:32,500
Guess what?

1637
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,240
Six months later, Greek, you were right.

1638
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,700
I'm living on my own now.

1639
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:36,600
Right.

1640
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,400
What?

1641
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,800
Every time.

1642
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,940
Not every time, but yeah, most of the time.

1643
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:45,000
Well, because there's already unspoken agreements in place.

1644
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,400
Now, you're coming in to change it, and that person was probably pleased with it.

1645
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,280
The other, you know, the other party, the gal, the guy, whatever, it doesn't matter.

1646
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,000
Chances are you were part of the collective, and you were leaning on television and what everybody else says,

1647
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:03,080
and now you brought something in that's hard and tangible, and it shattered the smoke, you know?

1648
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:07,600
Well, whatever it was, it contradicts what was already in place.

1649
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,220
So, yeah, there you go.

1650
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,500
In most cases, yeah.

1651
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,820
And believe it or not, even in religious quote-unquote situations,

1652
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:19,860
so let's say you were in a religious Jewish family, and you want to be lawful,

1653
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:23,100
and you start figuring out you're supposed to live with the Torah,

1654
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:27,580
and you hear some Greeks speak because you're not going to get anywhere else,

1655
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,460
and how to keep time?

1656
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,140
They're all going to banish you.

1657
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:32,680
You see?

1658
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,820
I don't think people are expecting us to say that, actually.

1659
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,240
If you're just floating along thinking you're doing well,

1660
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,160
once you bring in some structure, it's going to break up.

1661
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,260
I don't think people were expecting that.

1662
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,280
So with that said, I think we're going to wrap this one up.

1663
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,220
There you go.

1664
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,520
I think that's a perfect time to do so.
