1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,480
Rated Y sonic event 9090 Wow, didn't didn't even think we were going to take it this far,

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,460
but it has gone thus far.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,200
Yeah.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,100
Anyway, here we are again.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,760
And I got to begin with some of the stuff that we've been communicated with about in

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,580
recent days, but also think about the past, present, future.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,220
By the way, all of that is simultaneous.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,900
After all, all you actually have is today.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,400
And how are you doing today?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,720
Greek?

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,100
I'm doing all right.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,360
Trying to get my voice back.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,920
My team, my energy is is not being held in the body as well as it could be.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,840
Also, it's interesting.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,480
I had an associate.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,160
He's 10 years younger than me.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,420
Passed away this weekend.

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,220
Oh, yeah.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,680
We had health health issues.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,640
I used to joke around.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,520
We keep eating out.

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,320
It's going to kill you.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,720
I only did.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,360
And I spoke to him two days before and he didn't didn't really have any signs that, you know,

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,600
he was ready to exit.

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,780
So but anyway.

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,140
Well, you know how eating out usually kills you, right?

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,740
It's because you pick the wrong woman.

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,800
But anyway.

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,320
OK, I'm trying to do your salacious joke moment.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,540
You know, I love this.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,740
Listen.

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah.

35
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,820
My my lascivious comment for the show.

36
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,160
OK.

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,580
Anyway.

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,220
And now you have to ask how they like it.

39
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,960
I don't think you're good at it.

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,180
Right.

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,440
Let's see.

42
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,720
Let me just bring that up real quick.

43
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,360
Yeah, please.

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,500
What's this with women?

45
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,700
Think that all women think they're good at sex.

46
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,300
Right.

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,240
This is crazy.

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,140
I've noticed this.

49
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,300
But not all of them.

50
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,760
Some of them.

51
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,460
Most of them.

52
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,360
I say that I've known think they're good at sex.

53
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,140
That's ridiculous.

54
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,620
No one is you.

55
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
It's about communication.

56
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,520
Right.

57
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,420
So anyway.

58
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:45,900
Absolutely.

59
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,500
Speaking of that.

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,600
I think the great philosopher Eddie Murphy actually codified this entire concept perfectly

61
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,580
when he said that, you know, sometimes if you haven't been eating for a long, long time

62
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,500
and somebody gives you a saltine, you are grateful.

63
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,060
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,980
That's the greatest saltine I ever did have.

65
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
And all that.

66
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,500
And he related this to the idea that sex is great with somebody when you first meet him.

67
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,640
And then every once in a while you roll over after a little bit of time and go, man, I

68
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,060
just had some regular old crackers.

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
But anyway.

70
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,040
Yeah, that's kind of.

71
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,340
Yeah.

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,100
It's still relevant.

73
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,320
I get it.

74
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,860
Yeah, I get it.

75
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,220
And why is it relevant to this?

76
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,320
Well, you know, the one thing that's been effing us all one way or another, the way

77
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,860
I see it and and definitely fucking up the planet as we go, came up in chat right recently.

78
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,660
The construction of the church, the fact that it's a female in a sexual position and the

79
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,060
portal, the opening, which you can go in and out of is the back view.

80
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,380
You've got two openings.

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,660
Yeah.

82
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,120
The back.

83
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,340
Yeah.

84
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,520
Is the rear view.

85
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,740
Yeah.

86
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,500
The front door and the back door on the same side.

87
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Well, I always thought of it as there's always a window above the door in most churches directly.

88
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,300
So you got the two that are close to the back door.

89
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,160
But it's a window.

90
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:04,900
Yep.

91
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,760
Well, depending on your perspective, they're either right next to each other or they're

92
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,160
on opposite sides of one another.

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,140
By the way, your voice sounds fairly young at this point.

94
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I don't hear it with the yin energy, which would be no, no.

95
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,980
It's tough.

96
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,000
Ever since I had the circus flu, I call it the circus because Wendy Blades, the niece,

97
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
she's a sword swallower.

98
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,880
You can look her up.

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,180
Right.

100
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,160
And we look actually, Linda, the wife, said that we have a race was my sister's daughter.

101
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,540
Right.

102
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,200
OK.

103
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,460
But the circus, by the way, it's tied all together because church means Cirque, which

104
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,100
is Cirque like Cirque de Soleil.

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes.

106
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,640
When I was speaking with her, there is a very high venerance and reverence to the circus,

107
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,200
by the way.

108
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,160
In other words, it's very much like speaking to someone that's in a clergy, not different.

109
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,860
In other words, the sentiment is the same and it should be because it is.

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,780
Well, they hold a specific place in society.

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,960
They are observed by a lot of people on very special occasions.

112
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,800
There's high emotion connected to it.

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,740
Usually there are pseudo supernatural supernatural suggestions connected to it, because what

114
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,459
do you often see?

115
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,580
Magic tricks, death defying stuff.

116
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,840
So they don't even have to do they've gotten so lazy.

117
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,820
They don't do that anymore.

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,140
Well, I'm thinking of the circus that I did see when I was a kid a long, long time ago.

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,580
Yeah.

120
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,540
They don't do that stuff anymore because all you need is one.

121
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,800
I think back.

122
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:36,880
OK.

123
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,500
When you were a kid, right, let's say back in the 60s, 70s and 80s, it was common to

124
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,480
hear of fatalities at the circus, you know, based on the performers.

125
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,780
You have one fatality now and they'll shut it down.

126
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,660
They'll shut down the entire venue.

127
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,800
I mean, not just your venue, but all the circuses now are bad.

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

129
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,440
You see how I'm going with this.

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,200
OK.

131
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,240
So, yeah, supposedly there's a video of the of the circus.

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,100
This one is Paranormal Circus, it's called.

133
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
There was an accident and I looked at the video of it.

134
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
That's not an accident.

135
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,180
The guy just kind of like flipped his toe on the tightrope and grabbed it and got back

136
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,400
on.

137
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,260
That's not an accident.

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,820
When I say here accident, it was like, wasn't the Willenda brothers or whatever one of them?

139
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Actually, they were doing these acrobatics without without a safety net.

140
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,140
Right.

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,640
Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,820
Hit the deck and bite it.

143
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,300
Right.

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,460
One of the flying Willenda's did die.

145
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,000
I think.

146
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,780
Was it the 60s or 70s?

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,940
It could have been even later.

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,820
Was it later?

149
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,360
Wow.

150
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,680
OK.

151
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's look at it.

152
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,780
I'm in front of the laptop right now.

153
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,340
Well, you go ahead and look it up.

154
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,440
But I remember that.

155
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,700
And also there is yet again the high tension of the animal training.

156
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,060
Right.

157
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,140
Which is, in my mind, a bit cruel.

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,420
But, you know, with the tiger, what do they call them?

159
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,080
Lion tamers.

160
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,460
Right.

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,720
Mm hmm.

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,720
There's always this let's play around with the idea that somebody could die during this

163
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,100
event.

164
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,400
Or at least that's the way it used to be, whether it was.

165
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,820
Yeah.

166
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,440
You're right.

167
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,260
Sixty two Detroit performance.

168
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,100
Sixty two.

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,380
OK.

170
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,480
I thought it was the 60s.

171
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
And yeah.

172
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,840
And that stuck with people for years and years.

173
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,900
That one death, by the way, that was like the don't forget the flying Willenda died.

174
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,960
And you know, what's odd about that to me is that, you know, in the 70s, again, there

175
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,700
were people trying to walk tightropes in between skyscrapers a little more often than you see

176
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,080
in today.

177
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,420
Yeah.

178
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,760
Petit Philippe, whatever his name was, Philippe Petit or something.

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,040
Yeah.

180
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,840
Shot an arrow.

181
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah.

182
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,560
That was.

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah.

184
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,160
He tried to do it on his own.

185
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,020
Shot an arrow.

186
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,880
But they pulled a rope and pulled the cable.

187
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,600
They stop it.

188
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,460
They said, hey, wait a second.

189
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,800
Let's just do a sanctioned event.

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,080
Right.

191
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah.

192
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:41,780
Right.

193
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,120
Right.

194
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,100
So, yeah.

195
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,180
He didn't know that there were nukes underground.

196
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,420
But well, yeah.

197
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,060
And a lot more death defying than even the the antics of what one of the most popular

198
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,080
iconic guys to get on a Harley in that time period.

199
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,320
Evil can evil.

200
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,020
Right.

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,360
Yeah.

202
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:58,780
Yeah.

203
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah.

204
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
That was a big deal.

205
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,720
I remember I was sweating.

206
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
The evil can evil bicycle.

207
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,280
They I think it was Huffy made an evil can evil bicycle and so it had the stick shift

208
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,100
like the Ross.

209
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,080
All right.

210
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,700
The one with the banana seat sticks.

211
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,020
Yeah.

212
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,800
It was really dangerous.

213
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,660
I remember once borrowing a bike and falling off in the six ships got me right where I,

214
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,580
you know.

215
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:18,980
Oh, yeah.

216
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,180
Right.

217
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,200
The family jewels.

218
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,460
You know, the prestigious thing that might not be so glamorous to ride if you actually

219
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,060
try to ride it anyway.

220
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,780
Why are we talking about the circus here?

221
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,040
Greek?

222
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,640
Well, it does.

223
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,500
Well, because it's like the church.

224
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,500
The church.

225
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:33,600
Sure.

226
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,340
It's the same.

227
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300
It's the same thing.

228
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,520
It's a derivation.

229
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Yeah.

230
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,380
What came first.

231
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,680
Right.

232
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,160
The chicken or the egg.

233
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,180
The circus or the church.

234
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,680
The circus.

235
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,660
Well, I would think the temple to Searcy is what came first.

236
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,380
Right.

237
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,880
Sure.

238
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,480
Sure.

239
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:47,800
Yeah.

240
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,300
But the entire thing about the bread and circuses is still around.

241
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,880
And by the way, speaking of bread and circus, I've been trying to engage people in conversation

242
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,140
and just to get feedback.

243
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
And I'll do this with the listeners here.

244
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,200
What do you think?

245
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,640
OK, this is a total segue, but we'll go back to these subjects in plural.

246
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,940
Total segue.

247
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,880
But there is no scarcity in the world for anything.

248
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,820
Everything is there's more stuff than there are people to use that stuff.

249
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,140
And I'm not saying being wasteful.

250
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,740
So there's no scarcity.

251
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,940
What there is, though, is they've convinced everyone that they need to use what they call

252
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,980
their fiat currency.

253
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,760
More specifically, fiat currency to get that stuff.

254
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,980
So how about bypassing the fiat currency and developing a more cogent, a more a system

255
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,720
that's more palatable of trade and barter, not necessarily barter, because there's trade

256
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,080
on alternative trade, right, where you don't have to have.

257
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,020
Right.

258
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,860
Because, OK, when you're using they've got everyone using the digital money and all that

259
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,160
stuff.

260
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,740
Right.

261
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,000
Right.

262
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,680
OK.

263
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,080
So when it comes time to like the subs here, how would they sub, right?

264
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,440
If you're not using digital currency, right?

265
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,600
How will it be?

266
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
Another way.

267
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,900
Right.

268
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,980
So just to show you how prolific that we're working with.

269
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,640
This is the thing that everyone is really stuck in and they don't notice it.

270
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,260
I'm not over grandizing or adding more importance than needed or overemphasizing the quote unquote

271
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,120
money system.

272
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,220
But you're at a point right now socially that you are stuck in a system that could kill

273
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,020
you literally.

274
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,600
I mean, it will if there was no electronic money transfers or cash, how would people

275
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,240
get along?

276
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,260
And I mean that literally, how would they get what they need?

277
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,880
The state of confusion, right, would be so high.

278
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:49,560
And this was since 1929, because in 1929, if you looked at even old black and white

279
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,500
movies when they show a corporate office, like where the CEO or the boss was always

280
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,860
in the scene, somewhere in the office other than the big desk and the chair off to the

281
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,860
side was a tall, almost human size height safe in every corporate office.

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,420
But why?

283
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,500
Because at the end of the week, the workers would get a slip, they'd sign it and they'd

284
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,400
get their their pay, right, salary or wages in cash.

285
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,660
They didn't go to the banks with checks.

286
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,840
As a matter of fact, back in those days, if you gave someone a check, they thought you

287
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
were pulling a stunt on them.

288
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,480
Financial fraud of some kind, which it is financial fraud.

289
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,620
But so what they did was they stopped the cash on every week or every month or whenever

290
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,160
it periodically the someone in the office would go to the bank and get the payroll from

291
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,600
the bank.

292
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,920
Right.

293
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,980
Well, what what happened during the depression is the bank said, sorry, we have no cash.

294
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,740
Kind of like, you know, they did the fake coin shortage past couple of years.

295
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,080
Right.

296
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,340
By the way, with the fake coin shortage, if there was a coin shortage, you'd bring your

297
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,860
coins to the bank and they would give you five, 10 percent over what you gave them.

298
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,080
Right.

299
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,560
So there was no coin shortage.

300
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,060
Yeah.

301
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,240
Because I called the bank.

302
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,040
I said, coin shortage.

303
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,060
Yeah, we have coin shortage.

304
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,600
So if I bring you a dollar's worth of coins, how much are you give me back a dollar?

305
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,220
Well, there's no shortage because that's the bad.

306
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,040
Think about it.

307
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,040
That's terrible economics.

308
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,440
Right.

309
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,560
Because when there's a shortage, the price goes up.

310
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:10,740
Right.

311
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,180
So anyway.

312
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah.

313
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,260
What they did was no cash available.

314
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,940
So the workers didn't get for the first week or two.

315
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,340
Let's say you worked where you made electric motors.

316
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,700
Right.

317
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,460
So they gave you a few motors to take with you and barter.

318
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,260
So the guy, one of the guys, you know, of 100 guys that work in the electric motor factory

319
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,560
goes down to the grocery store and get some milk, flour, bread, whatever, and puts it at

320
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,720
the counter, ready to check out, let's say, and gives him an electric motor.

321
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
And he says, no, I don't want an electric motor for this.

322
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,840
The store or the grocery store owner says, why?

323
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,420
He says, I've got 15 of them here.

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,100
What am I going to do with any more electric motors?

325
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,740
Get out of here.

326
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,260
You see?

327
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,660
So there's a problem here that we are experiencing now, not because I'm not talking about factory,

328
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,700
but just generally, how would you get along if all if the Internet went down?

329
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,100
Right.

330
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,060
The Internet went down a and then B, there was no cash either.

331
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,560
How would you get along?

332
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,220
And the answer to that right now is you won't.

333
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,040
There is no system in place.

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,520
There's no backup system like, you know, again, let's segue again.

335
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,540
OK, the Internet works on actually knew one of the people that knew one of the people

336
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,780
that started the Sun Microsystems that did installations for all the routers that literally

337
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,880
were cables put underground, like under manholes.

338
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,420
Right. Back in the 80s to get all this ready.

339
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,940
And it was called the Janet system.

340
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,960
It was the joint academic joint academic network.

341
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,360
Janet, do you remember that?

342
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
No. Yeah. Well, that was piggybacked on the on the Internet.

343
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,380
Right. Yeah. Right.

344
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,360
So with with that system in place, where was I going with this?

345
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,080
The Internet being put in place, relying on such a system and then relying on dial up.

346
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,320
Right. But now there's no more analog dial up.

347
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,220
It's all digital. Right. So let's say the entire digital system goes down.

348
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,560
Can we make an Internet based on ham radio?

349
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,200
With a series of cells, you know, ham radio people carrying.

350
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,120
So how would you do extra long frequencies, which is ham radio, that extra extra long

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,820
like military, but they're long frequencies.

352
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,660
How would you carry your data on ham radio, which is very autonomous, very independent,

353
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,060
isn't it? Well, I talked about this on my show, believe it or not.

354
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,500
And, you know, covering the financial thing.

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,220
First of all, the coin shortage is just stupid because the fact is that long before anybody

356
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,580
even mentioned the words coin shortage, they weren't making as many coins as people

357
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,000
thought. Anyway, the stuff didn't exist anyway.

358
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,760
It doesn't matter if it exists because we've got a little different.

359
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,660
Coins don't represent a lean coin.

360
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,540
You know, coins don't are not notes.

361
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,480
Right. But the way they do that is by putting material that is worth less than the coin.

362
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,500
They have a problem when the material in the coins in your pocket has more value than the

363
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,920
coin states.

364
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,460
Right. If nickel went to, you know, five thousand dollars an ounce, you'd have a big

365
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,700
problem, you know, because there's very little nickel in it.

366
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,740
It's it's basically well, whatever zinc and copper.

367
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,060
It's inverted. Right.

368
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,520
But it's the same amount of material.

369
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,160
The penny and the nickel are the same thing.

370
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
It's just they're inverted. Right.

371
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,660
Right. It's kind of a penny silver.

372
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,880
Right. Yeah. But mostly pennies aren't copper either.

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Anyway, they're either zinc or a composite.

374
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,660
But it's all it's mostly zinc with a coat.

375
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,220
It's the coating. So, you know, like that.

376
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,180
What is that gold coin? It's supposed to be a dollar.

377
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,980
Where is it that after that black lady?

378
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,900
What's it? Well, they made a bunch of them.

379
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,880
They made a Sacagawea that was gold colored.

380
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,100
They made the presidential coins that were gold colored.

381
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,340
And there's no coin.

382
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,820
It's OK. So you brought up.

383
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
OK, let's go back to the coinage.

384
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,620
Do you think coinage is the answer?

385
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,220
And then how do you get a coin over through the mail, I guess?

386
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,240
I don't know. Well, these things need to be considered.

387
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,580
Yeah, that's problematic, because I'll tell you something that happened to me

388
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,320
just this week is I was supposed to get a bunch of half dollars in the mail.

389
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,380
And, you know, I ended up with an empty package when it got to my doorstep.

390
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,760
No way. Yeah. Somebody stole

391
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,760
19 JFK half dollars that were sent to me.

392
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,180
Anyway, it's packaged very well, then.

393
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,620
Well, it was packaged pretty well, but you could feel it.

394
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,380
And, you know, it wasn't the best.

395
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Yes, you should never.

396
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,540
Yeah, you should never be able to detect by feel alone.

397
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,800
I have someone that worked at the post office.

398
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
What they do if they think something is valuable.

399
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,500
They have a very fast conveyor, by the way, very fast.

400
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,140
But it changes enough hands that they radio down the conveyor belt.

401
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,080
And what they do is they turn around because they have camera surveillance

402
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,720
and they bump it with their elbow as it falls off the conveyor.

403
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,080
And another guy kicks it with his foot to the other side of the building.

404
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
And then later on their break, they pick it up.

405
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,440
You see how it's done.

406
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,100
Yeah, something looks like an accident.

407
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,800
So there's no obvious look like it's hard to track

408
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
where the hell actually happened to it.

409
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,500
Exactly. Yes.

410
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,700
Because even though they photograph, by the way, they photograph

411
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,620
almost every piece of mail as it moves.

412
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,640
I don't know if people know this,

413
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,100
but literally there is a recorded photograph of different stops

414
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,620
that your mail makes usually. OK.

415
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,160
Even if it's not meant to be tracked, doesn't have it.

416
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
Everything has a tracking number, but you don't have access to it

417
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,020
unless you pay extra. Sure.

418
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,820
The point is that everything is actually tracked.

419
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,400
So these guys who want to steal mail directly have had to become innovative

420
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,520
because too many of them got busted.

421
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,500
That's right. It has to look like an accident.

422
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,680
And then the person monitoring it is not going to go ahead.

423
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,300
And unless there's an independent audit, which probably won't happen.

424
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,100
But this has been happening for a long time using this methodology. Right.

425
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,600
And you never want to make things look like they do

426
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
when you're sending them anywhere anyway.

427
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,620
Like, for instance, if you take and you make, you know,

428
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,820
you wanted to send some cash notes in the mail,

429
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,980
what you would do is make sure that it's definitely not shaped like a like a dollar

430
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,760
or, you know, in that general shape.

431
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,500
And also don't allow it to look like a greeting card,

432
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,880
because a lot of mailmen will turn around and guess what?

433
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,119
Sure. Accidentally, you know, rip your card open

434
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,119
to see if there's something in there that they can cash easily or if there's cash.

435
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,859
I wouldn't blame it directly at the at the general group of mailmen and all that.

436
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,220
I think it's just a very small group in there.

437
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,619
And it's also intelligence agencies seeing what they could get away with, of course.

438
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,000
Right. Well, there's also that.

439
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,620
But it's a common thing that is occurring a lot more.

440
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,460
And yeah, sure. Which is the pitfall.

441
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,460
If you want to grade the quality of a nation, it's ability to, you know,

442
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,220
work is great.

443
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,920
Their postal system.

444
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,800
I knew someone. Well, back in the world, we're doing some business.

445
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,920
We had a post box in Mexico. Right.

446
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,980
And I went down there.

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
There were literally cobwebs and the place was dirty.

448
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,940
There was litter inside the post office.

449
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,180
Keys didn't work for post office boxes.

450
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
It was. Yeah, it was.

451
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
There's no uniforms. They don't wear uniforms.

452
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,440
It was really like a ragtag whatever.

453
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,820
So Mexico, if you want to make yourself look better,

454
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,640
get a better postal service anyway.

455
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,080
Yeah. Well, I've described to people before because I went to Italy

456
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
when I was very young and I mailed a letter

457
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,080
that didn't get here until two months after I came home.

458
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,980
There you go. Because it was stuck in the Italian mail system.

459
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,220
Why? Because the country was so corrupt

460
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,860
that their their their mail system was nearly paralyzed.

461
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,960
And I'm told that it's, you know, a little better today.

462
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,880
But I don't think it's a lot better.

463
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,920
It's EU regulations.

464
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,360
So overstep their national stuff might have been an upgrade, actually, for them.

465
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
But yeah, exactly. Yeah.

466
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,380
But anyway, back to so many things, sex, church.

467
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,920
Well, back to the currency for trade.

468
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,740
Yeah. So back to the coins, which I kicked off this mail discussion

469
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,140
by telling you I lost some coins.

470
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,920
Here's the reality with the coins, though, is that they present

471
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,680
a different kind of instability issue for value being exchanged.

472
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,000
Clearly, they're not just worthless paper. Right.

473
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
But at the same time, they're not paper at all.

474
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,540
And there's they don't state that they are lean either. Right.

475
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,600
The banknotes state that they're lean because they're not redeemable.

476
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,340
But they're still subject to manipulation based on the fact

477
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,340
that if they manipulate the value of the components that go together

478
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,400
to make there is no value, it's deliberate.

479
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,280
There is no value in the components.

480
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,940
Well, yeah, but since it was silver.

481
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
But there's some value to copper.

482
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,780
I mean, it's not great.

483
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,640
There's so little copper there.

484
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,580
Cut a penny in half.

485
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,860
Well, right. But they used to be they used to be made out of copper.

486
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,700
See what we're talking about now, though, you used to.

487
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,760
Coin was usually precious metal. That's right.

488
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,140
Yeah. Right. So, you know, what I what I want to just bring forward

489
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,500
is the thinking process on how if the system went away,

490
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,480
which it won't, by the way, will not collapse.

491
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,980
You'll have faults, you know, where everything's like the lockdowns,

492
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,860
you know, where things stop.

493
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,340
But it won't collapse.

494
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,940
Not until not until other things collapse.

495
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,920
Well, very much like plate tectonics and earthquakes.

496
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,460
Occasionally things will shake up.

497
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,400
Sometimes stuff will get destroyed or fall down,

498
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,940
but it doesn't completely destroy the place entirely.

499
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,160
Yeah. Yeah. But in the meantime, while the stuff is available, how about OK?

500
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,980
You know, I didn't even have to go through all that,

501
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,980
but I didn't see I didn't want to bring up cryptocurrency.

502
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,500
But cryptocurrency is doing that because, you know, we take Bitcoin, right?

503
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,140
That's all you got to say. Right.

504
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,700
I mean, it's places and right.

505
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,940
They even have Bitcoin ATMs and whatever.

506
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,820
So that's not what I'm talking about, because Bitcoin is still part of.

507
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,840
Obviously, it's an intelligence operation, right?

508
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,800
I mean, it's pretty obvious anything that is publicly known

509
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,060
that makes thousands of percent, quote unquote, profit is intelligence.

510
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,720
And if it's not, it won't last very long.

511
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,440
They take it over.

512
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,900
Right. And clearly, this is a beta test right now going on to see exactly

513
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,760
what happens when they come out with the so-called legitimate, you know,

514
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,360
CBDC, the replacement digital currency.

515
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,060
Sure. The government's not time.

516
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,780
It's just not time for it yet.

517
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,880
But eventually the governments will say, you know what?

518
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,220
Let's switch all the digital stuff and so on.

519
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,220
And of course, a lot of people are talking about that.

520
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,660
But it already is, Chuck.

521
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,840
It is all digital.

522
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,800
Well, OK, there's so there's what?

523
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,340
Three. There's less than you stole my punchline, but that's OK.

524
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,520
Go ahead. That's OK. Go ahead.

525
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,480
I'll stop. I'll yield.

526
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,340
No, no, no.

527
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,840
Listen, I have no problem with you stealing my punchline

528
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,760
because I've been screaming about this for a long time that, you know, people go,

529
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,200
look, Bitcoin is the future.

530
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,800
It's obvious.

531
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,760
And, you know, and blockchain technology.

532
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,320
And I go, yeah, but here's the problem.

533
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,980
I guarantee you that it's being rolled out to replace the stuff you have now

534
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,360
because you know what? It'll be less of a hassle.

535
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,080
You don't have to have a minting facility, right?

536
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,420
You can just do it with a computer and a story.

537
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,780
Couple of built on scarcity.

538
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,120
They only did so many. Right.

539
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,440
Oh, yeah. But once you see where it's a natural system,

540
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,940
there is no scarcity to money.

541
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,180
They can always mine more, make more the scarcity.

542
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,580
OK, well, just like you said, just go further.

543
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,420
You said with all with all resources, right, that the scarcity is artificial.

544
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,900
It is part of the manipulation. Sure.

545
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,120
It doesn't mean that here's the problem with the money, the way they do

546
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,880
the fiat currency, it's you cannot have infinite credit creation in a finite world.

547
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,900
Right. The world is finite, but it is abundant.

548
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,460
There's a difference between no scarcity because of abundance

549
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,840
and then finite versus infinite.

550
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,440
See, their credit system is based on infinite credit creation,

551
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,920
but it's a finite world.

552
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,320
And this is a parallel discussion to abundance and no scarcity.

553
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,280
When I say there's no scarcity, I mean there is abundance, not infinite.

554
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,480
Right. Because there's always going to be a finite number of people.

555
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,360
There's never the right.

556
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,600
You can't say there's an infinite number of people. It's finite.

557
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,340
So in other words, no matter how big that finite is,

558
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,820
the abundance will prevail to a degree.

559
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,060
But we have a system that mathematically works on infinite credit creation.

560
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,760
So now we have a bigger problem, which we'll discuss on a future thing.

561
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,100
The thing I want to put up is how do you structure?

562
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,660
Because it's not the barter and trade.

563
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,540
People could do that.

564
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,320
And, you know, that's very simple notion.

565
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,640
But how do you do it in an organized way?

566
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,140
We we don't have chaos. Right.

567
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,960
Well, you're aware of some of the efforts to do this, I'm sure.

568
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,840
Like the you know, the centralized notes that they came up

569
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,940
regarding your labor being transferred to your in Buffalo.

570
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,700
And also in Africa, they have the the Ubuntu project,

571
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,960
which I'm sure you've heard of, which is, you know,

572
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,160
the literal exchange of your labor skill.

573
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,440
So like, let's just say it's like the operating system.

574
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,720
I think it's spelled the same, isn't it?

575
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,400
Well, I want to scale a rater. Right.

576
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,680
So I come to you and I say, look, Greek, I grow rice.

577
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,960
So I'll tell you what I'll do.

578
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,700
How many bags of, you know, that fine rice that you like.

579
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,860
If you like the quality of rice, I grow.

580
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,820
How many pounds of fine rice would you accept in exchange for your scale?

581
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,560
Sure. And then I stock the rice and then I have to fight.

582
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,540
But then you'll have spending all the time, all your time

583
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,060
trying to figure out who is going to use your various inventories for trade.

584
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,620
You see. So that's where the inefficiency part comes in.

585
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,140
No, it could be. I get that.

586
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,140
That doesn't work, by the way.

587
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,140
I've considered that, you know, because if I OK, you want

588
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,160
and then someone else gives me something else, gasoline and have tanks of gasoline.

589
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,540
I have to. So instead of working on the scalerator,

590
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,800
I have to find someone to buy the rice and the gasoline or trade that.

591
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,600
So then you lose.

592
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,580
Then we go into another situation.

593
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,520
So how do we do it without being losing time efficiency?

594
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,700
OK, you you get you get you see where this is going.

595
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,720
So the main thing is, how do you set this up in a gradual, systematic way?

596
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,620
And also, how do you replace the Internet with ham radio?

597
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,860
Because I don't see any other.

598
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,060
But would you say infrastructure that could that could be as independent

599
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,800
as ham radio if you other than carrier pigeon or.

600
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,580
Well, I've talked about that on my show a bit, too.

601
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,680
And I mean, one of the interesting ideas was to create a modular situation

602
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,340
where you take something like the independent small.

603
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,740
And there's an independent small and radio wave band band wave

604
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,080
that's out there that you don't require an FCC license for or whatever.

605
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,220
Sure. If I set one up in my backyard and somebody within, say,

606
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,480
10 miles of me sets up another one in their backyard,

607
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,100
we now have an interconnected broadcast system.

608
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,040
Well, here's the thing with the FCC.

609
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,680
If you read it very carefully, it's commercially based.

610
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,260
Yes. What it does is it enforces that you might potentially infringe

611
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,280
on someone's ability to do commerce who has a license. Right.

612
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,200
Right. It's about interference.

613
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,160
But you don't need it.

614
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,860
You don't have to get a FCC license if you are not interfering

615
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,800
and also rebut the production of the presumption of possibly interfering.

616
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,500
There's a way to do that, by the way.

617
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,320
Oh, yeah. But these independent small, you know, transmitters

618
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,180
I'm talking about are automatically already there as something that has.

619
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,700
Oh, I get it.

620
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Regulatory.

621
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,000
This is still something that has to be brought up in a see, even you and I

622
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,220
discussing it, discussing this is not our, you know, the parlance in our.

623
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,700
We can't really parlay because it's not our field, let's say specifically.

624
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,020
But there is no simple way.

625
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,620
Right. It's not like, hey, get a computer.

626
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,100
When you get a computer, download Skype and we'll talk.

627
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,720
You see how easy that is?

628
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, it's only even if you don't even if you don't have a computer,

629
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,740
you got it already laid out. Right.

630
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,340
Well, but this isn't bad if you let me just carry on with the concept.

631
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,760
Right. If you go for the 10 mile idea or the five mile idea,

632
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,660
it simply means all you have to do is create a contact

633
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,840
with somebody who's five miles or less away.

634
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,800
Yeah, sure. Like the cell phone transmitter.

635
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,760
And if we all agree to be on a singular,

636
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,960
you know, one of these open frequencies, then we can create a network

637
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,060
as large as the entire North American continent without a problem.

638
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,940
Yeah. But only, you know, a thousand watts at a time.

639
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,860
No, that's fine.

640
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,500
Actually, you might want to use earth transmission.

641
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,240
So you're not using it.

642
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,480
You know, you're using two layer occurrence, the current electricity

643
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,700
that exists in the earth.

644
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,200
That's not hard to do.

645
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,860
If you look at the Tesla patents, ask people who have done it.

646
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,900
All you got to do is follow the patent.

647
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,400
So when he shows a certain kind of copper wrapped around a block of wood,

648
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,180
don't go to Home Depot and get a piece of plastic with copper wire.

649
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,800
You got to, you know, build it just like it is in the patent.

650
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,860
And guess what? It'll work. Right.

651
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,300
So this is not. Yeah, we don't need the power aspect of it.

652
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Yeah, I wouldn't.

653
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,540
By the way, even now, if you ask me to set up a radio system quickly,

654
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,780
I wouldn't use it.

655
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,120
I would use the earth energy.

656
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,280
But theoretically, the reason why I present the AM version of it

657
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,840
is because it gives the consumer

658
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,260
very easy access, because all they have to do is find something

659
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,300
that accepts AM radio transmission.

660
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,300
And you have now.

661
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,680
It's getting harder every day.

662
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,620
Well, yeah, I want I wanted to go get a portable radio

663
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,620
just for a portable radio sake, and I can't find them in stores.

664
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,160
They're still pretty common, to be honest with you.

665
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,840
A lot of places.

666
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,300
I mean, I can go to a store called Roses, which is right down the street.

667
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,380
I don't know if you have those in Arizona, but

668
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,700
Roses, Walmarts, places like that often have some electronics

669
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,100
somewhere in there that is a freestanding radio receiver.

670
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,560
Alarm clock radio, I saw was the best at Walmart.

671
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,560
Well, see, now there's alarm clock radios.

672
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,460
And also when you go to like your family dollars and things like that,

673
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,580
usually in the electronics area, they have a couple of radios.

674
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,240
That place, Roses, has about I was at a family dollar.

675
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,840
Also, they had an FM converter,

676
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,980
but not a radio where you could put batteries in it and you're off you go.

677
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,680
And it was an FM broadcaster converter.

678
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,340
You know, it's attached to the end of a.

679
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,080
Cassette tape that you put in a car.

680
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,220
Yeah, so maybe I don't know.

681
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,620
Yeah, no, it's just Tucson where I'm at.

682
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,900
It is kind of accessible.

683
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,500
Like there are literally 25 different devices for AM reception.

684
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,960
I did this as a survey at Roses, about five at the Walmart,

685
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,700
about five or six at Family Dollar, about five or six at Dollar General.

686
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,560
I'm just saying it in general in the cheap.

687
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
They're still sort of available.

688
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,880
Their store is still sort of available, plus secondary market.

689
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,180
You go to a flea market, I guarantee you can find a radio.

690
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,620
Now, I know what your problem is,

691
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,520
because I went looking for a boom box and had trouble there.

692
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,560
You know, what I wanted is something that had a cassette, a CD and a radio.

693
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,880
So guess what? I just want like a group.

694
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,540
I mean, you know, what would be what I would want is a Grundig World Radio.

695
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,300
Oh, no, I love it.

696
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,860
Yeah. Grundig makes a world radio and it does.

697
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,840
Yeah, no, I loved my radio with the with the minimum of seven bands

698
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,920
where you have, I think it's five, five shortwave, one longwave, AM and FM,

699
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,040
although they call it microwave on the on the world radios.

700
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,920
But no, but see, there you go again.

701
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,940
And by the way, you can get a Grundig.

702
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,200
You just go to Jeff Bozo's Amazon.

703
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,560
I'm sure they're up there.

704
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,140
That's another thing is if you search on Amazon, I promise you,

705
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,400
you can find radio receivers of some type and they might be real simple

706
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,520
or little throwbacks to the transistor.

707
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,660
But I'm just saying is that the technology is cheap still.

708
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,400
For somebody who wants to receive it, if we, you know, created this network

709
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,240
and theoretically created a nice large web that that covered a lot of territory,

710
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,140
then you don't want to lead it with the intention that you want it as a backup.

711
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,900
But what I'm saying is if people just start talking about it,

712
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,440
it will come. It will.

713
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,940
It will somehow find a ground where everyone will do it.

714
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,360
OK, you don't you want.

715
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,220
How do I say this? I've said it before.

716
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,160
Any movement that's going to be successful has to be a leader of this movement.

717
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,740
Right. Oh, yeah. No one. No group. No. Right.

718
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,480
It's just putting it the consciousness out there.

719
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,640
Just just like the the church is like that.

720
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
You know, people don't know.

721
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,660
This is well, that's why I go back.

722
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,060
Well, that's why I like the concept, though, of this interconnected radio thing,

723
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,460
because it's not dependent on any one leader.

724
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,920
It's not dependent on any one area except you're responsible for your immediate area.

725
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,460
Yeah. But how do you.

726
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,900
But how do you. OK, just like the money system.

727
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,800
Yeah. Everyone is familiar with barter trade, whatever.

728
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,460
But how do you do it without instilling chaos and also losing time

729
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,140
on your own to barter more to for the things you just bartered? Right.

730
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,520
And I've gone over what money is and how it works before.

731
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,440
And there's no reason to recap.

732
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,960
But let's just tie it back to the church.

733
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,800
You know, any church as known, the standard comes from the Vatican. Right. Right.

734
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
That's the standard.

735
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,460
They standardized it.

736
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,160
And any form of religion is also Vatican approved.

737
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,540
It doesn't matter what it is.

738
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,740
That's especially in the Christian ethos.

739
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,400
So it is OK.

740
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,780
It is centrally based, just like the central banks. Right.

741
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,240
Approve whatever.

742
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,340
But from Buddha to Mohammed, it's all approved by the Catholic Church in reality.

743
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,880
But go ahead.

744
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,540
But it's not the central part that's bad, because if you look back at ancient times,

745
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,240
they did have centralized economies when it came to monies and measurements.

746
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,540
You know, you'll if you no matter what, if you look at the ancient

747
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,640
megalithic sites, they use the same unit of measurement. Right.

748
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,700
In other words, divided by the same unit of measurement. Right.

749
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,820
Yeah. The inch.

750
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,360
So they did have they did use.

751
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,380
They have standard things.

752
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,960
That's that's basically a centralized agreement.

753
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,860
But the current centralized systems we have, no matter what they are,

754
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,220
are not beneficial. Right. Not beneficial at all.

755
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,500
Well, that's why a lot of people like the concept of a gold coin,

756
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,680
regardless of what you stamp on it or whatever.

757
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,280
You can quantify it because there's an acceptable rate

758
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,860
for what the weight of this is.

759
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,020
So so much of an hour. Right.

760
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,080
Not the numismatics.

761
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,800
Then there's the numismatic side.

762
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,120
But that's not what I would consider.

763
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,420
That's another thing.

764
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,120
But those are, you know, slightly less pure.

765
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm talking about stuff that was made either 90 percent or higher

766
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,300
of the element, you know, because you have to.

767
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,020
Yeah. 90 percent is practical.

768
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,700
The reason why there's no pure silver or pure gold is because it's too malleable.

769
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,880
Right. Right.

770
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,860
So you always figure it out.

771
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,460
A 90 percent rate value, you know, whatever weight is.

772
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,140
It's the value of it isn't 90.

773
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,200
And that's why only collector coins come in the 99 percent,

774
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,740
you know, because of that, which, by the way, you know,

775
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,040
they're still making collector coins anyway, you know,

776
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,940
which shows me that silver is not really in a shortage.

777
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,360
If they have to do, you know, reprints of the old dollar style

778
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,800
just to release them for collectors.

779
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,880
And even though they say USA one dollar on them,

780
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,980
they're not even accepted as monetized currency.

781
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,080
No, because, you know, because you're in your receivership.

782
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,300
It is. It's really screwy.

783
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,820
It's really, you know, OK.

784
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,400
And the people that work with this stuff don't know anything about my you know,

785
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,920
I've said lawyers don't know any law.

786
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,000
Doctors don't know anything about the human body.

787
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,560
What is what do you mean?

788
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,100
I went to a doctor and he patched me up.

789
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,880
Well, the emergency trauma medicine, believe it or not, whatever they did for you.

790
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,020
If you knew a little bit about the human body, you would have got it.

791
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,659
You would have recovered three or four times faster on and on and on and on.

792
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,500
So it's just like they can print a legitimate, you know, silver dollar,

793
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,900
so to speak, but they're giving you a twenty dollar

794
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,460
value in silver or thirty dollar value in silver

795
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,420
on a coin that says it's got one dollar on it clearly says to me

796
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,659
nobody knows exactly what they're doing.

797
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,300
You know, I mean, yeah, they're the programming is really the most important.

798
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,620
Yeah. Yeah.

799
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,840
So and meanwhile, even though it's got a 20 or 30 dollar value,

800
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,719
you know, let's just say pragmatically and it says one dollar on it.

801
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,199
What is the value of the coin?

802
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,000
Go try to buy one. They're about 60 bucks a piece.

803
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,400
So as I said, you know, no, it's it's convoluted.

804
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,100
That's my point.

805
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,640
The money system is easy to figure out

806
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,360
if you just focus on what's been written about it

807
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,080
or what you can get someone to deliver about it, because

808
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,500
it's bizarre.

809
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,060
You see, even no matter how bizarre a notion is,

810
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,760
if it could be like rationally explained, anyone could understand it.

811
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,640
But what happens is people, the mainstream, which don't count

812
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,380
anyway, the majority don't count at all, meaning number.

813
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,060
They believe that the money system has to follow the rationale

814
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,320
that they've been taught to follow.

815
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,280
And anything that's outside that can't be true. Right.

816
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,420
The same look at the human body.

817
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,600
You know, they think they absorb things.

818
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,520
They think that, well, my the thing that I say about the human body,

819
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,300
of course, is that they they teach.

820
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,060
Even doctors think that the body is a pressurized filter bag. Right.

821
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,020
And it's not so anything outside of that can't be true.

822
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,240
So now we go into cognitive dissonance.

823
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,240
So. Well, right.

824
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,580
And it stands to reason that this is the way things are, because people,

825
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,520
even only a couple hundred years ago in this place they call the United States,

826
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,340
were arguing over whether there should be a debt based,

827
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,480
you know, fiat currency or a credit based fiat currency.

828
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,040
It's actually not debt based, debt based.

829
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,940
All right. Well, the reason they call it that was the public debate

830
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,760
because the receivership, the receivership came from that.

831
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,580
What it is, it's a an elastic currency, meaning it's value.

832
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,220
A rubber check, right? Elastic currency.

833
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,180
Yeah. And the supply of the money is increased by lending.

834
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,940
That's the most accurate way to do it.

835
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,440
But when you say debt based, it means that, yeah,

836
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,860
the U.S. could not pay its debt to the private bankers.

837
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,020
So they put the U.S.

838
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,660
into receivership that they could not get out of. Right.

839
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,660
But that's the consistent way that it's run now for what?

840
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,060
One hundred and eleven years since 1913, since 1933.

841
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,740
March the 9th.

842
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,780
Well, yeah, but the the not the receivership, but the situation

843
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,580
with the debt based, you know, currency being consistently

844
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,120
that came in in 1913.

845
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,720
Previous to that, we had two other centralized banks which were dissolved.

846
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,280
And they actually had the public argument between 1800

847
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,260
and that 1913 time that, you know, some people know about, say, Jackson.

848
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,020
You know, I think it was called the Bank of the United States, right?

849
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,840
There there was.

850
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,000
And there was yet another one previous to that, which had a similar sounding.

851
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,340
You know, they switch the names.

852
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,540
The key is when you hear of.

853
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,020
Yeah, well, it's just like the People's Democratic Republic

854
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,240
or the Republic Democratic People's Army or, you know, they switch.

855
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,440
Well, just like if state of Arizona, which is the Federal Reserve Corporation,

856
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,800
then you have Arizona state like New York state or state of New York.

857
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,260
There you go.

858
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,340
There's a big difference, right?

859
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,140
You enjoy it.

860
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,300
You have the state of Georgia, which is the corporate de facto.

861
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,780
But then you have Georgia state, right?

862
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,420
Just like when you speak about the sports you want, you'll say Georgia state.

863
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,220
Right. Right.

864
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,260
Which is the real side, which has nothing to do with the capital venture

865
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,860
that was the colony of Georgia.

866
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,740
If you take a look at the papers of incorporation that came along,

867
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,640
it still is still a colony in Georgia.

868
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,620
Well, it's funny how the nor a lot of the northern states

869
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,100
are still called called plantations. Right.

870
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,620
Yeah. But the southern states are called colonies.

871
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,180
Right. Still the colony.

872
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,420
But the idea was that it was actually initially a corporate venture.

873
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,920
It was a private business venture.

874
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:18,940
Really? That's right.

875
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,080
With a governor. Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,940
What was the captain of the ship? Yeah, exactly.

877
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,080
So but anyhow, as these things have transitioned, the monetary system

878
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,880
is a parallel, almost metaphorically.

879
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,140
And synonymous with with with the trajectory of all things, isn't it?

880
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,640
Because it's based on a falsified system

881
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:45,660
that really contains no value, but has scales for one to use

882
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,520
that allegedly transition what your labor into something

883
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,480
that is useful to make exchange in commerce.

884
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,040
So that you know, this ties in with a thought.

885
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,660
Someone said our humans made the you know, we're created

886
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,100
or made beings genetically modified, whatever genetically

887
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,040
occurred, occurring occurrences, not modified.

888
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,000
In other words, we were probably heavily modified

889
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,140
and then we put back together. Are we an experiment?

890
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm saying, no, it's not.

891
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,220
Humans are not an experiment at all.

892
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,200
But the social systems and the programming that's put on us is an experiment.

893
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,340
You see the difference, right?

894
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,160
So we're a substantiated being that's as I keep saying.

895
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,820
Let's say with the medical system or everything else they're doing,

896
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,580
it's a testament to the robustness of the human body.

897
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,000
Well, the question regarding that, just a little bit off track,

898
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,440
but relevant to what you just said in your opinion.

899
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,340
And this is about your opinion here.

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,660
I want to know about it here.

901
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,940
Or if you have a definitive answer, I'll take that as well.

902
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,980
Something that is empirical.

903
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,700
Is it possible, though, that we indeed are not simply the result

904
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,020
of a well thought out plan, but maybe the surviving experiment?

905
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,300
At one point, maybe we were an experiment

906
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,960
and we did end up thriving and being the most robust of the experiments.

907
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,780
You know, much like people talk about how Neanderthals

908
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,780
existed at the same time that Homo sapien was here.

909
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,680
And Chromagnon, Chromagnon, excuse me,

910
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,160
whichever the overlap was in the evolutionary naming.

911
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,300
Yeah, the Chromags are not none of that.

912
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,640
Archaics does a pretty good job on it.

913
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,460
I don't endorse him, but he does a good job with the Chromagnon.

914
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,280
They, you know, because it's been since the 80s when they found

915
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
there was a big leak.

916
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,760
It was in a magazine, too. I forgot which one it was.

917
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Those were the days where you went to a kiosk and there's magazines.

918
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,480
Yeah. One of the science.

919
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,800
Yeah. One of the popular science or popular mechanics or.

920
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,720
No, no, no, no.

921
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,200
It was a European magazine or an Australian magazine.

922
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,680
This is before the Australian magazine that's popular stuff.

923
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,160
These days, I was going to say I knew it was from a foreign country,

924
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,080
but I'm saying a magazine.

925
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,660
They were quite advanced, the Chromagnons.

926
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,620
Right. And one of our takes videos talks about how they had

927
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,460
they had suspenders, pants with buttons.

928
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,140
And yeah. Yeah.

929
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,080
But my point overall, though.

930
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,620
Yeah. But let's say the robustness.

931
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,660
No, what I'm saying is that we are not an experiment,

932
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,360
but what they make us do, what what we have become to do,

933
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,420
I should say, is experimental.

934
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, I think the biblical text describes and you can correct me here if I'm wrong.

935
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,180
But to my mind, the biblical text describes the idea that we were a creation

936
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,540
made from something that existed here already.

937
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,860
So it almost sounds as though there was genetic manipulation

938
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,700
for lack of a better term here.

939
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
And maybe there was more than one version.

940
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,660
You know, here's test a test.

941
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,260
Oh, of course.

942
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,080
And my and the my and Papa Vu, they made men out of wood.

943
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
But there were two.

944
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,060
I think they were made of metal first, but all they wanted to do was rebel

945
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,140
and they were made out of wood.

946
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,580
They were too cruel to each other.

947
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,760
So then they took some earth material and made them flesh.

948
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,520
And it's perfect.

949
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,760
The only thing is they were easily subdued or good slave race.

950
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,620
Flesh work, because it was more empathetic and could work collectively

951
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,040
and not spend its time on so much cold cruelty.

952
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,120
But right. So, I mean, that's kind of preserved in the biblical text

953
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,140
that there was sort of.

954
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
Does that seem like that's experiment?

955
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,440
There's my question to you is, is that experimentation?

956
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,460
And are we just the best results of the experiment?

957
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,240
There's no sign anywhere of experimentation.

958
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,280
There's trials. It's very, very solid.

959
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,620
I've referred to cloning.

960
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,220
Cloning is not as complicated, complicated, just like the money system.

961
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,600
It's not complicated at all.

962
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,240
Money is drawn from your signature, right?

963
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,260
Well, I was very, very simple.

964
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,080
It's very it's a very easy thing to do.

965
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,640
I don't want to start cloning chicken skin in my kitchen to prove a point.

966
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,700
No, no, please don't.

967
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
It was. Yeah, but it is.

968
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,980
It's a very simple process.

969
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,420
It doesn't require anything technological, just the right stuff.

970
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,860
Like most things.

971
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,760
Well, fair enough. But no, it's I insist that we're not an experiment,

972
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,240
but the social programming is experimental.

973
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,040
Absolutely. Well, just before we get there, just in your opinion

974
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,260
or if you have a empirical observation that that handles this,

975
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,620
is it possible, though, that again, those those evolutionary ancestors,

976
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,980
again, for lack of a better term, could they have been the experiments

977
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,720
that led to us? No, no, no.

978
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,560
It was hybridization. No, they were already pretty solid.

979
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,580
OK, actually, we've been you know, we've been degrading and a very easy

980
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,380
go find some films from the 1930s or 40s

981
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,180
where people are walking on the street, right?

982
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,540
Just like a documentary, right?

983
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,460
Not actors and makeup.

984
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,200
And then go look at a current video of people just walking in the street.

985
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,020
A documentary and look at the comparative analysis is structure,

986
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,520
the body structure, the posture, regular people, clear degradation,

987
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,280
look very different from what we see today.

988
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,200
And it's not just the and I could point out, I could point out

989
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,120
exactly what you should be looking for, the size of the ear,

990
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,440
small ear, OK, large ears, strong constitution

991
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,200
means you were born with a strong constitution that you can withstand more

992
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,040
a smaller ear.

993
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,460
Right. In general, in terms of average size is a weaker constitution.

994
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,640
Right. OK, so you don't recover as well.

995
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,560
Right. Look at the brow bone size.

996
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,360
Right. I was just going to say, look at the chin placement.

997
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,820
Placement of the eyes is significant, too, because it appears to me

998
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,940
as though there is more diversity

999
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,060
regarding eyes being too close together or too far apart,

1000
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,020
which makes them less efficient for triangulation.

1001
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,260
Sure. The mongoloid type.

1002
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,100
The well, that's when they're too close together.

1003
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,360
Yeah. So you can definitely see that there has been a transition here.

1004
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,060
Yeah. Degradation.

1005
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,280
In other words, the degradation is that we're weaker, much weaker

1006
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,860
in terms of constitution, meaning you can only take so much

1007
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,480
before you just peter out emotionally and physically.

1008
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,640
OK, so back to it, though, you're saying that the physicality of humanity

1009
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,080
is changing, is changing.

1010
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,520
It is not it didn't start out as an experiment, but the social orders

1011
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,740
and different things that have been applied.

1012
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,180
Oh, well, yeah, the change is degradation and it's

1013
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,080
the mind follows the body rule, right?

1014
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,440
Weak mind and the body gets weaker, right?

1015
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,860
And vice versa, vice versa.

1016
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,160
When it's at a certain point. Yeah. OK.

1017
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,460
So continuing on with this experimentation regarding social order

1018
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,280
and things like this, the monetary.

1019
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,160
That's where the experimentation is.

1020
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,360
Yeah. And it's clearly, as many have stated,

1021
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,080
one of the most unquestioned things in reality, right?

1022
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,840
I mean, people will question God, the nature of the universe, everything else.

1023
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,940
But think about it very carefully as you grow up.

1024
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,620
The majority of people never bother to question the why or how

1025
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,280
of the monetary system.

1026
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,400
It is more often than not accepted as this is just the reality of things.

1027
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,280
This is money. This is what you need to get things.

1028
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,860
Very basic principle.

1029
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,180
You might learn as a child that is less questioned again

1030
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,580
than even what what an atheist might say is an invisible man

1031
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,920
is angels, is spirits, well, unseen.

1032
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,280
Let's go back to the money.

1033
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,920
Maybe we'll wrap it up with this. Sure.

1034
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,360
The scarcity people feel that things are hard to get or things are not available.

1035
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,420
It's not true.

1036
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:28,180
It's the funds to get those things that is harder to get than itself.

1037
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,700
So how do you bypass that? Right. Lawfully.

1038
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,580
Right. But it's not not how do you let's do a step by step plan

1039
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,380
and get people to do it. No, no, no, no, no.

1040
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,540
Which bargain? How do you organize your mind?

1041
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,420
OK, let me just say it this way.

1042
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,740
This is an email experiment.

1043
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,720
OK, but barter and exchange is perfectly lawful to my understanding.

1044
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,600
I mean, if you know, there are other ways to do it, because if you are using

1045
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,060
if you, let's say, have a mortgage or.

1046
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,640
Or a debt and on a boat and you pay it off, use what people say,

1047
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,720
you don't pay even the paper, you satisfy it, right?

1048
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,500
Even though you think that you now there's no more, you've paid off the mortgage,

1049
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,460
you've paid off using regular terms, even though, you know, it's satisfied the loan.

1050
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,280
They still have an attachment to it because you're using their system to get it.

1051
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,140
So they always hold on to that. Oh, yeah. Right.

1052
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,200
So you have to clear that part first.

1053
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,360
But a direct and then yeah, but a direct barter either for labor

1054
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,140
or for material goods, I think is lawful.

1055
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,740
As so long as you have an agreement.

1056
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,760
I mean, yeah, but well, the way the system stands that if you're bartering

1057
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,700
something that at one point was purchased using fiat currency, it's open.

1058
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,940
It's subject to seizure.

1059
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,240
Well, I don't want to talk about legal seizure now, not forceful seizure.

1060
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,580
Right. But you have to understand how the lawful aspect works.

1061
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,420
And most people don't.

1062
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,260
But see, if you and I, I think lawfully, though, that this is acceptable in this

1063
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,460
scenario. Let's talk about the exchange of labor for something

1064
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,040
other than the fiat currency or something that is applicable to it.

1065
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,600
Right. Maybe I could decide that

1066
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,800
to have someone do the labor to rake my lawn is worth giving them lunch.

1067
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,800
I feed them a meal.

1068
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,600
No, no. We're talking more on a system that's more

1069
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,580
anyway. I, you know, you know, like someone, let's say a dentist, like,

1070
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,580
you know, we haven't exchanged any money ever.

1071
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,720
You know, I've known each other for almost 20 years now or 18 years.

1072
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,300
Right. And we go back and we're never exchanged any of the currency.

1073
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,060
Right. Right.

1074
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,400
And that's that's just a very narrow aspect.

1075
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,640
I'm speaking more on a broadband aspect.

1076
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,900
Right. Well, how would it be done?

1077
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,160
Right. Not on a narrow.

1078
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,120
You know, I'm just saying that on an individual basis.

1079
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,980
If you know that doesn't that we can't.

1080
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,840
Sorry, I don't want to go on the individual basis

1081
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,320
because then the preference aspect comes in too much. Right.

1082
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,500
In other words, personal preferences.

1083
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,220
That's like one of the keys.

1084
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,260
You know, you know, since we were

1085
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,520
doing O and G back in the day was a 2015 or something.

1086
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,300
Gosh, it's what did I always start saying?

1087
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,900
It's like, no, I don't want people calling in because, you know,

1088
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,340
there's a reason for it.

1089
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,580
And this is the there's several reasons when.

1090
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,460
And by the way, this ties in with a recent thing that popped up on YouTube.

1091
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,660
I guess they know we're doing something called podcasting.

1092
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,520
Now that I have a smartphone,

1093
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,140
it seems like when we do a recording, I'll get a YouTube thing, you know.

1094
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,440
Right. Anyway, so I can't figure out how to deactivate Siri completely.

1095
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,500
But what they one of the things was how to things to not do

1096
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,440
if you have a podcast is tell personal stories. Right.

1097
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
Do you remember back in the O and G in 2015?

1098
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,600
I said like when no one cares about your own personal habits or personal

1099
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,040
unless it matters to them specifically. Right. Right.

1100
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,840
So whenever you that's why this whole thing about opinion,

1101
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,940
even if you look at what were the the most popular opinionated,

1102
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,700
let's say, what would you call a television show, a radio show, whatever?

1103
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,340
A podcast podcast don't really do it.

1104
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,040
Were the ones that were the most circus like.

1105
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
Like, what was it? The Jerry Springer show.

1106
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,500
The there were others of the Sally McBee.

1107
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,160
Was it Sally, Sally, Jesse Raphael and all that. Yeah.

1108
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,100
Those are all personal, very personal stories,

1109
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,740
but they quickly degraded into circus acts, didn't they? Right. Right.

1110
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,480
Well, podcasts are very personalized, but because there is no argument on them.

1111
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,540
Drama lacks the drama. Yeah, go ahead.

1112
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,560
Yeah. But if you but if you let's say you're doing a sonic event,

1113
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,400
no one really cares about the personal aspect of of anyone.

1114
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,620
And I've I learned this and this goes back to the barter and the trade,

1115
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,260
why I don't care about the what we can be barter trade on a personal level.

1116
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,060
It's how do you create a system in people's minds?

1117
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,580
Because it's always has to be a general thing,

1118
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,720
because when I used to speak publicly in person with an audience of 50 people

1119
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,460
at a breakfast club, they would ask me to speak. Right.

1120
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,060
When when I would stand up at the dais at the podium to speak with a microphone,

1121
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,500
the host would get up or and say, OK, Greek's going to speak for an hour.

1122
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,040
And then you could ask questions.

1123
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,480
And the moment the people were told they could ask questions,

1124
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,220
they all perked up because they're like, oh, good,

1125
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,720
I'm going to act like I'm listening and when I wait for him to shut up

1126
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,000
so I can get the microphone and say what I want to say. Right. Right.

1127
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,820
You see. So when is he going to shut up?

1128
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,740
Right. So I can get the microphone.

1129
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,780
So it's not about what you say, I say, he says, she says, how can

1130
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,660
just put out a general this is on the email, but this is also something

1131
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,120
that is so simple that people naturally default to.

1132
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,700
How often I've seen this all my entire life.

1133
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,200
Whenever you've been in a car and it gets a flat tire, everyone is super chill.

1134
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,900
Everyone, whether the passengers are super chill.

1135
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,480
Oh, we got a flat. OK, let's get the spare.

1136
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,860
No big deal. Right.

1137
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,080
Could you imagine? Oh, no, we got a flat.

1138
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,020
What are we going to do?

1139
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,960
No one does that. Right.

1140
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,920
There's just all right. We got a flat.

1141
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,560
Let's get the spare. Like, no big deal. You see what I mean?

1142
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,500
Then there's no reason for personal drama.

1143
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,960
There's no reason for what you think. I think. Right. Yeah.

1144
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,860
It's just who's going to get down and do it.

1145
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,180
So just like the spare time.
