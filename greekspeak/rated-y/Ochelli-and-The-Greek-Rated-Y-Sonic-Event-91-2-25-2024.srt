1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:15,219
Rated Y sonic event 91. And here we are once again, Greek, how you doing tonight?

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,480
Doing okay. I just want to address a lot of talk in the chat about the new moon. And I think it's

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,820
the 13th moon this year. Just by the way it appeared, I would like to have it measure out as

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:37,420
being the first month. But didn't look like a big enough moon to be the first month. So we'll see.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,020
I'll just put that out. What it'll do is it'll shift a lot of the observational days way later

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,360
more than in previous years. But that's what a 13th moon can do.

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,160
But there's a fast acceleration. If you look at 2024 full moon calendar, and you know,

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:04,120
it's procrastinates, procrastinates, what prognosticates for knowledge of what's coming,

9
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,120
you'll see that we this week, I mean, this week, this week's accelerate, meaning the

10
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,840
moon starts to happen in the middle of the month almost, so it really tightens up really fast.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,940
So instead of it, the full moon kind of corresponding with the end of the month on

12
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,720
the Pope's work schedule starts happening more towards the middle of the month,

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,000
almost as if you lose two weeks, it speeds up. It's really interesting to watch.

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,000
And that happens after, let's say, the fall, you'll start seeing it accelerate towards a 12

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,020
month year. So it's too soon. Well, I wouldn't call it till the next moon, but I'd call it enough

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,120
that it's the 13th moon, I would suggest. So I just want to bring that up because it seems to

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,600
be a big deal. And one of the Greek speak things lawful timekeeping. And it's not because of any

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,080
religious practice. It's just because nothing really works on the Pope's work schedule. Right.

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,180
Well, you got to find a way that does. Right. Well, also, you know, what do you talk about

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,740
all the time? Why not ground yourself or make give access to yourself the things that are

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,840
of the best quality? What is the best quality? Well, to do something that can be reckoned

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,540
objectively, you know, because arbitrarily, you know, who's to say that it's actually 1 a.m.,

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,320
12 p.m., you know, according to these these markers that they give us on what you used to

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,420
say was the plastic windup toy, right? You know, the windup toy or the. Yeah, but they're also

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,860
divided. You know, if you study the Greek, well, they call it Julian calendar date. That's what

26
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,560
it still is, really. Yeah. I'll tell you, the day starts at noon and the full moon is is the month

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:47,720
monthly timekeeper in their in astronomical time or astronomy. One on one. So this is have

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,820
they spend a little bit of time on timekeeping, just, you know, very little. But they do. They

29
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,020
do it. Yeah. So it's split. Right. Just like you have legal and lawful. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Split.

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,240
You know what you give the people. You know what the old dictionary is. When you looked up the

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,340
word oats, it said what we feed horses in England. But it's the staple of the people in Scotland.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,660
It's kind of like a little dig where you put down or whatever. Yeah. So, yeah, that that's an

33
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,380
interesting dig in the put down. I got a message which is interesting about people. If you just

34
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,180
remove a little bit, they really become space heaters and like pretty much. Yeah. And that

35
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,020
leads me to the without no pun here, the concept of leadership versus management. Right. Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,100
Because what what happens is it's not the same thing. A manager is there to make sure that

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,540
everything's done by the book. There's no inventiveness, really. There's quality control

38
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:56,260
to a degree. And it's not voluntary where a leader doesn't have a playbook and usually is voluntary.

39
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,940
And half the time a leader is the one going into new territory. Right. So but, you know,

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,400
if you go into enough new stuff, you'll find out, you know, it's preexisting anyway. Just

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,360
it's called rediscovery. So what happens in this human society is it's being managed by managers

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,800
and the people falling for it. They don't know what real leadership is. Right. To to put forward,

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,400
you know, OK, look at trends. Trends would be the easiest thing, you know, music, fashion,

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,440
whatever, food, diets. That is more of a management scenario, not a leadership scenario.

45
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,260
The same with politics. Those are management scenarios. The political parties are management

46
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,800
scenarios, not leadership. Right. Well, again, it depends on where you come into it, because like

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,120
with music, when you come into it and you're hearing what's already being released, approved

48
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,500
monetized, et cetera, it's already passed a whole bunch of points where it's different.

49
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
In other words, OK, no, not that not not the actual grind of how it's put out.

50
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:11,760
Well, what I'm speaking of more is the the metaphor that I used to give years ago was education. If you

51
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,320
had a real education system that taught real stuff, no one would go and no one would understand what

52
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,360
the hell was being said. Right. Because they've it's a it's so radically different than what

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,200
they've been used to. Just like, for example, if you look at the education system, you know,

54
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,240
you can look at the history of the current public school, even private school. They follow very much

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,420
the same thing. It came out of certain places in history where the industrialists said, you know,

56
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,220
we don't want creativity. We want productivity. Right. So that's all about management. And clearly,

57
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:56,060
the system. OK, the system of industry is failing because of the new techno feudalism to coin,

58
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,620
to paraphrase a term by Yanis Varoufakis, it's this techno feudalism. Right. That is going in.

59
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,860
And it's what it's doing is it's swallowing its embrace and not embracing. But, yes,

60
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,700
it's encompassing all of industry, but it's putting it into a new system,

61
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:26,380
which is a feudal system. Right. Right. Where the technology now is the new manager versus

62
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,400
the industry. Still no leadership. There's no leadership. Well, isn't that because technology

63
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,280
allows you to streamline the all of the aspects of managing people, basically? I mean,

64
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,400
you know, technology, you know what? Let's get real. Let's get specific on this, because what

65
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm saying is it carries a lot of specific points to it to make it more clear, not just to underscore

66
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,320
it, because if you say techno feudalism, just about anyone who hears that will agree. But the

67
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,920
underscoring of that is this. What makes it different is let's just start off with the

68
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,340
industrial part of the industrial thing people think is factories and whatever. No, it's not

69
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,980
part of the industrial thing is that they've convinced people that you must have money to

70
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,100
get anything you want or whatever you want versus directly getting it right. So now when

71
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,780
scarcities and shortages are created with the monies, you end up with a scarcity and shortage

72
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,540
with everything else, even though there is no scarcity or shortage with anything else. Right.

73
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,660
So that's the pitfall of industry. Most people when you say industrialism, they think

74
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,040
factories and production. Yes, it is. But the crux of this, this has not been said by anyone

75
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,140
before, by the way, is that everyone has been convinced that they need this fiat currency

76
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:48,080
credit to get things right. Hence, hence the utilities, you know, you pay for utilities

77
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,320
when they're already paid for. Right. So okay, so that's the crux of another crux of techno feudalism

78
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:05,500
is this. They have a sensor when I mean sensor, meaning with an S, like a sensor that detects

79
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,940
things, something that you write. Yeah. Whether it's artificial intelligence, it speaks to you

80
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:18,260
like a Siri or whatever, or a query that you type in questions or monitoring data of your searches.

81
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,980
What it does is it sees what you're interested in, which is limited because you're not a product

82
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,820
of leadership. You're a product of management. So it's very easy to put you could be

83
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,799
to determine who you are, what category. Right. And it gathers that data and then it gives

84
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,400
suggestions to you backward back. And then it sees which suggestions you grab.

85
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,680
And then it starts to do algorithms that make its suggestions more efficient, because

86
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,320
if it gives you 10 out of things, 10 suggestions and you go for them, it's pretty efficient. But

87
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,660
if it gives you 10 suggestions and you go for one, it says, oh, we only have 10 percent efficiency.

88
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,920
Let's start looking at him a little closer so we can get our efficiency higher. So this algorithm

89
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,860
now is getting more and more efficient about making suggestions to you and you start using

90
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,260
its suggestions. This is what advertisers wanted to do. And now it watches what you do and it gets

91
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:24,100
more input from you. So basically, like Yanis Varoufakis says, you train the the the algorithm

92
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,860
and then the algorithm trains you and then you go back and train the algorithm some more.

93
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,620
Then the algorithm comes back and trains you some more. Right. Because it's slowly leaning

94
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,620
you to certain directions that you don't realize very subtly. Right. Of course. Right. So this is

95
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:44,820
what I mean by techno feudalism. In other words, you are now in a fiefdom where you have no free

96
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:53,960
thinking, but it's not upfront. It has come through your the premise. Well, like I said,

97
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,160
you're a managed being. You're not you're not a being that works through leadership

98
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,120
because you're managed. The playbook is there. And remember, there's no innovation in management.

99
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,620
Right. So it already knows that about you. You don't know that about you, that you're

100
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,240
pretty much conventional. You know, that's why I say people in the collective, the normies,

101
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,220
they're so convinced they're so predictable, right. Very predictable and undiscerning,

102
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,040
even though that's never you never say that to them. Right. What you do is you tell them they're

103
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,320
all great. They're all individual. They'll have talent. Bullshit. None of them. Very few do. Right.

104
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,120
So so that that's part of the captive system of an industry, not techno feudalism. Techno feudalism

105
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,640
is very different. It's on a very personal level. Right. But it's impersonal because there's a finite

106
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,820
number of things that can offer to you. But that's OK, because you don't know any better. Right.

107
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,080
So when you go to when you go to Amazon or eBay or whatever, Twitter, Facebook or whatever,

108
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,680
I see those things as really limited, like, oh, my gosh, this is what people are doing. But the

109
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,480
people that are part of that system, the majority, they see it as an unlimited amount of options.

110
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:10,440
Right. So just because there's a billion websites or whatever doesn't mean that it's not like

111
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,040
limited. You know, it's just a lot of quantity. The quality that I'm looking for is just isn't

112
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,220
there. Very rare. The people don't know that. So they're caught still in a managerial system.

113
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,600
And and I'm not trying to say that techno feudalism is leading them at all. No,

114
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,940
it's implementing a mind capture. Right. Because remember, they're already locked

115
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,840
in the industrial system where they don't know that there's no scarcity of anything,

116
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,440
but they do feel the scarcity because when they see their bank account change. Right.

117
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,020
Because they're only in the training and the knowledge that if they want anything,

118
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,420
whether it's a vacation, food, electric power, clothing, whatever they need to get credit,

119
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,980
paper or cards, digital transfer to get it, they don't know that that is absolutely not necessary.

120
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,600
Right. Well, because the interaction, the interaction in and of itself is not just a

121
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,660
matter of control, but it's also a matter of refining that control. So every interaction

122
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,860
gives another piece of data, another piece of information with the techno feudalism.

123
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,560
But the techno feudalism wraps up all the pitfalls and limitations that have been put on people that

124
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,640
they don't see as limitations by from industry, the industrial age and their various industrial

125
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
age. And by the way, the information age is one of the shortest ages ever because you're not in

126
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,880
the information age anymore. I think that died in around 2013. What what people that especially

127
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,920
the alternative communities or whatever, the heyday of the Internet ended around 2013. Right.

128
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,160
2012 around there. Right. That's when the censorship started. Yeah. So that's when the

129
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,300
information age ended. You're not in the information age anymore. You're more than

130
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:59,240
10 years into techno feudalism. Yeah. Speaking of which. Yeah. So this is pretty this is a big drop.

131
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,300
I haven't I've never brought this topic up before. And I'll get more into the development of how I'm

132
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:13,200
observing it. I like Yanis Varoufakis stuff, but he's a left winger. You know, he's political.

133
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,940
He doesn't know. He doesn't. He's anti banker the way they're doing. So he never talks about

134
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,300
the crux of the banking system. You know what it really is. He can't because he's an ex-politician.

135
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,740
He's easy to reach, by the way. He seems to be a pretty OK guy. So he's he was the former finance

136
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,840
minister of Greece. So let me just say one more thing. How does this affect where we're going in

137
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,060
future? It doesn't because what we're what we're going to be going into in the future is a revival

138
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,440
of some very ancient things that no one that everyone has forgotten about. Right. But this

139
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,840
is just a tag along. This is what your day to day is now. Technical techno feudalism. So, yeah,

140
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,360
just keep in mind that it has not replaced industrialism, which the crux of industrialism

141
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,400
in modern socialism is that you need money to get anything that you want to get. Right. Which

142
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,980
is a fallacy. But wasn't there always through the use of, you know, technology advancement,

143
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,320
whatever, force multipliers one way or another, there was always a an elite control over the

144
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,780
people one way or another, you know, controlling knowledge, feudalism, fiefdoms. Yeah. Like,

145
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,360
for example, if you go back before the year 1700, there were no jobs. Right. There were no jobs.

146
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,280
Nobody looked for you. So a job, even 150 years ago, a job meant someone that worked on something,

147
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,220
it was an order. So if you worked in furniture, and a job would be a custom chair, like this chair

148
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,580
that you're doing as a job, right. So now they replaced all these little projects, the things

149
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,340
that you productions with an overall encompassing thing called Do you have a job? Yeah, I have a

150
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,100
job, I have to mop the floor. And then I don't have a job, right? That's not what it means anymore.

151
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,540
But there was no jobs back in the days, because it was a fiefdom. You did what you did. And that's

152
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,140
what you did. You didn't know any better. You didn't know anything else, right? If you were a

153
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,820
baker, right, you made breads and pastries. The reason you did that is because your father was a

154
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,860
baker, right? You didn't know any different. That's what you did. Right. And you you you

155
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,320
are in society, however, you're in society, even they had bread factories, you know, they even

156
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,580
you could look this up, there are bread factories in Rome that had 2000 people working there making

157
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:39,540
million loaves a day, right? So back in ancient times, but that was not a job. They didn't know

158
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,700
anything else. It wasn't like I'm going to lose my job. Or, you know, I need a job. You just did

159
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,680
what you knew. Right? It's very different. And this is sort of a little bit of a revival after

160
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,680
the COVID thing about you know, everyone, like don't show up to work, work out or your work at

161
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,400
home. Yeah, right. Yeah. So you can't really hang out by the water cooler anymore. Now you're at

162
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,220
home. So you're only going to be tasked to do what you know, there's no more like punch in

163
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:12,660
and hang out. You know, if you don't produce what you know, or what you what you're there for,

164
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,260
because of what you know, you're you're going to be fired. So it is a little of a change. But it's

165
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,760
part of the fiefdom. It's all a fiefdom. So it's quite interesting, but it has nothing to do with

166
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,660
the things that I've talked about over the years of what calamities are going to be facing

167
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,480
society. So but it's just a point that I wanted to make, because that's you're in it now for

168
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,880
since the end of the heyday of the internet, I'd say was around 2010 to 2013. By 2014 or 15,

169
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,440
it was pretty clear that the internet was no longer a free place, you know what I mean?

170
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,820
Or free as free as we thought it to be, let's say, right? Well, that's when all of a sudden,

171
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,960
it seemed as though all of a sudden, the Wild West of it was all gone. You know, you had a lot

172
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,840
of freedom at first, it seemed like you could do anything or say anything online, in your own little

173
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:07,359
corner in your own little way. The only what the only problem was, you had to gain access, right?

174
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,300
And you had to have a couple of pieces of hardware, and you could do whatever you wanted,

175
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,359
it seems or you could go to the library, or whatever, or you don't have to have here's the

176
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,560
thing. It doesn't matter if you have it in your home, you just need you just need to know someone

177
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,300
who has a car, right? You don't need to you don't need money, you just need to know someone who has

178
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,000
money, you don't need food, you just need to know someone who has food, right? Well, yeah, of course,

179
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,560
because look, I'm just talking about access, not really about whether you whether you own it or

180
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,540
not, or you have it in your home. So sure, but the access was very prolific. And right now,

181
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,800
it's in your pocket, right? Stupid rectangle, and I'm using one right now. I don't get into

182
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,000
it like a lot of other people do. I can't see how people could stare at the rectangle all day,

183
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,400
I've seen people do. Because it's not that interesting. Again, I use it as a telephone,

184
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,080
I use it to between Skype and email and whatever. And that's it. I can't see how people could stare

185
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:07,060
at it. I found out recently I was out. And I saw some people sitting down there staring at it.

186
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,280
And I walked up to the side and they were actually watching a movie. Oh my gosh,

187
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,960
how can you watch a movie on the frickin? Anyway, yeah, no, I've seen that. Yeah,

188
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,320
you know, just really quick on that. It is fascinating to me that as the ease of access

189
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,940
appears to be there, right? It seems like you have the access to go and examine anything,

190
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,440
explore anything. And people stare at these things. Oh, not really. Not anymore. Well,

191
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,960
anymore. And if the 12 2013 I don't think you can explore anything anymore. Well,

192
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,000
I find it very limiting. Okay, fair enough. That's the limiting limited compared to that was

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,920
how many times have you done? Well, let's say you do research in any field. And I mean research,

194
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,040
like, you know, look up what's been memorialized completely subject. You go online, you'll see

195
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,300
the a lot of the websites that you might have pulled up before 2010 are gone. And the information

196
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:07,120
is gone. Google does not show share or show things in searches that get used to look at the

197
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,720
content, the the stuff that's out there is larger, there's more pages, actually, there's more stuff

198
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,480
out there. There's actually a lot more. It doesn't matter. I realized that the actual

199
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,520
quality of the information has been limited. But I'm just saying the actual, you know, the

200
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,100
um, well, of the quantity is actually larger. In reality,

201
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,180
there are more people in whatever town you live in right now. But the amount of people you could

202
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,980
have an interesting conversation with is about the same as it was 30 4050 years ago, right?

203
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,540
Very few. Yeah, no, forget about it. And that's what I was just about to get to is that as that

204
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,420
has gotten easier, and you point out that, you know, everybody's got a phone, right? So they

205
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,200
have access in their pocket. Now, you didn't even have to, you don't have to go sit down at the

206
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,480
library with a big computer and get access even sure. And the reason I'd say yes, everybody's

207
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,060
got a phone is because I have one now when when I didn't have one a few months ago, if you said

208
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,480
that I'd beg to differ, right? Right? Of course, now that I have one every now I'm part of the

209
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,820
everybody was like, Oh, my gosh, it scares me sometimes. Well, I didn't go get one steadily

210
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,660
until I went to go to Dallas again. For years. I didn't have Yeah, yeah, it was about you got

211
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,400
one. What? This past year? Have you had it more than a year? No, no, I got it. Yeah, I got it.

212
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,580
Just before I was going to go to Dallas, which was November, I might have got it in September

213
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,160
or something like that. Or somewhere in there. Because I got it. I remember because I gave you

214
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,680
the number. And you know, the conversation we're having right now about the phones is silly,

215
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,920
because many people listening have had one for more than a decade or so. Oh, yeah, definitely.

216
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,960
Well, they I don't know how long they've had them. I had one earlier and got rid of it. You know,

217
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,220
I didn't want it anymore. Because it just I didn't see the point I threw it across the room when it

218
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,300
was about five years ago. I got an old Motorola and I just threw it across the room. And that was

219
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,480
it. Yeah, I think it was might have been 10 years ago. I said forget it. I can't do this anymore.

220
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,880
Because it was just pointless. There was no reason to have it. But what's weird to me and here's an

221
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,560
honest open question. I have no idea. This is something I don't know. Wouldn't that affect I

222
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,780
know what affects people's brains for sure. To be staring at that thing all the time. But it's

223
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,840
gotta be affecting their eyes too. Because I mean, look, my eyes are very sensitive to stuff.

224
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,420
Well, it's different. It's different than if you grew up a year old enough sat in front of regular

225
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,800
CRT television, you know, the gun tube, right? Yes, don't you know, ruin your eyes, right?

226
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,580
Children get them further away at least six feet. Because of the energy coming off of it.

227
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,380
Well, of course, that was a constant. Anytime I was near a TV, I always tended to

228
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,040
more mechanical that also had well, it was quite well known back then from the

229
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,380
crazy, fringe conspiracy theories. Oh, they're sending stuff through the TV that right,

230
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,880
right. And they did. It was a lot of research that you go into an alpha state very quickly

231
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,300
in a conscious alpha state very quickly watching the old tube, right? Yeah. So the new tubes,

232
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,600
there's no tube now it's a flat screen. It has another aspect to it. Right? I'm not I haven't

233
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,860
researched it or looked into it. I don't know who to trust about it. For me. It's the sensors that

234
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,000
are built into it. Okay, there's the better phones, actually, most of the phones that are

235
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,320
the main, you know, Samsung, iPhone, or they've got dozens of sensors, temperature, heart rate,

236
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,400
movement, voice, sound, not just the microphone, right? Right. To gather data? Well, why would you

237
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,320
gather all that heart rate temperature? I mean, for what reason? There's got to be another reason

238
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,460
for gathering that right to create? What do you call it when you have a target or someone you want

239
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,560
to do something to you get gathered information now you can you know what to use on them? Right?

240
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,220
Kind of thing. Right. So yeah, so I don't Is it nefarious? Yeah, definitely is nefarious. Is it

241
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,660
outwardly harmful? I don't think so. But there are people that came down with quote unquote COVID.

242
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,520
Yeah, I've heard of more than one when they got a new device, a new phone or a tablet or something,

243
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,560
they got sick immediately the same day they got the device. Well, back in the days of the big old

244
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,500
box, that was, you know, the thing that was a tube. And you know, it was about the flicker rate,

245
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,480
you were talking about the alpha and this and that, you know, you had a flicker rate.

246
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,500
Still, there is a flicker rate on these things. Yeah, yeah. But it was more obvious with the

247
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,420
black and white TV, there was a process to the way it was made. And that created a slightly

248
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,220
progressive scan. And yeah, that had a progressive scan, right. And then the other

249
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,680
one actually had a flick, it just actually flashed, it was quick succession of flashes.

250
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,220
And as you well know, just like with strobe lights, you can induce different mental states

251
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,080
with different strobing and stuff like that. Now there's that aspect of it. Yeah, but I think it's

252
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,600
much more nefarious because of all the various sensors, right? Well, yeah, also location and

253
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,040
all that. Well, yeah, there was a point at which that stuff started going the other direction,

254
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,200
like it was going all one way at one point, and just beaming out to people, and it would have

255
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,020
effects on them. And that was the end of it. But now it's the loop is complete, it goes back to

256
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,660
and at that time, there was carry. Yeah, but but they're what I'm trying to say, though.

257
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,920
Okay, when I said people got COVID, I'm not talking about what they say COVID is,

258
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,700
people during that era, that year of 2020 came down with a very severe illness very rapidly,

259
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,140
and they acquired a new phone or tablet. Well, in a lot of cases, that was more cognitive to that.

260
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,480
That's the weird thing. They said it was, you know, why is it that you feel out of it? Why do

261
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,140
you have this brain fog going on? Oh, well, that's because you got this respiratory. Let me just

262
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,400
address this. Yeah. Okay. It's not that I'm talking about a. Okay, let me give an example.

263
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,400
There was a show in one of the convention centers here in Tucson. This is after they announced the

264
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,500
that week. And pretty much majority of the people in there got sick within a few minutes and went

265
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,400
outside of the building. They didn't know what was happening to them. Some of them went to a

266
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,440
medical person and said, Oh, that's radiation. We subject to microwaves, right? And so they

267
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,260
obviously did something, you know, and then they said the people had COVID. You see what I mean?

268
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,440
It's not. But if you do the math on the how much power is in the phone,

269
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,940
there is enough power in there if they have the right frequency and the bandwidth to make you ill

270
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,560
to actually hurt your body. Right. And this has been every Nokia was the one that emphasized it

271
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,880
more than others. When you when you've got a phone, even the old cell phones, it came with a

272
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,600
little instruction manual and it had a big cautionary. Don't put it on your head. Don't

273
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,940
check. Right. All this other stuff. If you're pregnant, if you're right. Yeah, it was it was

274
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,680
funny to me because it's like everybody's holding those things to their head because every you know,

275
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,780
everybody used to put. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it started off on a bad foot. And also years ago,

276
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,200
when the cell phones were new, the frequencies they used for cell phones were banned by the

277
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,800
military because it was damaging the people that were using them. But they freed up those.

278
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,000
They freed those frequencies up for the public. So, yes, is it nefarious? Yes, it is. But what

279
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm trying to say is I have heard from several instances, several cases that the phones and

280
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,660
tablets, you know, anything handheld device, whatever those watches also. Right. Yeah.

281
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,540
Can propagate illness. Right. An ill state of being, you know, that could kill you or make

282
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,840
you feel like you have a severe fever, just like any type of infection. And it can induce an

283
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,760
infection. So, you know, that's a very interesting thing. Is that just through the electromagnetic

284
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,900
fields? Because that's an obvious. I believe it's a mixture of electromagnetic and non electromagnetic

285
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,280
magneto electric, which is not electromagnetic. Magneto electric is different. Right. Magneto

286
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,660
electric is would be you set off a pulse. And then when that pulse hits the object,

287
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,840
it produces electricity where electromagnetic is when the electricity from the device hits you.

288
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,420
It produces a magnetic effect. Very different. Right. That's the kind of thing within proximity

289
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,820
you get. You get into an area where there's sort of a cloud of this that's constantly flowing.

290
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,160
That's one thing. And then the the electromagno is a is a particular burst, like just a

291
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,200
something. Magneto, magneto electric is far more dangerous because it will create an electrical

292
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,740
field to impulse in the body where the magnetic field will not be as harmful. Electromagnetic

293
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,400
will not be as harmful as a magneto electric. It's kind of like

294
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,860
we're constantly bathing in all sorts of electromagnetic fields that you can

295
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,560
know. There's the magneto electric ones that'll mess you up. You see, this is kind of like phasing.

296
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,160
I think I brought this up a while back and we had someone with more than three sharpened pencils in

297
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,620
their pocket that put a comment. I'm glad someone did reach out, put a comment, because most people

298
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:55,880
don't understand this type of phase modulation. If you are at in a room and you're turning the

299
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,160
light on, off, on, off, on, off your little children, right. They discover lights which

300
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,800
are on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off. And I'm in the other room, but I'm not turning it on,

301
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,320
off. I'm going off, on, off, on, off, on. Now, obviously, on and off, on and off, on and off.

302
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,860
And off, on, off, on. Most people say you're doing the same thing. No, it's not. It's very

303
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,740
different. It's phase modulation. So I've ventured during this spot. We may be, I don't know,

304
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,740
somehow without getting it. OK, I don't want to get into what's called technical sonic events,

305
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,020
explain certain technical things I have with the body, I have with water to a certain degree.

306
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,440
But I've not gotten deep. And I think a lot of people would shy away if we turned it in any,

307
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,560
just in general now, sonic that was sounded technical. Notice I said sounded technical

308
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,520
because I would break it down in a very simple way, the way I think of it. Right. So, for example,

309
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,340
if you go to a place where there are rocket scientists or nuclear physicists, before you

310
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,300
approach like, oh, this is really the average person would be. I was very intimidating. You know,

311
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,320
I don't know. But when you go, let's say you were to go and spend a few days with these guys,

312
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,160
you'd be like, oh, they broke everything down into a real simple way of thinking about it. Right.

313
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,500
The same with a neurosurgeon. Like if I say, you know, this guy's a brain surgeon. Right.

314
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,280
Well, I've had many I've had over 20 hours discussion with a neurosurgeon. And until,

315
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,760
you know, most people, again, would be intimidated. Let's go talk to a neurosurgeon for hours. I don't

316
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,700
know. What do I know about it? Right. Because they're intimidated. Right. Well, once you spend

317
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,580
time with them, you'll see that he had to break all that stuff down. It's a very common, easy.

318
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,620
Right. Well, they get intimidated because of the terminology, which is common among people that

319
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,880
are engaged in that. Right. Like what is the biggest problem with understanding the body and

320
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,240
certain things that happen? Well, the problem is you're without using the terminology that

321
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,520
sounds intimidating because it's your right. There's a jargon. There you go. Just like with

322
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,560
you know, why are you so confused about the court papers? Because of the legalese,

323
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,180
the way that they're talking is what's confusing you. What's happening is not that difficult to

324
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,500
understand. Sure. But, you know, when they say, well, yeah, well, I would with the neurosurgeon,

325
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:07,400
I prove that the what you cannot create pure distilled water. It's a long story. Maybe we'll

326
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,900
get it. But in short, when cranium replacements were like when when a whole you have to remove

327
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,940
a piece of skull from the head to do brain surgery, they put the piece back. Right. And

328
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,840
it only took in America. If you were in South America, it didn't take it took in or in Canada

329
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,820
also. But if it didn't take if you're in South America, like it would infect. So they would just

330
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,580
remove it and put a piece of fiber like a mesh there and you'd have a soft spot on your head.

331
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,980
Right. OK. And I said, well, what kind of irrigation, you know, because you during

332
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,800
surgery, I don't want to get technical and see, I would say it's called irrigation when you flush

333
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,220
something. Right. Right. And just like the irrigation for your garden. But

334
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,920
they have an irrigation machine set up with distilled water and all that. I said that

335
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,620
distilled water is not distilled from the type of water quality that it was distilled in the

336
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,580
Northern Continent. If you switch, let's say you got Deer Park. Well, you know, the regular like

337
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,440
some real Deer Park is like a very common bottled water. They make most bottled water, you know,

338
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,540
make distilled water varieties. Also, you know, the Poland Springs used to be fine.

339
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,520
Right. Poland Spring used to be big. Aquafina is pretty large. Yeah. Coca-Cola or whatever. But

340
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,740
they the ones that are more utilitarian offer distilled water. And they come from actual

341
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:33,120
springs where in South America, the distilled water is more river water. So even though it's

342
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,420
twice, even if it's deionized, it still has the frequency. So of the creatures that lived

343
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:45,280
in the river. So when you irrigate and during surgery with water that's scientifically shown

344
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,700
to have nothing in it other than water, that water, the frequency and the energy and the

345
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,560
memory of it from being in a river, once it goes into the person's body, right where it's been

346
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,160
cleaned up. Right. The organisms now the body is warm and it offers all these nutrients.

347
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:07,860
The water will start producing the organisms you find in a river on your skull. And what's going to

348
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,880
happen is your body is going to see that as something it has to fight off as an infection.

349
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,020
Right. So so you'll end up with an infection. But if you use water that was extracted from

350
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:27,580
underground, it will start to reproduce those by those things that live underground, which are not

351
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,840
harmful at all. Right. Just like, for example, someone posted, you know, in the chat, you know,

352
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,300
turning plastic into oil. It's like full circle. Right. The rock oil. Right. OK. Yeah. Basically,

353
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,760
the water underground assists in making oils and things like that, petroleum or whatever.

354
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,740
So when you have the spring water garnered from a spring versus river water,

355
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,940
the body will then the water, once it's in the body, which has nutrients and heat and electrical

356
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,280
current, will start producing the organisms that are from underground, which are not harmful and do

357
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,760
not the body does not see as an infection, because, for example, river water. We're not

358
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,080
talking we're talking like river water. Right. That has like old fecal matter. Fish live in it.

359
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,260
There's amoebas, parrots, protozoa. And we'll start producing all that stuff. So you have an

360
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,760
infection. So when they switched to using imported what they couldn't find, they kept asking, like,

361
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,760
why do you want to know where the water comes from? It's distilled. No, no, no. We didn't know

362
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,920
comes from. So they said, oh, it's not good enough. We need to get water that comes from

363
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,920
an underground spring that's been distilled. And once they switch to that, then the cranium,

364
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,440
the mandible or whatever bones were, they would fuse and they would take no infection.

365
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:45,040
This is becoming I don't know if it's going to take. Anyway, this is a product of my discussions

366
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,820
with someone a few years ago. Anyway, just scratch that part just to say someone else. Right. I never

367
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:59,580
talk about personal stuff. But so what I what I'm trying to say here is we had a lab where if you're

368
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,080
discussing with someone now we're going to still water it, that distilled water is distilled water.

369
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,159
They don't want to hear anything else. But if you say the source of that water matters and here's

370
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,780
the proof. Well, we have the proof now. You see. So I learned. How do you write a short story? How

371
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,300
I learned about water frequency and water memory from a neurosurgeon. Right. So so this goes back.

372
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,900
So he benefited. And now I benefited because we have a case. Right. We have many examples where.

373
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,139
Right. So I got you. Very interesting. That's something to keep in mind, because

374
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,080
some of these other, you know, alleged what they refer to often is spring water.

375
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,480
Some of it didn't just come from the underground source. Right. There's the above ground source

376
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,280
as well, which is, you know, basically melting snow. Yeah. Yeah. But it just so happens that

377
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,420
practice what you would do. Rock formation. If you were to set up a water, the ground,

378
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,699
ground spring water, that you would have to look at their practices.

379
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,000
In other words, the general practices in other places, which is to get any water or, you know,

380
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,780
clean water sources where if you find that a particular company, what was the ones you

381
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:11,260
mentioned? Poland Spring or a few of them. Their practices were to get water that was

382
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,160
from an underground aquifer. It was not surface water yet. Right. Right. So you just have to

383
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,680
discover what their practices are, just like, you know, when you like I'm buying plastics now.

384
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,420
Right. And it's very interesting when you look at I want to know where your plastics come from.

385
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,640
It says we do not use recycled products. Right. OK. But another one like on the bombs is 10 percent

386
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,820
recycle. All right. And like, oh, big difference. You know, it doesn't. You know, big deal. It is

387
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,040
a big deal. Right. Because you're going to have contaminants that you can't get out, for example.

388
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,500
Right. Like is another tangent, super tangent time. OK. For example, if you have to get

389
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,560
replacement rotors, you know, disc brakes for your car. Right. OK. You go to the auto parts store and

390
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,360
they offer you various tiers, you know, the cheapest one all the way up to the lifetime

391
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,240
warranty one. Get the cheapest, cheapest, cheapest one. Why? Why? And they'll last longer. Why?

392
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,820
Unless you get the top tier ones. Then there's carbon fiber. Yeah. Why do you get the cheapest,

393
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,840
cheapest, cheapest ones? Like they're eight bucks. I remember the average rotors for the

394
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,120
van that I'm using was like 30 bucks. So they had one for like eleven dollars. And I want that one.

395
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,120
You know, it's junk. I'm like, no, it's not. And I told I explained to the guy why he was amazed.

396
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,820
And this is why. Because the cheapest, cheapest rotors come from the cheapest

397
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,520
manufacturing in, quote unquote, China, where they have very little refining on recycled metals.

398
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,260
They're not going to use virgin iron. They're going to just throw everything, you know, old

399
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,260
guardrails, anything you can imagine that the magnet sticks to and melt it, barely refine it.

400
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,900
So you have this incredible variety of metals and alloy that the craziest metallurgist would never

401
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,860
come up with made in these like dirt floor foundries. You're going to have a brake rotor

402
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,200
that's going to have such an exotic mix of metals in it that it's like nothing natural will wear it

403
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,460
out. You know what I mean? So in some cases, having a dirty mixture or a dirty production

404
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,580
process can benefit you. Right. Because of the diversity. It actually was always the diversity

405
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,900
in an alloy usually makes it stronger. That's right. If you do the right thing. Yeah. But it

406
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,620
just so happens that they are doing the right thing and they should flip them. I said these

407
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,660
brake rotors never wear out. You should sell them as you know, I'd buy them and repackage them as

408
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,180
they'll never wear out for a hundred bucks. Anyway, I just want that was a contrast to the water.

409
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,520
Right. You see, the one has a crappy source and it works better. One has a right. Less crappy,

410
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:36,760
you know, less crappy and then getting to a source, which is which is not going to produce what you.

411
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,220
Yeah. But let's get into the why of that, though, because here's the why of it.

412
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,400
Water is elemental. It's one of those things that is essential across the board. It's

413
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,120
it's a component of something as opposed to a combination mixture. Right. Without going into

414
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,560
elemental. Hold on. See, they were managing the water. They were managing the water. They said,

415
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,240
well, we are scientifically advanced and we have stringent processes to distill any water to make

416
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,960
it pure water. And I'm telling you, from a leadership perspective, no, you can't do that

417
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,300
because the water, no matter what you do to it, it'll be very angry. By the way, water likes to

418
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,180
absorb things. Even if you have pure water and you left it in a room, you want that to get it

419
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,100
wants to dissolve gases into it. Right. And some of the container, no matter what it is.

420
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,760
So what I'm saying from a set of a management perspective was we have a stringent process.

421
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,180
We could prove it's distilled. And I'm saying, no, no matter how stringent your process is,

422
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,000
you can't fool water. Water will still remember where it came from. So what this was also an

423
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,120
example of leadership, which is let's try this versus management. The management did not work.

424
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,360
They had failures. Now, the leadership came from out of nowhere. No proof. I had no proof of what

425
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:52,440
I was saying at all. Nothing was tried and it worked. But I knew it would work. Right. Because

426
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,480
I gave the method the reason why, even though it wasn't proven. So that's where leadership comes in.
