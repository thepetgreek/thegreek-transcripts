1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,740
Rated Y Sonic Event 92, and here we are. And it is yet another one of these events.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,540
Greek, how you doing tonight?

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,420
Doing okay. You know, I got a pretty lengthy email, various sundry questions.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,080
I skimmed the email, and I want to read through and answer it because it covers many, many topics.

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,660
And it's even prefaced that some of these might be a dummy load, or let's just start here.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,440
Hey, Greek, here's a rough list of topics, questions for Sonics.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,020
Of course, feel free to go into what you'd like, all, some, or none.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm aware some of this could be dummy loads. It would help to clear it up if possible.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,120
Quite an interesting start, right?

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,080
It's been, yeah, and you know what, it's been quite a long time since you were using that term, dummy load.

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,460
That was like a constant from you when we first started doing this, pretty much.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,720
So, yeah, but I haven't heard of it.

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,860
Yeah, well, that was back when I was more militant.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,220
Now it's, my give-or-should factor is going lower every year.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,960
You know what I mean by give-or-should factor, right?

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,760
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,860
So the more you care, the more upset you get sound, or the more heated and the more passionate.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,840
When you don't care, it's like, ah, so what?

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,900
Well, what's funny is the audience has changed since then a bit, too,

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,160
because I don't know if it's their give-or-should factor that's changed or not,

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,580
but the reality is a lot of people, when they heard that term, they didn't like it.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,340
They thought you were calling them dummies, and meanwhile, take two breaths,

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,920
and you would be saying that most people were effectively space eaters anyway, which...

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, but if you hear the word dummy load and you think you're being called a dummy, guess what?

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,340
You are.

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,200
Yeah, well...

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,140
So go away. Watch Fox News, right?

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,900
Okay, yeah.

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,640
Or CNN, whatever.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,840
I don't even know if such a thing exists anymore, but...

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah, they do.

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,480
I heard they do, yeah.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,900
They have to because it's part of the intelligence apparatus.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, and as per usual, if there is an audience, someone will show up to deliver what that audience wants,

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,780
which is precisely that.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,820
Advice first.

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,160
They want to be lied to, yeah.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah, it's a dog chasing its tail, you know.

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,780
Yeah, that too.

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,120
Anyways, so what is it?

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,460
Let's start with what is a dummy load, by the way.

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,860
This person is obviously somebody who has heard you in the past because, like I said, you haven't used that term in a while.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,080
Yeah, I've used dummy loads often.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,620
A dummy load, a simple way to give an analogy for it would be running on a treadmill.

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,520
So you could run on a treadmill and say you ran two miles, right?

46
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,820
On a treadmill.

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,340
Right.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,940
But where did you go?

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,960
On a treadmill.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,380
Nowhere.

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,240
Right?

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,980
Right.

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
So that's basically it.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,140
The dummy load definition, let's just give what anyone else can access to.

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,480
Let's see if it's meaningful, right?

56
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,400
Let's do it that way.

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,520
What is it?

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,540
Why use a dummy load?

59
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,760
Okay.

60
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,060
Dummy load, Wikipedia.

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,460
A dummy load is a device used to simulate an electrical load, usually for testing purposes.

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,780
Right?

63
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,800
It's a simulation.

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,160
A simulated electrical load.

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,600
So a simulated transfer of energy, which means…

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,220
Yeah, like a simulation run around the block would be running a half a mile on a treadmill.

67
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,180
On a treadmill, yeah.

68
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,020
Or riding a stationary bike.

69
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
You didn't go anywhere on a bicycle.

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,440
Yeah, same thing.

71
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,480
That's right.

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,060
That's what's out there.

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,980
So here we go.

74
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,400
First question.

75
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,080
These are bullet points.

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,880
Psychedelics.

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
Very high usage throughout history.

78
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,920
In almost every culture.

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,820
Secret societies.

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,680
Do you have any opinions?

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,140
Experience.

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,700
Knowledge.

83
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,560
Including states.

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,120
Attained through other means.

85
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,520
Dancing.

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,580
Sensory deprivation.

87
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,080
NDE.

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,760
Meditation.

89
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:39,940
All right.

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,780
First half, yes.

91
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,060
I do have experience with it.

92
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,280
I don't feel like I ever had anyone coach me through it, so it was pretty much like,

93
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,820
I think, 75% of the people that have experience with psychedelics are not coached.

94
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,040
Right?

95
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,740
I'd say maybe 20% or 25% or less do it on a ceremonial basis.

96
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,180
Right?

97
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,980
Well, it has changed a lot in recent years because people have decided to access information,

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
and there's a lot of books on it and videos on it and stuff like that, which means they're

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,840
kind of getting a secondary coaching.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,700
That didn't used to be the case, like say, again, when you were a kid or I was a kid

101
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,900
and we probably first ran into this stuff, and it was about, let's see what else we can

102
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,320
do today.

103
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,340
But the reason I brought that up is because in a secret society situation, for example,

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
you're prepped and you're coached.

105
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,360
Right?

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,180
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,580
Absolutely.

108
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,760
Yeah.

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,120
So what's it for?

110
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,700
I think it's just part of adjusting the perception, but also it does trigger things that are there

111
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,440
that normally wouldn't be triggered.

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,800
Right?

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,740
You don't need any of that at all, but for the average person, I would definitely recommend

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,000
it.

115
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,320
But for someone who's well-versed, seeking knowledge and wisdom or wisdom and knowledge,

116
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,840
hopefully, seek wisdom and then knowledge.

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,780
Because knowledge is kind of hard to attain.

118
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,980
It's just knowledge would be the independent files, and wisdom is what to do with those

119
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,180
files.

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,500
So get the wisdom before you get as much knowledge as you can.

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,660
Because wisdom lets you know how to manage and use it.

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,140
Right.

123
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,080
But sadly, no matter how much knowledge you give to someone, wisdom still remains unattainable

124
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,500
to some.

125
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,740
Right.

126
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,220
And that's how it's made to be.

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah.

128
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,840
I think there's a selection process, not as a terminal thing where someone is selected

129
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,380
and an outcome, but just like a film, you have the main characters, secondary characters,

130
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,940
then you have the backfill people.

131
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,100
What do you call them?

132
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,760
The whatever, the standby people or the backfill.

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,860
In a movie, the extras.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,320
The extras.

135
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,740
Yeah.

136
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,680
Yeah, the extras.

137
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:46,960
Yeah.

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,980
So that's, I think, part of the manifestation here.

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,020
It's what it appears to be throughout history as well.

140
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,400
But do you...

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,920
Well, you know, you make a lot of references to movies as if this whole thing is like a

142
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
big, giant movie.

143
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Sure.

144
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,360
Well, it's not a movie.

145
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,260
It's an analogy, just like the treadmill is an analogy.

146
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,680
Well, right.

147
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,220
But in the analogy...

148
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,640
They both exist, but you can crisscross them.

149
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,200
Right.

150
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
But here...

151
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,480
Okay.

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Go ahead.

153
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,240
Let's just give an example to a book, the Carlos Castaneda books, right?

154
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,240
Ultimately, well, it starts out about how to use the psychedelics in the way the Toltecs

155
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,220
did, but he says you don't need them.

156
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,140
You really don't need them, right?

157
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,580
So there's no need for them, but they're available, right?

158
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:43,100
So I would say that scratch it from a wellness point of view, but if you're in like, ah,

159
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,460
fuck it.

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,380
Let's try it.

161
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,520
It's fine.

162
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,260
As long as you don't have a very bad trip.

163
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,520
It depends on how strong the psychedelic is.

164
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,860
So I'm not for it, but I'm not against it.

165
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,660
But I'm more against it if you want to maintain perfect wellness or not perfect.

166
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Perfect is not...

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,560
Perfect is a terrible thing to try to put on anyone, right?

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,480
It's just good enough and better than good enough.

169
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,940
But yeah, I've done them.

170
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,400
I knew what they were, but I didn't know what it would be like.

171
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,100
So I kind of figured it out as I went.

172
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,480
If I had to do it over again, would I do them?

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,180
Yeah, absolutely.

174
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,060
Because the memories that you have from that are very distinct from anything else.

175
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,940
This is all true.

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,400
I would say, though, that just on a personal level, they were extremely helpful to me.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,940
At a certain point, it gave me greater power to reorganize myself.

178
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,160
Yeah, and you could still access that state of mind,

179
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,580
which you would never be able to have if you never did it in the first place.

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,300
It takes much longer to do it without it.

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,700
But again, you need someone.

182
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,880
You're not going to figure this out on your own unless you happen to be someone who does.

183
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,560
It's very rare.

184
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,900
But yeah, you can get into altered states.

185
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,780
How many times have you heard people...

186
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,160
Someone tells someone, in part, a new idea or a concept,

187
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,120
and what does the person say?

188
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,180
That's really trippy, man.

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
That's like an acid trip.

190
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,700
Or, let's say Chuck and I went to this place,

191
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,580
and it was like being in an acid trip, right?

192
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
So yeah, why would you say that if it wasn't?

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,320
And were you tripping on acid?

194
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,080
No.

195
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
But it was just like one?

196
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,420
Yes, pretty close.

197
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,520
But it also shows you how you can't trust...

198
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,320
No matter how much you want to trust your senses, you can't.

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,080
Right?

200
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,299
Unless the senses, the things that you sensed under, let's say, an LSD trip were real,

201
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:34,360
and now the senses, again, can't be trusted.

202
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,159
Right?

203
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,720
Because you perceive things in a different way.

204
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,580
All right, so the next one.

205
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Animal-human bond.

206
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
What is the significance?

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
Do they raise our life force energy?

208
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,700
Yeah, anything can raise your life force energy.

209
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,300
I think, just a segue here,

210
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,920
most people that practice acupuncture don't know why they're doing it.

211
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,860
It's just a tradition.

212
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,200
The life force energy is also around the body.

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,820
So what the needles represent is a lightning rod.

214
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,420
So the body can be adjusted by borrowing energy that is in its field around it,

215
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,260
in its atmosphere, and driving it, sending it back down to the body, or vice versa.

216
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,460
Right?

217
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,320
If you can send the excess energy into the body, into the atmospheric shell,

218
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,260
without discharging it, shorting it out, to help the body,

219
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,500
you do that as well.

220
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,460
So it works both ways.

221
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,880
I have to harp on them because most of them don't know why they're doing it,

222
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,180
don't know what the purpose is.

223
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
It's just basically a lightning rod.

224
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,340
So when you say life force energy, it could be that mechanical.

225
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,400
When you get to the bonding of humans and animals,

226
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,220
I can't really consider that much more,

227
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,560
other than I know cats are some kind of alien species sent here to monitor us.

228
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:52,660
Right?

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,280
Yeah.

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,560
I mean that, by the way.

231
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,380
That's not a joke.

232
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Yeah.

233
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm more partial to dogs myself.

234
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:02,980
Yeah.

235
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,520
Well, dogs are actually, you know, there's no parentage for dogs and cats.

236
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,620
In other words, they did not evolve from wolves or tigers.

237
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,460
They're independent.

238
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,580
They're just as unique as anything else.

239
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,580
Right?

240
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,220
So, yeah.

241
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,340
But dogs are dogs and cats are cats.

242
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,680
Yeah.

243
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,080
Okay.

244
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,780
What is fire?

245
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,860
I don't believe you've talked too much about it,

246
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,460
but considering how much water is discussed in terms of sacrifice,

247
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,400
what is the significance or importance of fire?

248
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,640
Okay.

249
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,240
Leave the sacrifice part out, because that's a big term, really,

250
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,940
and it's very subjective.

251
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,040
But fire is – here's the thing.

252
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,960
I have mentioned this.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've done a lot of speaking with Seth on Revolution Radio back in the days.

254
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,540
It was called – what's the – Isaac Asimov Foundation.

255
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,100
Yeah.

256
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,120
Back in the 2009, 2010, and 11.

257
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,460
Spent four or five hours on the weekends there speaking on the radio.

258
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,180
And I did get into what fire was more on itself,

259
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,000
because at the time I was doing alchemic stuff.

260
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,720
The other day I found some heavy copper strips that are wrapped up real tight,

261
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,460
and I haven't opened them, but I was like, this is not labeled.

262
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,100
What is it?

263
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,560
Ah, this is when we're transmuting,

264
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,360
we're turning basic oxidized minerals into gold on a copper strip,

265
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,900
on a copper, let's say, plate.

266
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,640
That's what they are.

267
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,460
One day I'll open them up and photograph it doing alchemy.

268
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,040
So fire is very important, right, when you're going to reduce that.

269
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,000
So in essence from a chemical point of view, what is fire?

270
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,600
It's oxidation.

271
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,840
That's all it is.

272
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Think about it.

273
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,360
How do you stop a fire?

274
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,300
Deprive it of what?

275
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,920
Oxygen, right?

276
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,760
Typical fires we're talking about, right?

277
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,960
Yeah, but it seems like you're explaining the chemical aspect of it.

278
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,120
Right.

279
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,880
That's the chemical.

280
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,580
What is fire?

281
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah.

282
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
That's basically what – all it is is oxidation.

283
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,520
For example, hydrogen peroxide is a very strong oxidizer

284
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,420
when you get it above 20%.

285
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,880
Thirty-three percent hydrogen peroxide is basically rocket fuel.

286
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,240
They use them – when a C-130 is too heavy for takeoff,

287
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,500
they have these six-inch cylinders they attach to them,

288
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,660
and they fire them off to help the plane take off when it does an airdrop.

289
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,480
Okay, if you put that strong hydrogen peroxide on a piece of paper towel,

290
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,020
what happens?

291
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,140
It starts to smoke and what?

292
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,840
Catch fire.

293
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,400
Any strong oxidizer concentrated will start a fire.

294
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,180
So fire is basically oxidation.

295
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,500
Now there are other fires that can happen like sodium in water, right?

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
If you take pure sodium strips – this is the pure chemical stuff.

297
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,640
That's what it is.

298
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,600
In terms of when you say fire, there are fires that don't burn hot.

299
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,080
It's in the biblical text.

300
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,040
By the way, you hear a lot, especially Jason Warwick,

301
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,820
so funny that he talks about Yahweh and the burning bush and all that.

302
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,960
You know there's no burning bush in the Bible, by the way?

303
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,420
Here, let me harp on our cakes a little bit.

304
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,680
He says he's read the Bible 40 times and he has the notes to prove it.

305
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,140
Okay.

306
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,180
I don't think – he read it once 40 times because if he did that,

307
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,680
you would have seen that the bush is never burning.

308
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,260
It was an angel that was emitting fire, scared Moses,

309
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,260
so the angel decided – because he had to deliver the message,

310
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,380
how are you going to do it if Moses is going to run away, right?

311
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,660
So he stood behind a bush, so the bush was between him and Moses,

312
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,940
and his fire did not consume the bush.

313
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
So where's the burning bush?

314
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,500
So if you've read it at least once with comprehension is all it takes.

315
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,080
But anyway, there's that type of fire as well.

316
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,780
I have witnessed fire that doesn't burn.

317
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,960
Anyone can if you work with a very high-quality HHO torch.

318
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,780
They're called HHO torches.

319
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
It's an intelligent fire.

320
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,360
It will burn through fire brick.

321
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,560
It will burn through four inches of steel.

322
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,100
But you put it on your hand, it barely singes the hairs on your hand or your body.

323
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,860
When you put it on a live plant, it doesn't hurt the live plant.

324
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,140
If you put it on the brick, it will cut right through the brick immediately.

325
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,260
Interesting, right?

326
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,620
Very intelligent, right?

327
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,040
It doesn't hurt things with life.

328
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,940
But essentially it's an – most fire is an oxidizer

329
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,380
unless you start going into the intelligent fires,

330
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,420
which is the HHO or angels that seem to be emitting flames that don't burn bushes.

331
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Okay, so that's all I could get into with that.

332
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,280
And I'll unwrap – well, I don't know.

333
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
It's kind of like the Scalarator thing.

334
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,300
Sometimes when I show things that I do, I don't really want to post them

335
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,480
because it's kind of look what I could do, look what I could do, right?

336
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,840
I don't like doing that kind of stuff.

337
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,980
But I found out that when I do do that, it inspires certain people.

338
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
So in a sense, it's good, right?

339
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,500
Right.

340
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,420
Yeah.

341
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,820
Can you speak about the Nazis?

342
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,720
Oh, the Nazis.

343
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,420
That's the National Socialist Party.

344
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,580
Nazi is a derogative term, by the way.

345
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,340
There was some New York Times writer that made that up, right?

346
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,240
It's like calling Asian people gooks, right, or nips.

347
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,260
But it's totally acceptable, right?

348
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,780
In academia, they use that term.

349
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,580
So can you speak about the National Socialist Party and what's actually going on?

350
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,300
Not just the Holocaust, but more importantly, their search around the world

351
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,340
of whatever they're looking for, knowledge of Aryans, life force, energy engines,

352
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,740
inter-Earth groups, interdimensional communication, Tibet's 20 years with monks.

353
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,680
Not 20 years, but yeah, I'd say so.

354
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,260
It started in the 20s, so yeah, you could probably say 20 years.

355
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,740
Aryans, okay.

356
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,720
Do you know anything about this?

357
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,020
Yes.

358
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,000
You go online and there's about the Germans visiting Tibet,

359
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
and there's a sketch of it from a book that's been redacted,

360
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,680
which was online in the early 2000s, not anymore.

361
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,480
All there is online right now is how the Tibetans lifted heavy stones

362
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,620
up of a cliff face using drums and trumpets, right?

363
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,260
And that was a sketch from a book from one of these Germans

364
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,620
that had gone there and spoke to them.

365
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,180
What was redacted, not shown on the Internet anymore,

366
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,220
is when the Germans asked through a translator, the Tibetans,

367
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,980
about their history.

368
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,560
They went into some satchels and came out,

369
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,460
and they had these things that looked like glass pads,

370
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,060
and they would pass their hand over it,

371
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,300
and it would give the entire video and audio history, right?

372
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,560
This is in the 1920s.

373
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,740
I don't even think we have iPads and tablets, but they're not like that.

374
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,320
It's not like a clear piece of glass that you wave your hand over, right?

375
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,040
The Germans ended up around a lot of wild stuff.

376
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,000
They had basically Skype in Germany.

377
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,360
Guess when?

378
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,460
Around that same time period.

379
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,140
Perhaps, yeah.

380
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,600
Where you had video conferencing.

381
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,180
I've never heard of that.

382
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,680
Yeah, no.

383
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

384
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,700
Video conferencing, yes.

385
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,360
That's right, and they even had advertisements about that.

386
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,340
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,400
Small tube, yeah, and you would, yeah.

388
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah, and you could literally make these calls like you do on Skype,

389
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,080
see somebody on the screen, they see you, the whole thing,

390
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,180
and people act like, oh, that just came out in 2010 or whatever.

391
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,980
It's like, no, you know, or 2001,

392
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,079
or whenever it is they first decided to tell people it existed.

393
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,780
But it existed before that.

394
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,660
There's a crazy question about that, by the way, about Nazis.

395
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:21,440
I found that to be very similar to the Hebrew title

396
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,160
they give to the president of Israel.

397
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,660
The Nazi.

398
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,140
Yeah.

399
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,579
It's like it's.

400
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah, the Nassim, like Nassim or Nazi, yeah, that's a Semitic term.

401
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,560
Yeah, and it's a N-A-S-S-I.

402
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, that's the Jordan Maxwell stuff.

403
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,860
Yeah, no, but I'm just saying it's very weird to me that that is.

404
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,300
Like the sun in the sky is the son of God, it's not.

405
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,780
But, yeah, I don't stretch things that far, but I get you.

406
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,460
I get you.

407
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,040
I try to stick more to the etymology.

408
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,560
Nazi is a derogatory term.

409
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,820
It should be National Socialist Party, but I get it.

410
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,060
Okay, the Aryans.

411
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,360
The Aryans, you know, Iran formally changed before the Shah or,

412
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,540
yeah, before the Shah, it was called, they switched it to Iran

413
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,520
because they were professed to being the legal descendants

414
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,440
of the original Aryans, the original humans, let's say, right,

415
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,980
of certain types, hybrids.

416
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,300
If you want to get more into that, you can listen to Archaics on the Anu.

417
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,440
And you do mean before the first Shah.

418
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,640
Shah, by the way, is a term just meaning king.

419
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,660
But Shah.

420
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,620
Before the Shah, that was put in the 50s.

421
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,920
So around the 1920s or 30s, they changed it from Persia to Iran

422
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,840
because they were legally Aryans.

423
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,140
Yeah, because the one that was installed in the 50s there

424
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,300
when they got rid of Mosaddegh, that was the son of the original Shah,

425
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,880
which was installed before that.

426
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,100
Yeah.

427
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,780
Right.

428
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,900
Yeah, the one that was, because remember, the Iranians, Persians,

429
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
are not Arabs.

430
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,840
They're not Arabs, right?

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,120
Right.

432
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,660
So they're much closer to the Afghani people.

433
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
They're Farsi, right?

434
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,380
So, yeah, I would say with the Aryans and all that,

435
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,080
there was a lot of exemptions.

436
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
They worked, again, with the Germans and all that.

437
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,160
So is there significance to that?

438
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,120
It goes back, again, Archaics has a lot of stuff on that,

439
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,280
on the Anunna and how the people that came after the main cataclysms

440
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,520
and mixed with men, you know, that were on the surface,

441
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,540
the primitive people.

442
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,100
I think the stuff that he's dug into really deeply on that,

443
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,100
it's undeniable.

444
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,440
You could go look at something he's got called the Anunna files.

445
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,840
It's about five or six hours of stuff he gives you.

446
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,180
He just likes to, just like I did for a long time, and still do,

447
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,560
you've got to get some source material, right,

448
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,680
if you're going to bring something as history.

449
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
Then you have personal experiences,

450
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,140
and then you have social experiences and comments and all that.

451
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,180
But essentially, if you're going to get information on history,

452
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,220
it would be good to cite some kind of source, and he's done that.

453
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,980
So the Aryans, again, all we have, we're hybrids, right, from that.

454
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,300
Okay, life force energy, the more research I do,

455
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
it seems that it was some of the most important knowledge

456
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,320
held by most secret societies.

457
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,100
By the way, most secret societies that you know of,

458
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,380
let's say Masons, those are all buffer zones.

459
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,480
Those are all intermediaries.

460
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
They really don't know much.

461
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,080
If you know any Freemasons,

462
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,960
99% of them are joining it because of business opportunities.

463
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,920
They help out each other.

464
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,640
Yeah, mainly.

465
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,020
And the parties.

466
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,640
Networking, basically.

467
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,320
Networking, yeah, they don't know anything.

468
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,860
What's funny about that, though,

469
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,260
is that there are various sort of suborganizations

470
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,640
which they confuse the histories of and all that,

471
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
like, say, the Knights Templar,

472
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,220
who are pretty much almost like a subset of the Masons at this point,

473
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,520
and all these things, and you can chase it around,

474
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,080
like, again, a dog chasing its tail.

475
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,620
Yeah, but again, it's not put out to them.

476
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
Right, right.

477
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,120
They're like, what do you call it when you set up a group to attract attention

478
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,120
so the real stuff is not, you know, no one looks at the real stuff.

479
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,860
They look at where you, I don't know, like a decoy.

480
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,700
They're decoys.

481
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,540
They often talk about common usage is like false flags, right?

482
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,800
So it's almost like the existing secret societies,

483
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,600
the guys with the big old, you know, lodges and all that.

484
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,040
They're decoys, yeah.

485
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,580
They're the decoys.

486
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,660
I think by the time of the Golden Dawn, you know, the 1890s,

487
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,300
that was the – let me just rephrase that.

488
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,640
Prior to the 1890s, the chances of getting real stuff

489
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,060
and having real, you know, within the surface of that building,

490
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,840
it was probably more like it.

491
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,080
After the 1890s, for sure, it's all just a decoy, for sure.

492
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,540
You can get more.

493
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,340
I've run into people that have been studying it,

494
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,820
and they thought I was in those secret societies

495
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,060
because of the stuff I was talking about.

496
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,760
I was like, no, no, it's just out there right now.

497
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,540
It's just – all right.

498
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,440
So, okay.

499
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,440
And it gets a little bit more into the Kundalini transmutation,

500
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,480
all this other stuff.

501
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,180
That stuff is another decoy, another distraction.

502
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,760
All that tantric stuff, transmutation, okay.

503
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,620
All that stuff, that energy stuff, if you study its roots,

504
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,460
it's all emo work, all of it.

505
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
All of it is emo work, including yoga.

506
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,840
When you say yoga to a westerner,

507
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,460
they think it's bending your body in uncomfortable positions, right,

508
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,100
where a real yoga master would say don't do it if it's uncomfortable.

509
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,740
Yoga is only 10% exercise and physical stretching, right?

510
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
90% of it is state of mind, right?

511
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,380
It's emo, believe it or not.

512
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,620
So we've gone through the emo and the importance of that.

513
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,220
From private messages and emails,

514
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,520
there are still quite a few people working on the emo with success, by the way.

515
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,080
It's been a couple of years, and, yes, it does take that long, right?

516
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,920
But they're glad that they're doing it.

517
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,280
It's much like martial arts.

518
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,400
The majority of that is not about the stances you take

519
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
or the defense postures and all this kind of stuff.

520
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,500
Yes, indeed, those things can be useful,

521
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,840
but the truth is that the majority of it is internal and it's about control.

522
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah, a short way to say that is the martial arts that are taught,

523
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,560
especially to westerners, to put your key, your life energy, outside of yourself.

524
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,000
Right.

525
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,660
Where the higher schools are to keep all of the energy inside of you,

526
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,100
not in a detrimental way, but to contain it and use it from within

527
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,980
and also use the energy of others.

528
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,500
Yeah, so if you want to, by the way,

529
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,660
even the highest form would be Qigong, Tai Chi, right?

530
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,440
Qigong, Qigong.

531
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,840
But even that has been, you're not going to get.

532
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,000
That's emo work again.

533
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,340
That's emo work, you know.

534
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,420
Yeah.

535
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,640
Okay, what does fear do to the energy?

536
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,360
Okay, well, it seems to be important in sacrifice ritual society, hungry entities.

537
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:02,060
Yeah, fear is a very simple way to think of fear is two ways.

538
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,660
One is, okay, the way that most people use it is to disable you, right?

539
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,040
It's disabling.

540
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
What does that mean?

541
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,680
Okay, just that, it's disabling.

542
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,580
Yeah, no, it disables and disrupts.

543
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,760
If you think about that, just no matter what the circumstances,

544
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,900
when you're in fear, you're not able to make as clear a decision.

545
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,860
You're not able to function as well.

546
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,720
It's just that simple.

547
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,860
And then there's another one, another type of fear, which is not discussed,

548
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,660
which is in the higher spiritual circles.

549
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,860
And I've brought it up, but I've not discussed it.

550
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,140
And I won't discuss it here much, but I'll bring it up again.

551
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,740
When something is of so much utmost significance to you,

552
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,600
it's a fear energy that there is no option but to proceed.

553
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,200
So, in other words, the disabling fear that makes someone a coward

554
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,220
that cries in the foxhole, that same energy, just slightly focused

555
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,980
in a different way, like low pressure water versus high pressure water,

556
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,080
in a high pressure fear, that's the one that drives the guy

557
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,820
on the front line to run into a stream of bullets, right?

558
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,260
You see?

559
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,620
The bravest guy in the army is driven by fear.

560
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,980
And the weakest guy, the yellow belly, the guy that gets shot

561
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,260
for whatever is also fear.

562
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,240
One aspect of fear, like two sides of a coin,

563
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,440
heads or tails are black and white, one is very yin, one is very yang.

564
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,120
The disabling one makes you very yin, scattered.

565
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,940
And the inspirational one, I'll give you an example of the other fear.

566
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,760
Soccer mom, minivan full of children, coming back from a soccer game

567
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,120
or softball game is actually more popular, right?

568
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
And she loves her children, she's having a conversation,

569
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,740
car accident, car flips, minivan flips, 90 pound, 110, 120 pound,

570
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,140
5'3", mom gets out and she flips the van back up that, you know,

571
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,620
two or three power lifters would have a hard time doing.

572
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,320
What made her do that is fear of harm coming to those children.

573
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,420
You see?

574
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,440
So when fear is blanketly used one way, whenever you're just shown one thing,

575
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,720
like, you know, in politics they do that.

576
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,140
This guy's bad, this guy's good, well, you're on this side, right?

577
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,960
That's why, no, it's never one, right?

578
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,540
It's the same thing, right?

579
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,920
It's the same thing no matter who it's politics.

580
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,620
Fear is kind of political.

581
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,660
You can go one way or another, right?

582
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,940
So one group might want to instill the disabling fear on another group,

583
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,580
but the other fear is more individual,

584
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,460
the one that focuses and brings inspiration and you have no option.

585
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,440
These 100 pound soccer mom that had to turn the minivan over on her own

586
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,880
to save the children did it out of fear of what?

587
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,900
Fear of harm coming to those children.

588
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:52,880
You see?

589
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,420
So that's never discussed.

590
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,220
Yeah, even if you take a look at the run speed on somebody, you know,

591
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,640
when they're truly focused by their fear,

592
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,740
they can run at a much faster rate than they ever could in any other circumstance.

593
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,860
It would be the fight or flight.

594
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,140
The fight or flight is that fear we're talking about now.

595
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,480
So if you stay and fight, it's not because you're cowardly.

596
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,180
And if you run faster, it's not because you're cowardly either.

597
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,300
I mean Bruce Lee said run from a fight first if you can run, right,

598
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,060
instead of fighting.

599
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,100
Fighting is the last option.

600
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,140
But, okay, so that's about the fear energy.

601
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,480
It's a duality there.

602
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,780
And one is bad, one is good, yes, depending, right?

603
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,140
So and that ties in with the animals also, right?

604
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,380
It's a very primordial, very deep because dogs could sense fear.

605
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,640
I'll give the analogy.

606
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,860
One person is a dog lover.

607
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,260
The other person is afraid of dogs.

608
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,760
They both walk up to a junkyard dog by a fence.

609
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
Neither of them say anything.

610
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,300
Who is the junkyard dog going to start barking at?

611
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,180
The one who is afraid of dogs, even though they haven't exhibited any fear, right?

612
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,860
They can read that in your aura, let's say, in your being.

613
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,940
Okay.

614
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,660
Any information you're willing to share about underground people?

615
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,260
That would be more on the archaic side and Donald Marshall's side.

616
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,400
Donald Marshall talks about the Saurians.

617
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,680
The Saurians were an old race, a reptilian race, upright.

618
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,380
They speak and all that.

619
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,860
And the underground people.

620
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,400
Underground is something that everyone always goes to.

621
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,280
And given the analogy that, you know, I built a new house.

622
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,060
And I'm having new furniture for the new house.

623
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,780
Makes sense, right?

624
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,300
Furniture company delivers the furniture.

625
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,740
Do I tell them to put all the furniture, bedroom, living room, kitchen on the roof?

626
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,380
Or do I tell them to put the furniture inside each corresponding room inside the house?

627
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,500
And if I lived on the roof like that, all the neighbors would be saying, what an idiot.

628
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,360
What's wrong with him?

629
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,560
Right?

630
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,120
Something wrong.

631
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,320
So if you see, whenever you see people living on the surface, they're subject to weather events, cosmic events, right?

632
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,420
All this other stuff.

633
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,040
An advanced society, all advanced societies live underground inside the dwelling.

634
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,300
The earth is the dwelling, right?

635
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,200
That's all I can say about the underground people.

636
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,480
Far more advanced.

637
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,060
Way more advanced, right?

638
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,840
I mean, put it this way.

639
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,600
Let's say you do find a neighborhood, one of these ticky-tacky neighborhoods, suburbia or whatever.

640
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm not talking about Appalachian crazy people, but suburban neighborhood.

641
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,120
You drive down the street.

642
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,080
Everyone's in their houses.

643
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
Let's say it's dusk.

644
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,380
You could look inside their homes.

645
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,380
They have their blinds drawn.

646
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,180
They're having dinner, watching TV in the living room.

647
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,220
You could see inside, right?

648
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,440
And here you come upon a house with all this furniture and all this stuff and tarps, and they're living on the roof.

649
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,260
And the house is all boarded up down below.

650
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,340
Wow!

651
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,260
What's wrong with that picture?

652
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,380
Right?

653
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,500
You see?

654
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,740
That's basically the point that I'm trying to make.

655
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,160
We should have taken advantage of it.

656
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,300
It has been taken advantage of.

657
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,900
And I think if you try to go down there, you're going to get in big trouble.

658
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,380
You're not allowed because you're one of the surface dummies.

659
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:19,840
There were laws passed, I think, federal laws, that if you go more than, what, eight feet underground, you know, without – or if you find a cave, you can't go more than ten feet inside of it.

660
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,780
Otherwise, it's like ten years in prison, right?

661
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,320
Something like that.

662
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,400
They made it very serious now.

663
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,660
They really don't want any mingling.

664
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,020
What role do these underground societies are playing with the world today?

665
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,740
Well, those are the ones running the surface.

666
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Very simple, right?

667
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,800
Are they working with surface groups to keep things hidden?

668
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,300
Absolutely.

669
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,260
For benevolent or malevolent reasons?

670
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,720
Both.

671
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,980
Are they physical beings in that or perceivable world?

672
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,520
Both.

673
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,000
Both.

674
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,280
Yeah.

675
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,300
Because you can go into certain parts underground.

676
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,200
It's provable that the densities are so high that you cannot have any physicality.

677
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,120
Okay.

678
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:05,760
So I found most myths, stories, and symbols in all religions, and even Disney ironically, are actually stories that are at least tens of thousands – at least thousands of years old.

679
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,940
Not tens, just thousands of years old.

680
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,000
Everything is just retold in different ways, but it's clearly all the same.

681
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,360
Yes.

682
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,080
Whose stories are they?

683
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,980
Well, again, you just tie it into the people.

684
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,160
It's what we're permitted to, right?

685
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,960
We live in a society where information and what people talk about is permissible or non-permissible, right?

686
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,240
Hey, I'd like to add into something here a question because nobody ever answers this one for me.

687
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,500
There are parts of the ocean that we've never seen, depths that we're not able to get to.

688
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,460
Yeah.

689
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,700
Well, they have been seen and they're very well known, but they're not discussed again.

690
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:49,420
Well, the general public does not know and we're told if you go down too far, we're just crushed and we can't get any further down, right?

691
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,440
That's what we're told.

692
00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:01,380
But one would think that would be an even better place to conceal things than …

693
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,660
For temporary.

694
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,200
Yeah.

695
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Because oceans change very quickly.

696
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,120
That's been scrubbed from our history.

697
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,080
Archaics, again, will give you a lot of that.

698
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,180
In the future, even in the biblical in Isaiah, we won't have – the earth will no longer have oceans.

699
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,600
It will have seas and lakes and rivers, but not oceans.

700
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,600
OK.

701
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,540
Yeah.

702
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:25,280
In other words, we won't be 70 percent water on the surface or 80 percent.

703
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,420
It will be the other way around.

704
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:33,280
It will be 30 percent water and trillions and hundreds of billions of people could live here easily.

705
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:41,500
I mean right now, I think everyone on the planet, if there are – I don't believe that there are seven or eight billion people because the bankers are keeping those records, right?

706
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,940
Those are World Bank numbers.

707
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,700
Right, right.

708
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,020
And bankers keep double books and they lie and it's in their benefit to have more people that create more commercial paper.

709
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,420
I think it's less than half of that.

710
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,620
I think I gave the analogy.

711
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,560
They say that 80 percent of the people in China have cell phones, but there are only 300 million cell phone accounts.

712
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,780
So if you do the math, there's only six or – right?

713
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,260
700 million or something?

714
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,020
Yeah.

715
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,960
Or less, 600 million, not a billion and a half?

716
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,420
Yeah.

717
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,000
No, the thing is if you've got a billion and a half people in China, then that means you would need a minimum.

718
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,400
One point something billion cell phones and there aren't that many.

719
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,560
Right.

720
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,460
So the cell phone records audit, oops, that got out, right?

721
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:28,900
Yeah.

722
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,140
So there's not that many.

723
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,520
So if you factor that in, there's probably no more than three billion people on the max, right?

724
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,820
But even at the seven billion number, everyone could live comfortably, comfortably like in a tight suburban setting.

725
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,820
In Texas, all seven billion people.

726
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:55,920
Anyone that's driven around – I mean I've gone – when I go from here to Tucson to California, there's stretches of I-10 that I go on for an hour and a half and I see nothing, nothing.

727
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:05,820
I mean there's of course service stations, but if you pull over from the service station and decide to get off I-10 and go north or south, there's nothing there for hours.

728
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:06,880
Right.

729
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,780
We're not overpopulated.

730
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,060
Yeah, no, not at all.

731
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:25,840
That's the other funny question because even if you just look at what they call the United States, right, and they tell you how many people are supposed to be here, I don't think it's that many and it seems to me like there's a whole lot of land that's not really being used by people.

732
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:38,100
All of the land is not – like if you could fit everyone in what's called the Texas state, it's very insignificant, especially if you factor in that there are really not that many people as they say, right?

733
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,460
Right.

734
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,960
We don't have any independent consensus of how many people there are, only the banks, right?

735
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,380
And the reason they tell you there's shortages is because they don't know how to handle the monetization, not because there's shortages of water, gold, food or anything, right?

736
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:01,040
I do have a problem with like five billion cattle being slaughtered in America alone or something outrageous like that.

737
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,040
We don't need to do that at all, right?

738
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,240
That many animals – animal factory farming, right?

739
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,660
It doesn't have to be done and all that.

740
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,800
Yeah, there are issues, things that are overdone, right?

741
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,620
And the use of petroleum products as they're being used as fuels.

742
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,640
We should have a hydrogen economy, not a petroleum, right?

743
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,820
And it's been proven that the best lubricants are not petroleum-based.

744
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
They're plant-based, right?

745
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,420
There's – it's Mobile One which is a very good mobile – a motor oil.

746
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:35,700
Right.

747
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,000
And their highest research laboratory is constantly – they don't do it much anymore.

748
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:50,100
From their research labs, when they did publish papers, the oils that lasted the longest with the most heat and the most – less viscosity breakdown were plant-based.

749
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,720
Go figure.

750
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,580
So we don't have – yeah, it's just certain things need to be adjusted and not done as much.

751
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,200
And when you do that, then we're on our way to let's say more than sustainable, right?

752
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,500
So – and start doing commerce without money.

753
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,460
Well, the banker's money that they use.

754
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,080
Go back to where a nickel bought you a steak dinner.

755
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,160
No pun intended.

756
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,140
I just mentioned cows.

757
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,440
Too many cows being slaughtered.

758
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
But you know what I mean, right?

759
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,200
If you look at old movies, it was what?

760
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,520
Five cents, ten cents for dinner?

761
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,660
Steak dinner, right?

762
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,480
Right.

763
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,740
So if you go back to that, so you don't need all that monetization.

764
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,940
Yeah, it's pretty easy to fix the world.

765
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,160
Most attorneys and doctors and whatever will meet their demise.

766
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,600
But before they meet their demise, what you do is you give them an option.

767
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,240
You know how they have those weed killers that are toxic?

768
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,180
You have the doctors and attorneys pull the weeds and they herd goats and sheep.

769
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,400
That's what people used to do before, goat herders and sheep herders.

770
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,160
The farmers would welcome them before planting to pass their herds over the fields to eat all the weeds, right?

771
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,660
Right.

772
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,960
And if you don't have enough sheep or goats, you have attorneys and doctors picking the weeds.

773
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,380
Or, you know, the terminate them with extreme prejudice.

774
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,440
You know what that means, right?

775
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,860
Of course.

776
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,240
Because most of them are responsible for killing people.

777
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,800
At least every doctor is responsible.

778
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:20,040
I would suggest average doctors, if they practiced, you know, 20 years, has killed at least a thousand people directly.

779
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,940
Each one.

780
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,900
So over a 20 year period.

781
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:28,220
So we're talking about Charles Manson being a Cub Scout.

782
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,940
So we're talking about the average practitioner now.

783
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,320
They do it through prescriptions and whatever.

784
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:36,980
Okay.

785
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,140
So that's not opinion, by the way.

786
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,420
So all these adjustments can be made pretty simply.

787
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,460
All right.

788
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,980
So here's one.

789
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,000
Was lead paint in buildings more beneficial than harmful?

790
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,680
No.

791
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,800
Yes and no.

792
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,000
Not necessary.

793
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,540
The original paints were calcimine.

794
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,100
Basically, when you hired someone to paint your home, they showed up with a wagon with all these powders.

795
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:06,940
Right.

796
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,800
And they mixed the paint on site using linseed oil and various other things.

797
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,640
When you call a paint contractor now or you want to paint, you go and you buy these liquid paint.

798
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,860
It wasn't like that back in the day.

799
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,640
We were talking about using big, expensive brushes before we got on.

800
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,200
So the lead paint is a factor of the oil industry again.

801
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:37,900
And the scare about lead paint and children eating them was overdone because when lead is added to paint, it becomes encapsulated.

802
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,840
It's very – you can eat as much lead paint as you want and will not come down in most cases with lead poisoning.

803
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,120
It was done from other things that they've experimented on people.

804
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,700
They had to blame it on something just like they blame lung cancer on cigarette smoking.

805
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,340
When it wasn't, it was actually all the nuclear testing they were doing.

806
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,520
People were breathing the air down.

807
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,360
No one in California got lung cancer unless you were a black woman or a Jewish woman.

808
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,780
Anyways, read the stats on what I mean by that.

809
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,380
So it's encapsulated.

810
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,300
Recently I heard a short part of an interview with Philip K. Dick's wife.

811
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,800
She was talking about her childhood and how they were trying to eradicate polio by giving everyone, the young children, polio vaccines every year.

812
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,740
There's no such thing as polio.

813
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,880
That was from the DDT spraying of flies, nervous damage.

814
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:37,100
But anyway, she said that every year after the polio vaccines, only half the classroom would be alive because they were killing off – right?

815
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:37,700
Right.

816
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,220
Every year they were killing off half the people with these things.

817
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,280
But again, where's the outrage?

818
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,400
So I'm not saying lead paint is good for you, but I'm saying that it was blamed for many other things that were being done.

819
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
In terms of energy, Faraday cage blocking signals radiation.

820
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,620
Yeah, Faraday cages work in most cases.

821
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,580
I have seen where they do not work.

822
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,180
That's another discussion.

823
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,620
That's when you're using a Tesla-based – let's just say with Tesla coils.

824
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,180
I'm not into directing people.

825
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,260
Yes, it's technology that's worth looking into.

826
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:26,960
But if you go on YouTube or whatever, it's everyone making sparks, and that's because they're not adjusted properly.

827
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,480
It's kind of like saying we're working on our cars and all this black smoke is coming out.

828
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,320
That means like something's wrong with your car, right?

829
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,680
So if you're working with Tesla coils and making sparks, there's something wrong with your coil, right?

830
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,320
Okay.

831
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,800
But if you can create a circuit where you generate – it's going to be 1.6 or 1.8 times the speed of light going through the circuit.

832
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,080
The Faraday cage will have a hard time blocking that.

833
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:58,980
That ties into the previous conversation we've had with an alternative Internet powered or carried by ham radio type.

834
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:05,840
But not through the air with ham antennas but through the ground where you'd be propagating through the ground at twice the speed of light.

835
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,680
In terms of what they tell you, the upper limit is just a constant in a vacuum.

836
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,020
All right.

837
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,980
Carl Jung, what do you think of his work, especially his idea of the collective unconscious?

838
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,220
Is he correct?

839
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,840
Dummy loans?

840
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,840
Yeah.

841
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:27,140
Anything that's been put out that the mainstream knows is a dummy loan unless you pick it all apart and pick the corn out of the poop.

842
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,840
I haven't used that in a long time.

843
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:29,900
Yeah.

844
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,080
I don't know much about Carl Jung.

845
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,760
There's something about him that didn't ring right with me.

846
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,200
It's just like Freud.

847
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,240
All I know about him and Freud, for example, is what everyone else knows from reading comic books.

848
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay.

849
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,240
So empathy, what's the significance of – by the way, I have not read this email like I'm reading it now.

850
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,180
I just skimmed over it.

851
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,500
Okay.

852
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,540
So empathy, what's the significance of empaths?

853
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,960
Why do things touch them so deeply?

854
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,680
Well, who's them?

855
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
We all have the ability.

856
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,480
If one person can be empathic, everyone is empathic.

857
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,120
It's just whether or not they've taken control.

858
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,140
It's just like saying I know someone who plays golf.

859
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,980
Well, anybody could play golf, right?

860
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,420
Yeah.

861
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,460
Or try to play it.

862
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,320
It's the same thing.

863
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,700
It's just a skill.

864
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,380
Whether they do it badly or not is another question.

865
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,140
Yeah.

866
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,000
It's just like – well, yeah.

867
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,900
It's just like the – but it's a terrible – you get yelled at.

868
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:33,360
If you go to a golf tournament and your guy let's say does well and you – let's say a small crowd of people start clapping, they'll throw you out of the tournament for doing that, right?

869
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,620
You're supposed to be really quiet.

870
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,940
Talk about a solemn sport.

871
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,060
There's no cheering, right?

872
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,700
Aloud.

873
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:41,680
Okay.

874
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,800
Should there be transforming or control of these energies?

875
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,220
Okay.

876
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,500
It's like emo work again, right?

877
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,720
Sending and receiving.

878
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,360
It's all emo.

879
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,780
We're never told what the purpose of emotions are.

880
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,040
I feel like I only heard part of the question because – what energy?

881
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh, empathy.

882
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,780
What's the significance of empaths?

883
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,320
Why do things touch them so deeply?

884
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,120
Should there be transforming or control of those energies?

885
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,020
Oh, okay, okay.

886
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,340
I didn't –

887
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,020
Yeah, absolutely.

888
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,300
Controlled by first of all realizing that we're all – could it – let's look at it this way.

889
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,640
Could it be possible that we've ignored and left something so unacknowledged that we could now deny its existence?

890
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,280
Yeah.

891
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,120
Yeah, of course.

892
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,580
Pretty much.

893
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,520
That's pretty much what's going on with it.

894
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:30,580
I think maybe though the question there is more about is there a purpose for – okay.

895
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,920
How can that be used?

896
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,580
Let's say – I mean empathy is informative, right?

897
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,280
I mean that's really what it is.

898
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,020
It's how much you're allowing yourself to be informed through the emo.

899
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,880
Yes, of course.

900
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,920
It's the two-way street on the emo.

901
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,420
Yeah.

902
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,120
What are you picking up?

903
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,580
We do it – you know what?

904
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:58,580
You can be – and time and distance doesn't matter by the way with empathy, right?

905
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,680
You don't have to be even near the person.

906
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,340
But we have so much filtered out with that stream of information.

907
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,820
It's a very subtle information.

908
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,020
That's a big subject but it's emo.

909
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,420
Emo.

910
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,280
Learn how to set yourself up for receiving, right?

911
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
You know the thing about giving energy?

912
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,080
I've always given the metaphor.

913
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,680
When you give someone a hug, that's the giving energy.

914
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,620
You feel a rise, right?

915
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,060
Right.

916
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:37,080
So if you want to receive something, that would be whether it's a surprise or not.

917
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,340
Let's say a party where you're given a present or a gift.

918
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,760
There are lots of holidays for that.

919
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,100
When you see someone saying, hey, I got something for you.

920
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,460
They're going and getting let's say the present or the gift.

921
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,780
You know that feeling you have?

922
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,320
It's kind of like the hug but it's in the opposite direction.

923
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,060
You're waiting to accept something, right?

924
00:44:59,520 --> 00:44:59,680
Right.

925
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,800
Do you remember like someone saying – or a very simple way to remember this is if you

926
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,360
receive post where you live, the postman comes to the front of your house, gets out

927
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,920
and starts walking towards the mailbox and you now anticipate going to the mailbox and

928
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,200
getting what he's putting in.

929
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,080
He hasn't put it in there yet.

930
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,200
He's on his way putting it in there.

931
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,680
That feeling right there, that's an empathic feeling.

932
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,180
You're receiving, right?

933
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:26,700
Okay.

934
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,020
So anytime you anticipate receiving something is the emo.

935
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,160
Well, you can – it doesn't have to be that way.

936
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,820
I like giving these examples just to set – so look what is he talking about, right?

937
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,100
Like the dummy load being a treadmill.

938
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,540
So the giving would be the hug and the receiving would be anticipating receiving something.

939
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,540
Not – but still in the phase – okay.

940
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,760
This is the detail that I can't – I have to underscore.

941
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,600
When someone says I'm going to give you something, it's in the car.

942
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,840
When they depart from that point and you're waiting for them to show up again, before

943
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,940
they show up, that's the feeling.

944
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,700
Once they show up and they're carrying something and you see what they're carrying, the empathy

945
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,380
falls away.

946
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,740
It starts to fade away because now you know – you start to form the construct.

947
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,820
Oh, it's a small box or it's really small.

948
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,980
It might be jewelry, right?

949
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,060
Or it's something that's really heavy.

950
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Oh, it might be some stereo, right?

951
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,540
Or something, right?

952
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,020
Or TV.

953
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,040
So it's the open-ended reception.

954
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,880
It's not about the focus on the particulars.

955
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,320
It's about –

956
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,740
Exactly.

957
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,180
It's the notion of knowing you're going to receive something and you don't know what

958
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,500
it is.

959
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,080
Otherwise, you're not really an empath.

960
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,900
You're coloring the situation, right?

961
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:39,800
Okay.

962
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,560
So it would be like also receiving a guest.

963
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,040
You come over at 4 o'clock.

964
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,080
4 o'clock comes around and you know they should be here but there's no sign of them

965
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,100
here yet at all.

966
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,680
No sign.

967
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,620
Like they haven't pulled up.

968
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,980
You looked out in the distance.

969
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,220
Where are they?

970
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,980
That is also you're trying to receive, right?

971
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,680
But once you see them in the distance, the empathy then now becomes colored, becomes

972
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,220
constructive and it's no longer empathy.

973
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,820
Now, you're relying on your eyes or your ears or your previous experiences.

974
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,020
The thing about being a good empath is not putting any conditions on or attaching it

975
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,740
to anything that you've ever had before or accepted as a thought before.

976
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,560
It's completely new thinking, completely new thought, right?

977
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,140
Okay.

978
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,980
That's the cleanest, right?

979
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,940
Otherwise, you're coloring.

980
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,180
Otherwise, you're overlaying what you think it should be and it's not.

981
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,720
It can be but you're not an empath.

982
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,200
And you're narrowing it down at that point, right?

983
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:44,560
Because now the anticipation before also involves a lot of unexpected things that could occur.

984
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,740
Yeah, there's no presumption.

985
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,340
So there's no – yeah, there you go.

986
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,300
There's no presumption.

987
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,700
Yeah.

988
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,060
If there's any presumption, there's no empathy.

989
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,760
There we go.

990
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,160
Okay.

991
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,160
That's why the legal system is based on presumption.

992
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,800
Okay, views on cannabis, so many types, so whatever.

993
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,100
It's not for me.

994
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,800
Is it a positive thing?

995
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,980
Yeah, I would say so.

996
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,380
I think it's one of those things that – you know how they say if voting did anything,

997
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,880
it would be illegal, right?

998
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,660
So cannabis was made illegal.

999
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,460
Guess why?

1000
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,640
Because it was good for you, right?

1001
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,140
Like raw milk is illegal, right?

1002
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:21,940
Right.

1003
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,260
So just from a political, administrative, governmental, societal point of view, if

1004
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,540
it's made illegal, it probably has benefits to it.

1005
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,020
Personally, it's not for me.

1006
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,520
There are certain things that are not for me.

1007
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,320
It's just not for me.

1008
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,840
It turns me into a piece of the furniture.

1009
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,040
So but yeah, if you use it well, yeah.

1010
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,120
That's what I see.

1011
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:49,280
I think what I would like to start experimenting with is since – if you go to a smoke shop,

1012
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,000
it's all these cannabinoids now, right?

1013
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,440
Yeah.

1014
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,960
There are even drinks like sodas, like little $5 sodas with – I don't know, all kinds

1015
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,320
of stuff.

1016
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,320
I'd like to try it out.

1017
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,440
I haven't.

1018
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,320
We'll see.

1019
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,520
To be continued.

1020
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,360
Use of liquid mercury in ancient structures.

1021
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,300
Well, not only that.

1022
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,820
It was medicine.

1023
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,380
When people had some kind of food poisoning, they drank a half a cup of mercury, believe

1024
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:12,860
it or not.

1025
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,420
Okay.

1026
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,240
Back in the days – and it makes you think about these things.

1027
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,040
Well, remember like you experienced it growing up roughly when I did.

1028
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,620
When you had a cut, you went into the medicine chest and you put what on it?

1029
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:32,320
Mercurochrome, which was chromium and mercury, which are two like class A hazardous things

1030
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,760
right now.

1031
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,400
Yeah, you can't get it.

1032
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,200
It was very effective.

1033
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,500
You can't get it anymore.

1034
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,140
No.

1035
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,100
What they did was they decided to ban it because they dipped the baby in it, an entire infant

1036
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,040
and the baby died from it, of course, right?

1037
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,580
So you could have just drowned it in water and banned water but they would love to do

1038
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,580
that but they can't because that will be a revolution.

1039
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:51,340
Right.

1040
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,140
Okay.

1041
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
Use of liquid mercury in ancient structures.

1042
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,500
Yeah, it's a dielectric and a conductor.

1043
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,180
It's both.

1044
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,540
It's very yin and it could carry a lot of yang energy.

1045
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,400
I'll just leave it as that.

1046
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:14,340
Of course, most of the areas in South America where they suggested there were people being

1047
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:21,140
sacrificed, which they did also, these rock structures that were carvings that look like

1048
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,300
someone would lay down and have their heart removed, was actually they're finding evidence

1049
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,480
that they were just pouring mercury down these pyramids.

1050
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,900
So, yeah, lots of mercury.

1051
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:39,260
It's, yeah, lots of myth about it because, again, it's considered a hazardous substance

1052
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,260
now just to keep it out of people's minds, right?

1053
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,820
But, again, it's not something that's easily available.

1054
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,560
Okay, thoughts on people like Ram Dass, Terence McKenna.

1055
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,120
Not much.

1056
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,160
Don't know much about him.

1057
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,780
I have been exposed to them.

1058
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,040
Didn't do anything for me.

1059
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,340
Different pathway.

1060
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,620
Too much presumption.

1061
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:08,940
Too much carryover from formal academia, I guess, which is toxic, right?

1062
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,480
It's been too adulterated.

1063
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,500
There's some people out there that are on the alternative fringe on different things

1064
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,480
and they start making...

1065
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,160
I'll give you an example.

1066
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,560
Alternative medicine people.

1067
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,040
Oh, we found that this herb lowers blood pressure.

1068
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,980
Oh, my gosh.

1069
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
It just destroyed you.

1070
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,760
Oh, my gosh, right?

1071
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,640
Or this will help you with diabetes.

1072
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
Oh, my gosh.

1073
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,120
Oh, my gosh.

1074
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,220
There's no diabetes.

1075
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,720
By the way, dementia is now considered type three diabetes.

1076
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,620
Yeah, well, okay.

1077
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:43,040
It can't get any more in your face than it is.

1078
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,880
There's no such thing.

1079
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,940
It's a liver dysfunction and it goes really...

1080
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,100
It's just like AIDS.

1081
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,180
You start taking our treatment, you will get worse and worse and worse.

1082
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,260
You go from insulin shots to kidney failure to death.

1083
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,520
And parts of your body, you get arms and feet cut off, right?

1084
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,780
Usually feet, right?

1085
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,500
Yeah, feet.

1086
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,880
The yin part, yeah, feet.

1087
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,040
It's always the lower part.

1088
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,580
Yeah, because the yang energy runs away.

1089
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,620
So, yeah, if you are getting treatment for diabetes or whatever,

1090
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,840
you will get worse and worse and worse because there is no such thing.

1091
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,780
It's a liver dysfunction.

1092
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,060
Same with AIDS.

1093
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,760
If you get tested for AIDS and get treatment, you will die for sure.

1094
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,320
If you say that you've been tested positive for AIDS,

1095
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,840
you laugh and say there's no such thing.

1096
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,140
Bye.

1097
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,040
It's just like saying stay home because Santa Claus is coming, right?

1098
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,820
This is how we do it.

1099
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,560
It's in your face.

1100
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,160
It can't be any more in your face than it is already, you know,

1101
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:34,940
about all these things.

1102
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,200
And high blood pressure, there's like what,

1103
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,460
40 million Americans on blood pressure medication,

1104
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,440
which destroys your liver.

1105
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,600
Statin medication destroys the liver, right?

1106
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,280
They're all, right?

1107
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,820
You know, if you're that.

1108
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,320
Here's coming like I did the credit card analogy, right?

1109
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:52,640
Most people who use credit cards don't know how the money system works,

1110
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,340
but if you do and you use it, you're an idiot because basically

1111
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,680
you're destroying the system.

1112
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,340
Here's the thing.

1113
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,060
If you're that stupid that you think you have AIDS or diabetes,

1114
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,400
you may be deserved to, you know, that kind of,

1115
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,380
I'm not that type of person because if I ran into someone like that,

1116
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,380
I'd say stop what you're doing with them immediately and show them it

1117
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:13,500
does.

1118
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,240
I don't care about what they're giving you.

1119
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,360
It's not, you shouldn't have never believed it in the first place.

1120
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:18,640
Right?

1121
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,040
Right.

1122
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,640
So, but if you do continue down that path and you don't have a way out,

1123
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,680
I don't know, call it natural selection, whatever.

1124
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,200
I don't know.

1125
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,940
I can't,

1126
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,120
I can't go down that route because the outreach,

1127
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,560
it's so obvious that what this is medical fiction, you know,

1128
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,740
they've almost put it out there without saying it.

1129
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,600
It should be obvious at this point.

1130
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,040
And the constant is they always have something new and then they reinsert

1131
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,140
opium into the equation.

1132
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,140
And that's,

1133
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,260
what do you mean by opium?

1134
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:48,560
Well,

1135
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:49,640
the,

1136
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,680
anything that they,

1137
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,040
you know,

1138
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,300
is an opioid derivative,

1139
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:52,960
whatever.

1140
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,320
Fentanyl stuff.

1141
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:54,700
Yeah.

1142
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm all for fentanyl by the way,

1143
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,480
but not the way that it's gotten the rap.

1144
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,660
If you can have create something as 20,

1145
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,020
30,

1146
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:02,320
40,

1147
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,740
50,

1148
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,720
80 times stronger than heroin or morphine.

1149
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,540
Well,

1150
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,520
now you can have these tiny little,

1151
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,760
like if someone's in an act included in a,

1152
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,040
in,

1153
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,360
in,

1154
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,720
in a medical kits,

1155
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,800
because when people get into a really bad accident,

1156
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,340
right.

1157
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,760
Most people will die from trauma when they don't have to from pain,

1158
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,540
take,

1159
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,860
you know,

1160
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,780
make a tiny little pinprick that will numb it out until you can get

1161
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,680
the proper alignment or,

1162
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,120
you know,

1163
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,280
treatment.

1164
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,860
Right.

1165
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,220
Instead of dying from pain,

1166
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,100
make it available,

1167
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:33,990
but in a very respectable,

1168
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,020
responsible way.

1169
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:36,520
Right.

1170
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,860
Well,

1171
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,120
yeah,

1172
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:37,520
exactly.

1173
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,600
But that's the thing.

1174
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,040
I have no problem with opium in and of itself,

1175
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,740
but the thing is they keep reintroducing these different derivative

1176
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,300
products.

1177
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:46,960
And that's,

1178
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,360
but it's part of the cycle of the popular,

1179
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,100
like right now there's this thing called Ozempic.

1180
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,740
Have you heard of it?

1181
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,120
No,

1182
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:54,600
no,

1183
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,140
I tried it years ago.

1184
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,760
I might've,

1185
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,200
if it was new now,

1186
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,640
I try to just to look the other way.

1187
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,380
Cause it's just so ridiculous what they're doing.

1188
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:01,660
No,

1189
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,680
I think we did mention anything that's come out less than 20 years is void.

1190
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:07,820
Yeah.

1191
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,020
No,

1192
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,200
but,

1193
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,940
but the thing about this is that,

1194
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,320
you know,

1195
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,180
every,

1196
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,480
every 10 years or so,

1197
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,440
there is a brand new look.

1198
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,720
This is the miracle drug,

1199
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,140
right?

1200
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,700
This is the miracle drug.

1201
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,060
And I mean,

1202
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,960
I'm talking about for the,

1203
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,560
for the existence of this thing called the United States for the past

1204
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,200
coming from the medical morons.

1205
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,420
Yeah.

1206
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,820
People don't know better because they spend most of their effort that you

1207
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,040
trust them and no effort on quote unquote science.

1208
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,380
Right.

1209
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,360
But the thing is,

1210
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,600
but the thing that is noticeable is a continuous pattern of here's the new

1211
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,300
miracle drug.

1212
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,500
Here's the new thing.

1213
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,340
Here's the new thing.

1214
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,500
And it's always,

1215
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,000
and constantly the thing that really ends up killing people.

1216
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:43,940
Yeah.

1217
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,640
That's the idea.

1218
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:44,960
Yeah.

1219
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,820
And that is the idea,

1220
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,700
but it's just amazing to me that it's like,

1221
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:47,920
you know,

1222
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,560
no matter what,

1223
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,900
nobody ever picks up on it.

1224
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,960
Even afterwards they go,

1225
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,160
well,

1226
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,920
that drug was bad.

1227
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,700
We got to get rid of it.

1228
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,420
Here's your lawsuit.

1229
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,340
Here's the,

1230
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:54,600
this,

1231
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:54,980
here's the,

1232
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:55,720
you know,

1233
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,680
it's job security for the attorneys.

1234
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,320
Right.

1235
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,320
And that's all it is is continuous job security for the attorneys,

1236
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,760
but also security for the,

1237
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,000
you know,

1238
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,140
the two main companies.

1239
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,020
Cause believe it or not,

1240
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,700
there's only two that actually handled the distribution of drugs.

1241
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,380
You know what I mean?

1242
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,060
And it goes above.

1243
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:12,640
It's the,

1244
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,740
who holds those companies?

1245
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,480
Probably the,

1246
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:14,760
you know,

1247
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,580
what we're told Vanguard,

1248
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,800
black rock and all that.

1249
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,300
Right.

1250
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:17,640
Right.

1251
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,300
And that's,

1252
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,240
and that's the beauty of it.

1253
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,840
But what I find funny is that there's always a miracle drug,

1254
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,180
you know,

1255
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,040
like in the nineties,

1256
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,900
the psychotropic,

1257
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,440
they say there's a miracle drug.

1258
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,180
There isn't.

1259
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,400
Well,

1260
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,100
but in the nineties,

1261
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,300
the miracle drug would be pristine food when there wouldn't be a drug.

1262
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:32,640
Exactly.

1263
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,200
But actually,

1264
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:33,480
you know,

1265
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,740
I needed oxygen about 10 years ago for a water processing.

1266
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,700
And I called around,

1267
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,500
they're like,

1268
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:38,700
we,

1269
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,420
you can't buy oxygen without a license.

1270
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,540
Cause it's a drug.

1271
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,060
This is how brainwashed they are.

1272
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,000
I think it's,

1273
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,280
yeah,

1274
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,900
it's time for the mop up crew.

1275
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,440
You know what I mean?

1276
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:48,660
It's,

1277
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,060
it's going to get a lot worse before it gets any better.

1278
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,220
That's why they introduced the term controlled substance,

1279
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,940
you know?

1280
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Cause yeah.

1281
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,240
And classified it.

1282
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:57,440
Yeah.

1283
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,980
But look,

1284
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,820
if people are going to accept that,

1285
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,400
maybe they deserve the side effects of it.

1286
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,540
Ah,

1287
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,100
understood.

1288
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,180
So do you have anything else left in that email?

1289
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:07,640
No,

1290
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,140
that's it.

1291
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,180
Yeah.
