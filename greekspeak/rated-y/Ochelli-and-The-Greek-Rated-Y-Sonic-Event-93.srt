1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:16,240
This is Sonic Event 93, Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, how you doing, Greek, what's going

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,520
on?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,420
Okay, good, it seems I got my voice back, or a voice, and yeah, let's see what we could

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,980
talk about today.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,820
Well, it sounds really strong.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,920
What are we up to, 93 or something?

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,500
Yeah, 93, 93.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,600
It sounds really strong.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
I mean, we've been pretty regular.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,560
We took a little break this week because, you know, your voice was out for a bit, as

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,520
you told them in the chat.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,880
If you guys aren't looking at the chat, we do have a chatango, which we mentioned before.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,640
Let's see, the exact address, let me pull that up real fast, just to make sure I got

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:45,980
it right.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,600
And it's, yeah, ocelliinthegreek.chatango.com.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,040
It's the old basic chat room.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,560
You don't even have to sign into it if you don't want to, you can go in there anonymously

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,380
and all that good stuff, and put some feedback in there.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,160
There's other discussions going on between listeners and so on and so forth.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,740
Okay, so with that having been said, but you did mention in there that your voice was down.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,220
Your voice sounds really good, actually.

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,800
It doesn't sound like mine does.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
Usually when mine recovers, it's still weak for a little bit.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Yeah, I did some sleep therapy and did some different stuff and actually got out and about

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,160
more than I usually do and didn't behave like I normally do, which is engage people.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,720
I usually engage people and when I'm out in public, I start making Greek-speak comments

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,760
and typically I'm at a place like Home Depot or the grocery store or whatever, and people

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,660
start gathering.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,960
Hey, why don't you write a book, and I give them the answer, right, and all that.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,460
So, public speaking, and I didn't do any of that.

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,220
I just was very, I didn't yell at the cats or do anything like that either.

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,560
I actually just babied the voice, but it works.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I know, it's working good.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,280
I mean, me, if I sleep, it gets worse because I'm one of these open-mouthed sleepers, you

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,380
know, I snore and all that.

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah, there's remedies for that.

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,720
Yeah, there's remedies for that.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,720
You could do the yin and yang on that.

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,840
You know, that's yin manifestation.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,320
People that clench their teeth would be yang manifestation, so a very slight bit of adjustment

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,780
before you go to sleep, you know.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,600
And by the way, when you say yin and yang, a lot of people consider it to be, the easiest

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
approach is chemical.

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,340
Again, you know how we always harp on the pharmaceuticals because they just use chemicals,

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,680
right?

46
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:39,980
Right.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,300
But yin and yang can be that way as well, so if you want to displace the yin, take something

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,680
a little salty, and if you want to displace the yang, take something a little bit sweet,

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:50,980
right?

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,620
Okay.

51
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
So, yeah.

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,200
In other words, balance it out, cancel it out, right?

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,560
If something's hot, you put cold, if it's cold, you put hot, same thing, yin and yang.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,060
Yeah, these little tiny remedies, you know, I've walked this earth now for, I mean, my

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,440
sixth decade, almost going to my seventh decade in another year or two, and I've always just

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,340
tried to share little snippets, I guess they call them, you know, of information to people.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,300
And you know, if they can't take a quick explanation without getting cross-eyed, right, you bring

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,940
up why someone should do, you know, what someone can do and why and how, they go cross-eyed

59
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,660
because they're not used to getting that kind of information, they're used to being raised

60
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,060
in a society where this is the way it is, don't ask any questions, right?

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,120
So they're not used to it.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:45,880
So, yeah, I've been applying this kind of remedies to people around me, and I always ask, you

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,540
know, let me know, let me know how it works out.

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,320
If I don't see you again, here's my phone number, call me, right?

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,860
Because you need feedback, right?

66
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,240
Anybody can say anything, yeah.

67
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,960
Well, always, and I'll tell you, it's strange, occasionally, if you hand somebody a tidbit

68
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,140
like that, it might take a little while, especially if you live in a, well, I mean, you live in

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,340
a, you've been in the same town now for quite a while, right?

70
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
25 years plus, yeah.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,760
Yeah, so, I mean, eventually, you might run back into somebody, even a couple years later,

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,800
and even if they didn't call you back, they might say to you something, hey, you know,

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,160
I saw you a few years ago, you ever have that happen?

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah, yeah, I've had people in checkout come out of line and come up to me and say, hey,

75
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,540
I remember, remember you were talking to us a few years ago at blah, blah, blah, you know,

76
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,740
at this place?

77
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,360
And I was like, no, I don't remember, but what did I say?

78
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,120
Typical Greek-speak recall, which, by the way, the typical, the basis for the Greek-speak

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,360
is when you hear something, a new idea, a piece of knowledge, something you're not aware

80
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,100
of, first thing, the thing is, what's your source for that, right?

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
What's your source?

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,780
And then, when someone gives you the source, it tells you a lot, right?

83
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Let's say someone brings up a little snippet, and they say, of information or something,

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,300
dialogue, what's your source?

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,700
New York Times, wow, that tells you a lot, right?

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,340
Or if they say the Bible, or college, I learned that in college, and I usually, when they

87
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,600
say college, they say what year, which year, right, because I'm curious.

88
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,600
So you get to go, right, so we know what they're doing in college, we know what the New York

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,780
Times is doing, right?

90
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,300
And when they say the Bible, are you reading an English version, are you reading a version,

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,540
or did you get into the original languages?

92
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,260
That tells you a lot right away there, too, right?

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,800
A lot.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,340
And another point of reference could be, look, from experience, I know this, right?

95
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,880
I always take a piece of information a lot more serious when they say, look, I've done

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,220
this.

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,820
And it works.

98
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah, and from experience, I, again, ask, how did you get there?

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
In other words, did you experience it because you were instructed, or it just so happened

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,320
that you observed it, right?

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,460
But the problem is, again, most people can't communicate.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,860
They're not good at stringing words together, first of all.

103
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,920
Well, and here's the other thing, do they have recall of where they got the information

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,260
from?

105
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,380
That's another part of it, because I often have ended up in conversations with people

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,360
where I want to know where they got the information from, too.

107
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,180
Well, yeah.

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,840
Well, if they don't have recall, then you take the information.

109
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,220
And you know, I was talking to someone the other day who wanted a water device.

110
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,240
He owns a shop and a grocery store, actually, a health food store.

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,700
And basically, I said, you know, I've been using this stupid rectangle only for a few

112
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,220
months now.

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,480
And he says, yeah, you could find out anything on there.

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
And I'm like, yeah, maybe anything.

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,040
Yeah, but not everything.

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,080
Anything.

117
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,820
Yeah, that's right.

118
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,220
Yeah.

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
I said, yeah, I'd catch myself there, right?

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
So he's, you know, very impressed.

121
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,940
But he knows sort of what's going on, but not really.

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,940
I didn't lay into him too hard.

123
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:11,880
But in other words, you have these devices, they're cameras that happen to be able to access

124
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,200
the Internet, right?

125
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,780
And used as a telephone, right?

126
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,740
That's the primary function is a camera, right?

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,680
At this point, it's a camera now.

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,580
It's a camera that happens to also be able to make phone calls.

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,140
What's great about that, though, is, you know, much like, look, neither one of us is a fan

130
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,540
of YouTube.

131
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,120
But we see.

132
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,040
Oh, by the way, I got to say something about that.

133
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah, go ahead.

134
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,180
Sam or Archon from Greek speak, decided to do YouTube, go up on YouTube for whatever

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,920
reason.

136
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,960
And I don't endorse that.

137
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,640
I'm not saying it's OK.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,900
And I'm not really completely against it where I'm like, go, you know, take it down.

139
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,200
Right.

140
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,680
Right.

141
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,520
He made a an executive decision on that.

142
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,780
And that's I'm I'm I'm I fine with it.

143
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,040
Let's just say I'm going to be neutral with it.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
But I would never personally do it.

145
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,800
And when I say, look, let's say you wanted to put all this stuff on YouTube in the future

146
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,340
or whatever.

147
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,740
Right.

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,140
I wouldn't get on the I wouldn't get on the horn and lay into you for doing that.

149
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,440
Right.

150
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
Or anyone at all.

151
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,140
Really.

152
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,740
Just when I when I express my wish to say dissatisfaction with YouTube, it's a mild

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,440
way to put it.

154
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
It's personal.

155
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,900
Like, I won't do it.

156
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,720
You know, I'm never going to say, you know, I'm never going to consider it an option.

157
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,620
But you don't consider it an option.

158
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,100
But you do see that there can be a practical use for it in a way, because I personally

159
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,740
didn't do that.

160
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
See, I would go the other way personally.

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,380
But if yourself or anyone else that I'm working with on this or is working with me or whatever

162
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,120
wants to do it, if you know, go ahead.

163
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
But I don't.

164
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,720
I will not.

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,640
Because not not not not for the point of creating content.

166
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,940
What I'm saying is, is that you do find a use for the platform in that you've told me

167
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,220
before.

168
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,900
Look, you can go on YouTube and see how to do something and watch a step.

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,340
Oh, yeah.

170
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,740
I think from as a creator, as input for output, in other words, I would never upload anything

171
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,780
right to YouTube.

172
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,300
No, no.

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,020
I get that part.

174
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,680
What I'm saying is even even even let's say on the business end with the water device

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,840
and it's not really a business, it's I want to talk a little bit about that from a perspective

176
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,140
that I've never discussed publicly either.

177
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
But I would not do it as a primary either.

178
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,280
I would go to one another.

179
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,620
Look, and if we say there's other ones, Vimeo, whatever you can name, they're just as you

180
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,860
know, they they use they use what you call YouTube as their benchmark.

181
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,240
Right.

182
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,540
Remember, those people that left YouTube because of censorship.

183
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,260
Right.

184
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,240
They went to the and then they got dropped and they got censored on there also.

185
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Right.

186
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,340
You've heard of that.

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,140
Or am I just.

188
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,780
No, that happened.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,720
There was a bunch of video platforms.

190
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,400
Some of them folded up, went away.

191
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
You know, a couple other ones are still around.

192
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,200
They're still, you know, presenting themselves as the option to YouTube.

193
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,260
But again, they're still using YouTube as the benchmark, like you said.

194
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,000
Right.

195
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,220
Right.

196
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,080
So if they see YouTube going on a censoring binge or whatever, they do it also.

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Right.

198
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,860
So they're not much better.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,820
So but I want to bring up something just a little segue regarding like what I'm doing

200
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,720
with the scale rater and the water devices.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,600
The primary thing is I consider it Magnus Magnum Opus my greatest work ever to make.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,420
And it's the dumbed down version that I've been presenting.

203
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,320
There's another version that's far more complicated, not the double one, the gen two, but it's

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,380
a triple component.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,520
I call it a terbit error.

206
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,960
That's where you put water that is not clear, like looks like tea or light coffee and it

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,480
comes out clear through the device.

208
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,220
It's insane.

209
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,020
It's it's.

210
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,680
Yeah.

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,440
And I have not presented that.

212
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:47,720
Right.

213
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,100
And that might be presented maybe in a year or two or less.

214
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,460
I don't know.

215
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,600
But what I want to say is I want to get this out to people, right, and have them use it

216
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,600
because when I first put this together, I was having a conversation with someone here

217
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,560
who has a if you put in structured water, Tucson, she's the first Web site on top of

218
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,320
the Google search.

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,620
Right.

220
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,060
And I remember the earth's air, water or whatever is a Web something.

221
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,740
Anyway, I mentioned to her that you don't need many of these devices if they're built

222
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,500
well to basically clean up all the water in an entire state.

223
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Why? Because, you know, when you hook up when you put this in line and, you know, when a

224
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,060
water main, let's say, or any device flow through or not flow through, you expect all the

225
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,140
water that's upstream to be your control.

226
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,320
And there's and when it goes through whatever device you're using, this or any device

227
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,920
filters, whatever, that there's a change in the water downstream.

228
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,640
Right. Because it went through the device.

229
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,440
Right. Right.

230
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,600
Well, when you connect this device into the water main, it starts changing the water

231
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,660
upstream. Before the water even runs through, it starts changing, doesn't make any sense.

232
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,740
Right. Well, you know what it does on an induction level.

233
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
Right. Well, I was going to ask the reverse question, which is even though it's been

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,500
treated now, it continues on down the line and further on down the line.

235
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,540
There's a problem. Couldn't it reacquire problems?

236
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
You know, unless it go with this for a while, for a minute.

237
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,480
Yeah. Walk with me on this.

238
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,200
All right. So when you attach this to a line and it's sitting there day after day, it

239
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,660
starts cleaning up the water that has not gone through it yet.

240
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,800
Upstream. You know what I mean by upstream?

241
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,820
Upstream is prior.

242
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,260
It's called the influent and affluent is what comes out.

243
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:51,080
OK. Right. So it's kind of like I've given this analogy before when there's a down

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,460
power line. Right.

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,240
Right. You don't have to go to the end where it's broken to touch it, to get hit with a

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
current. Right. You can grab it further up.

247
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,680
Right. Or either side.

248
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,640
Right. Right. It's kind of like a wire with no insulation.

249
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,940
Doesn't matter where you grab it.

250
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,840
Right. It's kind of like this takes care of what's called Faraday's paradox a little bit,

251
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,020
which is not a paradox when you talk about induction.

252
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,340
But my reason for getting this out to the public is.

253
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:24,160
It's one way of kicking the establishment in the shins before you go, because I remember

254
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,360
being in the labs with Halliburton back in 2012 and I was talking about inline devices

255
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,280
with no consumables, no consumables, which means you don't have to buy anything once you

256
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,420
put the thing in. There's nothing to replace.

257
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,660
Nothing wears out. Right.

258
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,700
Right. And they looked at me very angrily, the senior engineer.

259
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,760
And he says, no, if people want clean water, they have to pay for it.

260
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Right. And that really let me know earlier on or 10.

261
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,100
That's not really that early, but still 12 years ago, what kind of a rotten, you know,

262
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,680
establishment it is.

263
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,360
Right. Well, it's typical because like every other business model, like medicine or

264
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,060
whatever, it's not about curing something.

265
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,880
It's about giving you a treatment to mask things so that they continue having what a

266
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,260
customer or repeat customers, what they're building.

267
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,220
So what I want to do is because I was thinking doing video website, wherever there might

268
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,880
be a small website, but it's got to look.

269
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,100
Not whenever I speak to someone regarding this and a buyer seller relations conversation

270
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,760
starts happening, I cut the conversation short, you know what I mean?

271
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,920
Like I'm selling and they're buying, you know, you know, if you listen to a buyer seller

272
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
conversation, doesn't matter what it is.

273
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,900
You could tell who's selling and who's buying.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,260
Right. Oh, yeah. If you were to eavesdrop or listen to what we did.

275
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,780
OK, we're transcript or whatever.

276
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,640
Soon as I start noticing that kind of language happening, I say, OK, I got to go.

277
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,060
We'll get in touch another time because it's not what it's about.

278
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,260
Right. It's it has a different purpose.

279
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,880
So when I were to do anything online, like a website or video or whatever, it has to

280
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,260
look like someone is on the receiving end of this device, not on the selling or

281
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,180
creating. And he's got this device magically fell out of the air or the stork brought it

282
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,400
to tell little children where the babies come from.

283
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,760
Right. And right.

284
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,160
Stork brought this thing.

285
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,060
I was in it. I opened the door as a basket and I hooked it up and it's cleaning up the

286
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,340
water. That's it. That's that's as far as the information, you know, the packet of

287
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,780
information that goes out to the world is, look, there's this thing and, you know, the

288
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,740
thing is this thing and it does this.

289
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,340
That's it. Right.

290
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,800
So this is very contrary.

291
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Why am I bringing this up?

292
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,560
Because in the past month, I've been speaking to people that are into marketing,

293
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,520
advertising, website building, blah, blah, blah.

294
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,700
You get it, right? Yeah, of course.

295
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,040
And they're all like, oh, you got to market this and you take it to markets.

296
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm not taking it to market.

297
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,320
There's no market. They're like, oh, yeah.

298
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,260
The minute you sell it, someone I've never there's never not selling them.

299
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,100
Right. Someone asked me, how many of you sold none?

300
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,940
Right. You know why?

301
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,260
Right. Right. Well, you went over the contract.

302
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
You know, it's a 90 year lease, one time settlement.

303
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,820
Right. So. So these people don't get it.

304
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,540
What do you mean by these people?

305
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,180
Who are you calling these people?

306
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,600
Right. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

307
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,300
This is so different.

308
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,940
Yes, Ivan.

309
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,160
It's so different. You see what you say.

310
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,980
So it's in line with what I've been talking about, isn't it?

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,940
So I'm just trying to share that Greek speak is also walking your talk and

312
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,380
talking your walk, if you know it.

313
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,640
By the way, I can read along.

314
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,540
Maybe I could read an abridged one from someone who has built.

315
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,440
Let me just do this.

316
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,000
And I don't want to make this about the scale or whatever, but.

317
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm going to read a message that I got from someone.

318
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,320
That. Built one, OK, and

319
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,620
OK, you had some I'll just read the whole thing.

320
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,320
And they're a sub, I think, because they're well, yeah, they were in the

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,640
seminar. OK, this is a text that they sent me through the phone.

322
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,280
OK. Had some positive results Thursday, 40 p.m.

323
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,260
went down to about twenty nine p.m.

324
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,599
parts per million. Right.

325
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,859
So about a twenty five percent reduction.

326
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I'll be testing again today with some adjustments.

327
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,960
Are you getting over 50 percent reduction consistently?

328
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,280
Oh, and the kitchen sink went from 40 p.m.

329
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,599
to 30 p.m. even with the phone.

330
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,340
Even though even though the scale rater was hooked up to a garden hose outside.

331
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,120
So I can confirm what you said about upstream quality also improving.

332
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,080
Took a few hours after unhooking it for the kitchen to go back up to 40.

333
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,960
There was a lingering effect and and it keeps going on.

334
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,820
Then I made a couple of comments.

335
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,400
And I've been listening to for years.

336
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,380
There's all again. But seeing the results of my own handiwork is something else.

337
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,020
It's an incredible invention you come up with.

338
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,060
Anyway, so I constantly have people see if you test it like I've had people that had

339
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,500
labs. There's no lab that will test this like this, by the way, because it goes

340
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,840
contrary. Right. Right.

341
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,940
To what they're used to doing.

342
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
You just do labs.

343
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,140
You give them a water sample.

344
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,160
You don't give them a device, you know, because it's going to cut into their lunch

345
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,420
hour. So what I'm trying to say is that

346
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,220
the only way to really see what's going on is to what do it right or have one.

347
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I think I've mentioned before people that have gotten one are very skeptical.

348
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,760
And they're like, you know, when this is connected, I'm going to take a water sample

349
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,680
to the lab to find out what it's really doing.

350
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,200
And the moment I was like, fine, the moment it's connected, I said, take a drink of

351
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,800
the tap water, take a taste of it now.

352
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,140
Oh, no, no way.

353
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,920
I would never drink that. So we're just just taste it.

354
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,960
And they taste it, their eyes open up.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm like, you still want a lab sample tested.

356
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,000
They're like, no, that won't be necessary.

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,820
My gosh, what could change?

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,900
How drastic. Right.

359
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,060
You see what I mean? So it's it's the paraphrasing, the typical.

360
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,880
OK, so you can do a YouTube video or website and try to explain this to someone.

361
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,680
Good luck. Not going to happen.

362
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,700
Well, people have to experience it.

363
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,100
Yeah. Well, first of all, it doesn't make sense that you're telling me the upstream

364
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,880
water has changed because it hasn't been affected by the device.

365
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,000
That's the way most people would think about it.

366
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Right. So since that water hasn't been affected yet, it can't possibly have changed.

367
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,800
Well, it has been affected because what's going on is an induction.

368
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
It's like Faraday's paradox.

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,140
And if you're familiar with it, you can rotate the magnet.

370
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,060
In other words, anyway, look, you can look up.

371
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,240
There's probably YouTube videos on Faraday's paradox.

372
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,740
And if you listening to Greek speak, you'll see it's not a paradox at all.

373
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,680
It's just a failure.

374
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,340
Of the physics that they're teaching.

375
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,640
Right. Because they write, they're talking about electrons flowing.

376
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,800
There's no there's no electron.

377
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,780
It's just pressurizing.

378
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,380
Right. By the ether that's around everything.

379
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,320
They don't know that there's no empty space.

380
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,780
Right. Yeah. Well, go ahead and if we really had empty space around that, we would not be

381
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,880
able to quote unquote generate electricity at all.

382
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,360
Right. So, you know, the analog of electricity and water.

383
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,820
Right. So where it's like fish.

384
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,000
You know, there's a crazy philosopher fish, you know, and he's trying to tell the other

385
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,160
fish, you know, there's a possibility that we're all underwater, right?

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
We're all in water. And they're like, this guy's crazy.

387
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,920
What he's talking about. Right.

388
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,860
But they all. One thing that I used to say is perhaps the last thing a fish realizes

389
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,800
when he's dying is that he's in water.

390
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,200
Right. Well, yeah.

391
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,380
I mean, again, if people have presented this concept of, you know, the fluidic other

392
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,420
universe, whatever.

393
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,300
And I say, well, what what is it that, you know.

394
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,420
Yeah, we are in a fluid.

395
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,420
If you are fluid in it, if you exist, it's not liquid.

396
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,480
It's not going to seem that way.

397
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,060
But to someone else where it's a lot thinner somehow, it might seem that way.

398
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,820
You know, so density again, density, pressure, direction.

399
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,900
Right. Ken Wheeler gets into that a lot.

400
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,320
But if you could. Ken Wheeler is pretty good.

401
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,220
My critique on him is he's not an idiot.

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
He's not a moron. He's actually smart.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,620
But he has very little wisdom and he touts himself for having a lot of wisdom.

404
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,920
So, you know, it's it's kind of like a loss there.

405
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm a little lost. I'm not knocking him, but he's he's an OK.

406
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,540
Listen, once in a while, you know, again, the biggest.

407
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,180
OK. You know, very part of the Greek speak thing also is what I talk about a bit

408
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,660
more. You know, when I meet people, I said, you know, because you're having this

409
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,760
problem because everyone, you know, is a freaking moron.

410
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,120
Right. And I tell him when I tell people, you know, no one has ever turned around

411
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,940
and said to me, oh, how could you say that?

412
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,540
I know plenty of people are not morons.

413
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,560
No one. No one. Everyone's like, yeah, they all agree.

414
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,400
When I tell people they're surrounded by idiots and morons, everyone's like, yeah.

415
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,040
I'm like, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

416
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,740
That's bad. You can't, you know.

417
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,440
So anyway, I get no what do you call a blowback when I get with those comments?

418
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,280
It's amazing because somebody that wants to engage with something other and is not

419
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,000
just willing to accept things on face value and on the value that they've been

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,440
given to accept them on might have the idea that they're not dealing with a

421
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,760
super intelligent population.

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
Well, no intelligence.

423
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,320
Well, you know, intelligence is a word that's constantly being overused.

424
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,640
OK. One of the earlier definitions is, you know, intelligence is measured by how

425
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,740
adaptable someone is.

426
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,000
Like if you put someone in a new environment like these intelligence IQ quotient

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
tests and all that, that's what it is.

428
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,240
You're taking someone from their everyday life and they agree to go into a new

429
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,480
environment, which is the IQ test and see how they can adapt to the questions.

430
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,400
Right. And how well they perform in adapting.

431
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,160
Because if you let's say you take an IQ test and if you fully adapt to it, you get

432
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,380
everything done very quickly.

433
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,640
Right. And you score very, very high.

434
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,080
If you don't adapt very well.

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,200
Right. You score very low.

436
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,740
It doesn't mean you're not intelligent, just that you're not adapting to the IQ test,

437
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,060
you see. And yeah, it's a whole thing.

438
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,000
It's about adaptation.

439
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,860
We used to call it improvising back in the day, you know, common sense,

440
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,040
improvising. Right.

441
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,120
So, you know, I always heard the phrase adapt and overcome because that's what you

442
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,840
have to do when you're faced with something.

443
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah. Well, OK.

444
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,780
I'm not trying to I'm trying to go with the marine thing here, but but that's what

445
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,040
it means. Yeah. But yeah, I get it.

446
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,920
Yeah. That's where intelligence is.

447
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,980
So, yeah, that's a that's a sticky surface, a sticky thing to deal with.

448
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,480
Intelligence. It's really I look for it.

449
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,040
Well, what I suggest is to look for adaptability, right, to a new environment, new

450
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,960
reset experiences, earlier situations.

451
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,020
And why would you adapt to what to prevail for yourself, for the benefit of yourself

452
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,320
and others? Yeah.

453
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,360
Generally, I mean, that's that's why you have to have some level of flexibility,

454
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,540
because I mean, look again, without direct experience, a lot of times you end up

455
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,540
taking the word of somebody like we were talking about before.

456
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,100
And where does it where did they get that information from?

457
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,260
Sometimes they don't know.

458
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,540
And that's the funny thing.

459
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,000
It doesn't mean that it's unreliable.

460
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
It just means.

461
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,320
Yeah, well, that's the normies are totally engrossed in what's called opinion.

462
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,040
Right. There's no truth with the normies at all.

463
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,080
So there's no circumstance or reference or baseline or references.

464
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,480
It's all opinion. Everything is all opinion.

465
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,760
And that's how they that's how they roll.

466
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,400
And that's fine because, you know, their background, you know, that's their part of

467
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,840
the background.

468
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,160
Yeah, and that's what makes it so it separates, you know, all these different

469
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,040
things. And that is the funny part, too, is when you do try to say, look,

470
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,940
empirically, here's what, you know, based on this, that third thing, you can say,

471
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,300
look, I've tested this myself.

472
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,780
I've read this. This is what has been said.

473
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,220
This is what appears to be.

474
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,200
And do you have any something that, you know, to the contrary?

475
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,500
And sometimes they'll just come out and say, well, I just feel like that's not

476
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,120
right. You know?

477
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,920
Well, yeah. And also when they say it appears to be, it's what appears to be

478
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,960
appearing to be meaning it's not at all.

479
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,760
And they're not interested. But that's OK.

480
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,120
We don't want to get into an NPC or that was like maybe a year or two ago or

481
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,260
harping on PCs. And that's part of the norm.

482
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,680
I've always brought up comments from old philosophers.

483
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,620
By the way, Plato was an asshole, by the way.

484
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,920
A lot of people that hold him up.

485
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,380
He's not really. Anyway, what Creek, why would you make a comment like that?

486
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,100
Just out of the blue like this sounds like Tourette's syndrome or something.

487
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,160
But yeah, but some of the better philosophers, the ones that are lesser known are

488
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,620
way better. If you read a lot of their comments and just strike them as

489
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,860
a quote and show them to someone today and say, when was this written?

490
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,080
And they'll say, this is about the people here today.

491
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,840
And like, no, this was written twenty five hundred years ago or two thousand years

492
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,340
ago. It's the same. So there's no reason to harp on the NPCs.

493
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,120
Right. Because they're always going to be here.

494
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,740
I mean, as long as the society has this type of framework.

495
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,740
Right. But again, what we got into the last time we spoke in terms of

496
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,100
framework is the I think in just a pair without paraphrasing

497
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,720
and adding something to it.

498
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,760
Remember Eisenhower's speech about the military industrial complex?

499
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,060
Of course. Yeah. And we were talking about the purpose of industry.

500
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,900
Right. And what's the techno feudalism and all that on the last sonic, I believe.

501
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,260
Right. Memory serves her well.

502
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,800
Yep. The military industrial complex, when he was talking about industrial,

503
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,100
he was not talking about the purpose fullness

504
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,640
of industry as we use it now, like factories making things

505
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,700
for people to buy. Right.

506
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,540
Or war. But it was locking in

507
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,400
production and the fiat currency together.

508
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,960
So the way it would overtake humanity

509
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,680
is by convincing humanity that they need a currency

510
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,700
to get anything and everything that they cannot.

511
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,800
Right. You see what I mean?

512
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,520
That you write. That was never.

513
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,160
And also we talked about there were no jobs prior to 1720 or 1700.

514
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,240
No such thing. You did what you know.

515
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,780
And you and you may do with it.

516
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,500
Right. Even you could be wealthy also.

517
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,260
But what industry's purpose was, was to show

518
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,660
or create a model for society that they were.

519
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,940
Everybody wants money to get stuff instead of if you want stuff, wanting the stuff.

520
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,220
That's why all these things about like law of attraction don't work

521
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,580
because people just say they want money.

522
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,200
How can you go into, quote unquote, a universal field asking for something

523
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,380
that is a complete lie?

524
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,900
The current current credit system breaks, which works on increasing

525
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,740
the money supply through lending, which means when someone borrows money,

526
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,780
they draw it off their signature and the money to pay it back doesn't exist.

527
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,220
Right. So it's constantly diluting.

528
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,500
It's a constant struggle.

529
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,340
It's in constant turmoil.

530
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,400
That's why whoever is in the future, watch the financial system.

531
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,020
People like the Basel people, you know, out of Sweden that do all the

532
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,420
the the theory behind it and all that.

533
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,060
They never put out real people.

534
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,300
They always put puppets out like Legrand or, you know, these

535
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,840
IMF people, none of them know anything about economics or puppets

536
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,100
because they can't put out the people that know what's going on

537
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,820
because they're going to have too many Freudian slips

538
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,620
and they're going to show that.

539
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,160
Why is this person look so terrible?

540
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,660
I mean, like they're in a panic all the time, right?

541
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,100
Because the system doesn't work.

542
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,540
But what it did do industry was it created a baseline

543
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,180
where people now still believe it or not, and will consider

544
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,560
that if they want something, they have to have money to get it.

545
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,240
Big mistake. Big, big, big, big mistake.

546
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,720
I assure you that if you want a car, a house, a wife or whatever,

547
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,620
and you think you have to just focus on getting money to get those things,

548
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,100
you're probably not going to get them.

549
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,220
But if you focus on wanting

550
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,200
and you want to, let's say, acquire a car, a house or a wife and just focus on that,

551
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,640
then you the money will appear to get those things.

552
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,380
You see the difference? Don't you see?

553
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,020
You see the so that's what the purpose of the military industrial

554
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,240
when he says industrial.

555
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,480
It was the bankers he was talking about.

556
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
And I have a lot to back this up.

557
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,680
I remember years ago, I did research with a bunch of guys back in the

558
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,660
between like oh three and oh five or six before the crash.

559
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,220
And I kept telling people the crash was going to happen in oh six.

560
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,460
It didn't happen in no way.

561
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,200
Just like I talked about, the pandemic would happen right before it did.

562
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,460
But it was I was I was thinking it would be

563
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:31,220
a before Trump actually came into office.

564
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,060
So with Obama. Right.

565
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,640
But anyway, these things, you can smell it in the air. Right.

566
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,120
But the research from back then was we were told that the economy grew

567
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,140
and all that stuff. Right. Right.

568
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,080
After postwar and all that. No, no.

569
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,100
It was trained. It was a training regimen.

570
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,140
It was to get people high and confident on liquidity.

571
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,520
Of money and products available and all that stuff

572
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,460
to trap them into what we now call the money system. Right.

573
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,260
And they're young children that just want money.

574
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,960
They don't know what they want. They just want money.

575
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,720
Yeah, I've heard even older people say, I like money.

576
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,960
I mean, idiocracy. I love money. Right. Right.

577
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,660
So, yeah. So this whole thing now

578
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,240
is, in other words, the ability to appreciate material goods,

579
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,340
even good food and good clothing has gone away.

580
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,300
Right. If you look at, for example, sometimes I go on YouTube

581
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,100
and they'll pull up like a fabric, whatever conversation we're having.

582
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,480
By the way, if I go on YouTube after we hang up, let's say. Right.

583
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,180
Actually, we shouldn't call it hang up anymore because we don't hang.

584
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,280
You remember the phone hit the red button, let's say. Right.

585
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,600
There will be suggestions based on all the various subjects

586
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
we talk about on YouTube videos. Yes, it will.

587
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,960
Yeah. How can it be?

588
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,140
Because I'm going to be going on a Lenovo

589
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,700
Windows based laptop where right now I'm speaking on an Apple iPhone.

590
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,300
How do they write? How do they cross it? Right.

591
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,240
You see. So Apple versus Microsoft.

592
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,200
I don't think so. Right.

593
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,120
So the other thing was the just to recap is the techno feudalism.

594
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,520
I don't know if I've said this before, but, you know, the Tesla cars. Yeah.

595
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,500
If OK, if they gave you a Tesla car for free and paid you

596
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,180
every time you got into it, they would still make money on them.

597
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,440
Why? Because we're Tesla's making their money.

598
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,840
You know what?

599
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,020
They were enriching themselves is every time you get into the car,

600
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,380
it goes up to the cloud.

601
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,580
What song you're listening to, what time you got into the cloud,

602
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,780
where you're going ties into all of your, you know, what you bought

603
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,900
and all that information, all that data, what do they call it?

604
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,080
Metadata is stored and sold by them, but not actually not by them.

605
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,980
If you do an audit on that, you'll see that there is a string of hundreds

606
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,640
of companies that relying on that data from Tesla cars.

607
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,240
So all of the whatever you paid to buy a Tesla,

608
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,500
they're making back several times every year.

609
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,320
What a scam. That's why when you see like Tesla didn't earn any,

610
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,460
didn't make any profit or they're losing money.

611
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,320
You hear that.

612
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't know if that's still the situation, but a few years ago,

613
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
it's like don't invest in Tesla because their company is losing money

614
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,780
on the production of the cars.

615
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,680
Yeah, but they're super, super ahead on the.

616
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,660
Does that make sense to you?

617
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,140
Yeah. Just like these phones. Yeah.

618
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,240
Well, Netflix, same thing, actually, because Netflix

619
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,040
was hemorrhaging money for about a decade.

620
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,740
And during that hemorrhaging, they somehow financed

621
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,660
a whole bunch of shows and this and that.

622
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,360
And they continued to be one of the top, you know, right.

623
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,660
Streamers, you're probably probably going to stream.

624
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,000
I think you could still get the old DVD in the mail from Netflix, too.

625
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,540
I don't think they've abandoned that service.

626
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,480
In most places, you still can sign up to Netflix

627
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,600
and they will send you a DVD in the mail like back in the early 2000s.

628
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,960
Well, I got to say, I don't know anybody who's done it in probably 15 years.

629
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,760
But but yeah, I heard it's still available, though.

630
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,660
But that was the source was someone that was talking about Netflix

631
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,080
financials like you just brought up.

632
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,420
But they're the same thing, because if you're watching Netflix,

633
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,400
you're probably on a smart device or a smart TV again or a Roku box,

634
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,960
which goes back and forth.

635
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,480
Yeah. Yeah. I just noticed the HDMI cables,

636
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,780
you know, that you hook up video and audio with one cable

637
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,560
that work both ways in two directions of you. Right.

638
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,620
Yes, it's quite interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

639
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,220
I wasn't I had I was suspect to that,

640
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,960
but I wasn't sure until recently that they communicate back and forth.

641
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,480
Oh, my gosh. Right.

642
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,040
So everything's right.

643
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,520
This is going up to the cloud.

644
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,940
Well, I've done stuff on this on my show where, you know, look,

645
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,060
even your appliances that don't appear, you know,

646
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,980
that you don't even think of them as having computer chips are communicating

647
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,440
on a different part of the Web.

648
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,940
Indeed, you know, not not one that's even visual that you can watch yourself.

649
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,440
Yeah. Yeah. And it's all.

650
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,800
In other words, it's in the it's it's built in. Right.

651
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,040
It doesn't have to be programmed like your refrigerator

652
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,260
literally has a computer chip in it that communicates your your air conditioner.

653
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,020
You're I mean, I'm talking all the appliances

654
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,600
that you can name around the house communicate on on this on that Cisco system.

655
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,440
Yeah, I kind of I have a mini split.

656
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,260
I installed a Mr.

657
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,679
Cool and you could do an Internet hookup so I could be away from the house

658
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,560
and turn the heat on or on or off. Right.

659
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,199
Yeah, I kind of like that idea.

660
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:36,500
It's kind of like I worked with someone who was a trustee of the John Arava's

661
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,699
trust. I don't most here's a name that people don't know.

662
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,420
John Arava, he there might be actually YouTube video

663
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,020
that's like 12 years old or 15 years old of him talking about magnetite and

664
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
or AVA.

665
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,560
He came up with the smart home designs in the 1960s. Right.

666
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,160
And also stealth paint,

667
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,780
which I do have here, by the way, and the formula and all the stuff to make it.

668
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,440
That's why, if you remember back in the early 2000s,

669
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,780
Israel was not concerned about getting stealth planes in the late 90s

670
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,900
because they had this paint.

671
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,360
They could just paint the old F-14s and F-16s,

672
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,180
and they were just as stealthy as the cell. Right.

673
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,640
So that came from him.

674
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,020
Anyway, there's a name that no one hears about.

675
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,000
And on Arava. That's true.

676
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,320
But that feature that you that you can access is one thing.

677
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,480
But it but through the features like that, I'm telling you,

678
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,440
they have secret features that literally could tell

679
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,460
like everything you put in the refrigerator.

680
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,200
It can scan all the barcodes.

681
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,060
Sure. I think that has to be a smart.

682
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,400
Like if I have a fridge, it's 25 years old.

683
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,740
Probably not. Maybe.

684
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,580
Maybe because much like it does have a chip in it, though.

685
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,220
Yeah. Like much like I learned about the cars that, you know, like I didn't realize.

686
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,540
And I found out about this from a mechanic who pulled one out one time

687
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,340
is that, you know, cars in the 70s, some of them had those chips in them already

688
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,280
that today, you know, like they have the integrated computer.

689
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,940
Everybody knows all the cars have a computer in them, all of that.

690
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,880
But in the 70s, they had them and they just weren't as sophisticated.

691
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,160
But you could have like a Le Mans from 78 or whatever.

692
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,200
And which they don't make those cars.

693
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,780
So it's trackable. Yeah.

694
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,620
But it's always it's always been trackable, which is funny.

695
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,920
Because cars that you that you buy at the used car lots on,

696
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
you know, no credit check or whatever,

697
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,140
they find they always find you because they've got the chips in them. Right.

698
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,720
Right. Exactly.

699
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,620
And that's that's the funny part about it.

700
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
But but they track everything, though.

701
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,880
They know how much you you use your your air conditioning.

702
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,060
They know how often it's on. They know how.

703
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,920
Sure. Well, it doesn't matter if they know what they want to know

704
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,300
is how much data they can gather and how can they sell it?

705
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,900
Well, all of those data types.

706
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,900
Yeah. Good.

707
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,420
I want to tie this back to the industry thing, because people don't see that

708
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,680
as substance, what they don't see their behavior and everything that they say

709
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,780
and do and interact with is being is being used as currency.

710
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
They don't know that most most people are aware of something like that,

711
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,180
but they don't understand the value of because there was a

712
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,540
there was a person to help you say this. Maybe we'll end it here.

713
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,620
There was a

714
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,940
interview that I watched late night on cable back in the 90s.

715
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,300
One of the top credit card guys like let's just give a like the CEO

716
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,420
of MasterCard. Right.

717
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,740
And he and he's like, you know, most people who use credit cards

718
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,900
don't know how they work at all.

719
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,700
But if you know how it works and you're still using a credit card, you're an idiot.

720
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,160
And this is coming from the top.

721
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,360
That's kind of like the CEO of McDonald's.

722
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,620
You know, I don't eat McDonald's.

723
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,520
I eat that crap. Right.

724
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,780
Which I think happened at one point, too, by the way.

725
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,440
One of those. Yeah.

726
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,960
He got his order for his stocks dropped a couple of points when he said that.

727
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,080
Right. That's when the guy some guy did a documentary

728
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,140
about eating McDonald's only for a month or two.

729
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,960
And he went he kept getting medical checkups and his health was dwindling.

730
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,340
Oh, it was a supersize supersize me.

731
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,080
Yeah. Spurlock.

732
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Yeah. That was a while back, too.

733
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,460
So, yeah, people don't know.

734
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
I don't think they care enough.

735
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,380
But if they just cared a little bit and made some changes, just lasting

736
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,940
changes that went through some personal austerity just for three days,

737
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,200
didn't use these things.

738
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,040
It would it would be enough to shake the system to its core.

739
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Oh, yeah. Much like that whole you've heard it over and over again

740
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,640
over the years about don't buy gas on this particular day. Right.

741
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,060
Yeah, that's it.

742
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
It never works.

743
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,240
But if people did it for like a couple of days and also did.

744
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,200
Oh, massive.

745
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,260
They don't understand the power that they have. Yeah. Right.

746
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,460
Because that's the thing.

747
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,340
And that's the thing about this information, I think, is it's about the flow

748
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,940
of the information more than it is the information itself,

749
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,700
because it was about maybe seven, eight years ago.

750
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,220
They had one of those massive, you know, economic forums.

751
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,620
And the main speaker came out and said, you know what?

752
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,260
We don't need to worry about oil anymore.

753
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,780
Oil is not the big moneymaker.

754
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,640
The new oil is information. It's data.

755
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,920
Yeah, it's data, not even information, just data.

756
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,860
I think there's a difference.

757
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,400
Yeah, I think there is, too.

758
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,780
But that's the way he presented it at that forum or whatever.

759
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,820
You know, he said it's the information economy.

760
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,820
I think they called it or something like that.

761
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,520
And and then he led into it.

762
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,660
But the main thing was, yeah, the key was data.
