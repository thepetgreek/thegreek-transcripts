1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,480
Rated Y Sonic Event 94 and here we are. Greek, how are you doing?

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm doing all right. I did some sleep therapy today, about seven hours of sleep. I highly

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,920
recommend that, by the way. You know, the reason I brought it up is, you know, people go to

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,720
the gym to build muscle. You know, I ran into someone, we called him The Rock. And actually,

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,580
I can mention him because he passed away. Michael Labasso, he was a childhood friend and he

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:43,600
worked for the DEA. He looked like The Rock. And he passed away in 2001. Tragic accident.

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,840
And he was the kind of guy that was thin, you know, just nondescript, bookworm looking.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,640
And then one year later, I saw him and he looked like The Rock. He said, what the hell?

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,820
Right. It's around 16 years old or 17. Right. All of a sudden, his neck is almost as big

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,800
around as his head. Well, well, yeah. Well, no, no. Actually, he looked like a small Arnold

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,380
Schwarzenegger. Didn't quite have the pictorial size, the chest size. But what I see is going

12
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:20,820
to the gym. Right. We used to go to Bath Beach Bodybuilding in. OK, so late 70s. We're talking

13
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,460
now and never had a reaction like that, but basically lived in the gym. You got a part

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,880
time job there. And part of the barter was to be in the gym all the time. And he just

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,320
turned into a monster bodybuilder in one year. Now, bringing this story, most people say

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,180
that happens because you go to the gym. No, it happens because you rest. You don't you

17
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:47,300
don't build muscle in the gym. You build muscle when you're sleeping. Think about that. They

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,200
used to tell us as kids, that's when our bones grow. Right. That's what they would

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,100
tell us. I don't know about everything. Everything. Your hair. I mean, growth happens when you're

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,220
sleeping, when you're. Yeah. OK, so why do I bring this up? I want to underscore it because

21
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,340
you never hear that. You know, I've been training. That's why I'm strong. No, you're if you trained

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,759
it in sleep. Well, you wouldn't be strong. You would actually deteriorate. There's something

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,100
called Epstein Barr. I remember when I was training for cycling intensively and getting

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,840
like flu symptoms in the middle of the summer, everyone was training with. It's when you

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,240
overtrain. Right. You'd say you exhibit breakdown more than buildup. We came in one day as you

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,820
have Epstein Barr. I'm like, oh, my gosh, the names of these diseases. But anyway, our

27
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,200
conditions. So I just want to bring that up. It's important whenever you're developing the

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,720
body or healing the body. It doesn't happen in your waking hours, by the way. By the way,

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:49,240
you know, it's like certain ailments can happen overnight, you know, so and same way. So I just

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,380
wanted to emphasize that, that whenever there is any recovery of the body, even like healing of

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,420
when I was younger and had a really good diet, I would get a cut or a scratch or a bruise and it

32
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,740
would heal in two days. I mean, almost completely right. That was because of when you when you

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,780
slept, not when you were walking around. So I just want to bring that up. It's it's quite a quite

34
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,900
a thing that's not really, let's just say, cherished in this society. Right. They're always

35
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,080
looking for remedies and things like that. I had by the way, I had much more remarkable skin when I

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,420
was younger. My stuff would heal up like even faster than that. And I always attributed to water

37
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,820
actually my water intake because I would take in best quality water I could find. And I did it in

38
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,020
a controlled way. And I was always very conscious of hydration. And I thought this was best

39
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:46,300
methodology for me. Sure. And Dr. Batman. Other people. Dr. Batman. Yeah. Other people would say,

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,960
oh, it's your genetics. You know, you have this skin because I would get cut or something and

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,940
it would be the kind of thing that should leave a scar. You know, there's a you have you heard of

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,740
Dr. Batman. Batman. Yes. They call him Dr. Batman. Right. And he's you're not sick. You're thirsty

43
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,620
is his book. It's not that great of a book. He was in prison and a political prisoner in Iran.

44
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,160
And he was healing people with, you know, accessing water at the in the prison. And when

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,600
it was sentence was over, he says, No, I got more work to do here. Right? Anyway, that kind of guy.

46
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,340
So yeah, it's an okay read. But it'll just make you aware of other things. He uses a lot of stuff

47
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,820
that you know, is not true. You know, the medical speaking of not true there, by the way, YouTube

48
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,700
thing popped up and I clicked on it was a medical doctor critiquing all of McDonald's food and

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,320
ingredients. And I wanted to critique him because this will give you diabetes or high blood pressure.

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,380
Oh my gosh, you know, it's good for me to watch that because I get spoiled in my own

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,080
thinking in my own mind about seeing how they're perpetrating a fiction. But when you have a

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,180
doctor getting a million views on YouTube, because everyone likes you know, that he's brought up you

53
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,860
get diabetes or certain ailments that are medical fictions. Everyone approves there was no one in

54
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,120
those 2000 comments. I didn't go through all of them. I what I do is I hit on the comment selection

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,580
newest first, right and the right to go through and no one mentioned that his stuff was basically

56
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,260
perpetrating medical fictions just basically would damage the liver. But he was calling it all these

57
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,060
other things, especially blood pressure doesn't understand. So I mean, this is the state that

58
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,920
we're in. It's not very good. Which by the way, speaking of very good, got quite a few bit

59
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,960
feedback from reading on the multiple sundry of questions on that email on the last sonic

60
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,480
92, which even though this is 94, ha ha. We did a little slip up there, folks. So you're not going

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,120
crazy. You know what, they're all in order. And it makes sense. It's just the date is now out of

62
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
order. And so how about that? Yeah, you're out of order. Yeah, it was a movie with Pacino. Was it

63
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,920
in there? Or was it no somebody else? This place? No courts out of order. And yeah, it was the

64
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,960
chamber. It was not that bad. But yeah, we call it in a date thing. But yeah, just there's one more

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,300
question that I left out. That seems to be a proprietary. So what did you think of reading

66
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,720
the what we were on there for about an hour? I think I'm just reading emails. Yeah, that was

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,800
just about an hour. Just a question and answer there. Or email one email, one email, but question

68
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,460
and answer question and answer. Matter of fact, before you get to this email question, I actually

69
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,260
have one that I forgot to get to a while ago from somebody who sent me some material again this week,

70
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,780
and they never bothered to mention it again. But you just reminded me about blood pressure, which

71
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,220
is is a funny thing. Look, they have an instrument, they use it. Obviously, it measures something.

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,380
So the person wanted to know what in reality are they measuring? Good. I always bring I used to use

73
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,340
the technical terms, but the heart, they measure the beat. First of all, their entire theory that

74
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,860
the heart is a pump is wrong. So anything that comes out from them, because they have a false

75
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,760
theory will also be false, right? There's a maximum on that false theory. Anything that is produced

76
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,540
or emanates from that false theory must also be false, right? It's it's the point between when one

77
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,740
heartbeat, kind of like where the heartbeat hits, and then it relaxes. And then right before it

78
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:21,960
starts again, right? They have terms for that. And yeah, that's what basically they're measuring.

79
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,300
I mean, it couldn't be any more fallacious, right? Because they don't understand that the heart is not

80
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,680
even beating what you're actually hearing is all the heart is doing is contracting. And what you're

81
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,780
hearing and feeling is the stop of water pressure, kind of like a water hammer, you know, when you

82
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,220
shut off abruptly in the house, flowing water, you hear the pipes in the wall rattle a little bit,

83
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,240
because of the momentum. Yeah, it's not even beating. So there's so many ways that it's false.

84
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,560
Well, okay, here's another way to answer it indirectly. dementia and forms of Alzheimer's are

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,620
now considered so they'll emphasize dementia and Alzheimer's are not the same. That comes from

86
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,280
aluminum, usually, because it shuts down the electric brain. But they're telling they're

87
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,140
telling people now that's you have type three diabetes. Oh, my gosh. Oh, and by the way,

88
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,840
bring up that term. Diabetes just means you've you've pissed frequently, frequent urination.

89
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,580
And if you look that up, that's, that's what it means, which is now it's been changed to Mina.

90
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Oh, my gosh. That's kind of like, you know, the World Trade Center being vaporized. It's been

91
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,200
changed into jet fuel fire, right? So it's but that is, in other words, why do I bring that up?

92
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,299
I used to bring up the world, even with biblical stuff, the World Trade Center analogy, because

93
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,600
it's a perfect example of how something that is so big, you know, that everyone knows about have

94
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,440
found out about is a lie. Right? And they still get away with it. So yeah, I haven't found anything

95
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,080
in the medical community. That is true, other than the tracking and monitoring and let's say

96
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,720
effects of their medicines, which are drugs, pharmaceuticals, which mean poison, by the way.

97
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,740
When I say tracking, I mean, not what they tell you on television and the idiot that's prescribing

98
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,260
them. But when you get these prescriptions, they they have this thing called a cut or catalog cut

99
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,120
or a cut, it has the all of the side effects written on it, right, right. And it's extremely

100
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,880
fine. It's like one point font. And none of them do anything beneficial at all. The only medical

101
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,540
medical stuff that works is the nerve suppression, right, the opioid based stuff, which is old,

102
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,620
by the way, you know, in the military medic medics, that's what they rely on. And if you study,

103
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,560
I'm really flying on a big tangent here. But most people died from trauma, not from

104
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,860
the actual right shock. Right. So if you could prevent someone from going to shock by sedating

105
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,520
them and or pain relief, that's the first thing. By the way, if you go into a medical tent

106
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,300
during battle, the first thing they ask you, oh, even a hospital, someone in trauma and I see

107
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,320
first day they ask you is do you want morphine? Right? You want morphine? And then they can write,

108
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,520
they look at you, do you want morphine? And what does everyone say? Usually? Yeah. So it doesn't

109
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,940
always work. So okay. It's all fiction, but it's so powerful. Right? Just like 911. If you tell

110
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,160
people there was no it was not a it was actually 911 was a terrorist event, by the way. Think about

111
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,840
it. Right. So just like COVID was a terrorist event. So it's a terrorist event is a terrorist

112
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,320
event to bring terror. It doesn't matter who's perpetrating it, or whether they're telling you

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,320
is perpetrating it. That's pretty much true. Right. But anything else beyond that is, is not

114
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,900
true. So the same thing with the medical system, if you're not well, they can maybe determine that

115
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,660
to a certain degree, not usually. Anything else beyond that is a lie. You know, there's perfectly

116
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,100
healthy, there was a study done where they went to places where there were centurions,

117
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,300
high percentage of centurions, people living over 100. And they measure their blood pressure

118
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,640
and blood sugar, and they would have been eligible for quadruple bypass and type two diabetes. That's

119
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,900
how these were people that were over 100 years old working in the fields totally healthy and

120
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,120
normal, right? They were diagnosed as having severe diabetes and heart conditions, right?

121
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,520
Because, you know, they hide this data very use exclusion. You know, they'll study 2000 people

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,700
but give you the results of 10 that only comply with what they want. Like 911. Right? Again,

123
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,480
same thing. This is a I use I used to use 911 for a while I got kind of tired because it sounded like

124
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,240
I was one of those 911 whatever's right, whatever you want to call them. They're also JFK, whatever

125
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,780
still, haha. Not disparaging you. But, you know, because most of the JFK stuff is kind of like

126
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,680
they find something they can't it could be baseless, but they spin it off like it is,

127
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,700
you know what I mean? So same with 911. So if you stick to using it as a metaphor,

128
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,640
it works really well in the mind once you understand what really happens. By the way,

129
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,300
I was having a discussion recently with someone about JFK, talk about super tangent from blood

130
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,740
pressure. And this person knows his family is in intelligence. And what's interesting,

131
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,900
they're older, by the way, they're older than us. What's interesting is it's kind of kind of

132
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,160
like what I say when someone says they're in the military, which military are you in? Like, you

133
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,360
know, the one that everyone knows about that they, you know, be the best you can be on TV or the real

134
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,180
the other military. So this person knew was in the regular, let's say one of the intelligence

135
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:42,760
agencies, I won't mention CIA. And they knew about the other side, right? And they said,

136
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,660
no one really knows about JFK is interesting thing kicked around is no one really knows,

137
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,900
because before it happened, they knew something was going to happen. But it was only in rumor.

138
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,440
I didn't get into it very much. So in other words, the internal memos,

139
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,680
was there's a rumor going around, right? Yeah, this is going to happen. But no specifics,

140
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
right? There's plenty of those. Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. Based on your research?

141
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,600
Absolutely. I could I could probably get 100 of those together for you. No problem.

142
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,940
Yeah. But you see, let's go use same with 911. Right? Like one of the rumors in 911 was

143
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,600
that Osama bin Laden put suitcase nukes in the building. And that's what brought them down. Well,

144
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,580
we know that can't be true. Because an atmospheric explosion is an atmospheric explosion

145
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:34,420
would look like Hiroshima, flashbang, you know. Anyway, blood pressure, all that stuff.

146
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,980
I used to use restless leg syndrome. They had drugs for that, right? In the early 2000s. As an

147
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,180
example. I recently spoke to someone again, who's in a retirement community and says there's mostly

148
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,360
doctors here. And I got no one to talk to because they're so stupid. Think about that for a moment.

149
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,880
Right? You know, and you're going Yeah, no. Why? Because they're part of the legal system.

150
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,220
It's kind of like if you don't show up to school, if you have a letter from your mom, it's okay.

151
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,620
In the legal system, if you have a letter from a doctor, you can get away with right? Of course,

152
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,920
you get it. It's part of the legal system has nothing to do for people say, you know, go to

153
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,320
a doctor or the doctor like there's the doctor, right? Yeah. That's like a lot like the God,

154
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:29,280
you know, Allah means the God. Allah means the and Allah. If you read in Aramaic, e, l, a, h is

155
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,160
God is now becomes a personified figure. These doctors are personified figures of authority,

156
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,900
but really, they're part of the legal system. So the last Do you want some scumbag attorney to tell

157
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,080
you what's going on with your body? Oh, my gosh, hell no. And when I say scumbag attorney, you

158
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,840
would have to be a scumbag attorney to actually be part of the underpinning of a system like that.

159
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Which also, when I was bike racing, I was on a stage race once. And so what do you do? He says,

160
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm an attorney. So what do you do? He says, I edit medical books. What?

161
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,680
There's an answer. Yeah. Any questions? Right? Any questions? No, not at all. That's the guy

162
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,860
who's actually honest about his job, though. I mean, most of us sit there and they well,

163
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,980
I actually I pursue this and I pursue that. He wasn't a scumbag. But he did what he did was

164
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:28,000
scumbag. Gary, let's quotes many used to use that often. Yeah. So anyway, the question in short,

165
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,580
it's about a paragraph. A young person in their 20s are diagnosed with an osteoporosis. Soft

166
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,880
bones were actually their bones were breaking and fracturing. What do you do about that? What

167
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,040
do you think, Chuck? What do you think about that? From based on our past calls? Put you on the spot.

168
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,220
Actually, that's not put you on the spot. You think we could apply Yin and Yang to that?

169
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, obviously, you'd have to because, look, the bones are supposed to be young.

170
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,880
Right. Which means that you have to apply some energy to them in order to get that condition

171
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,640
in order to make them young. But apparently it's going the other direction. So

172
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,500
I would try and figure out what to do. Yeah. Two things. Now, if everyone in his geographical

173
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,040
vicinity came down with something simple, you got hit with a radiological weapon of

174
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,680
some advanced type. Right. That would that would not damage the skin,

175
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,380
but go straight to the bones. Right. Also, if there were more than one person in that geographical area

176
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
that that happened, then you would have more, quote, unquote, specimens. Right.

177
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,720
To investigate. Well, you mentioned something like that. That would have been a big plus

178
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,700
if you did. He didn't. So I'm presuming he's the only one. We have to go another track.

179
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
If you don't have a cluster, then you don't have an environmental event. So.

180
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,380
Yeah. But it's still it could be environmental. But in inverse, his body's protection to that

181
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,820
natural radiation came down. Well, environmental could also mean that it's more of a limited

182
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,760
situation, like the environment of, say, just their dwelling. Right. So maybe. Yeah. But he

183
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,540
didn't mention anything like that. So we have to presume that it's highly specific just to the

184
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,480
individual. OK, fine. Right. And this would this would be part of the query. I used to work with

185
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,660
people that treated people, doctors and other sorts, and they would bring cases to me years ago,

186
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,319
years ago, like five, six, seven, ten years ago. And when they bring the case to me,

187
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,780
I would start asking all these questions. And they were like, oh, we're going to I'm going to

188
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,200
have to get back to you because I didn't ask those questions. Yeah, of course not. Because

189
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,720
a week later, they wouldn't check out what's going on in the neighborhood. They wouldn't check out,

190
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,920
you know, is anybody else in the house experiencing this? Right. Well, it's so

191
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,240
right. So, you know, same with cancers. You know, you'll have one person. There was a person that

192
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,780
was a urologist in Chicago. His wife told me is he's he has some form of liver cancer and

193
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,020
they eat well and live as if he needs to sleep somewhere else because there's some

194
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,880
something coming up through the earth, slicing, cutting through his body that he's susceptible

195
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,880
to. And he actually slept in another room and got better. That's a long another. This is back

196
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,180
2015 is, let's say, a few years ago. But 2015 is not a few years ago. It's nine years ago, right?

197
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:19,380
Yeah. So in this case, we have like, for example, you know, if you have a pickup bed,

198
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,420
a pickup truck, you're collecting cosmic when if the bed is not covered,

199
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,960
you're collecting cosmic dust. Right. It's just very fine. You can't see it. But if you search

200
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,740
hard enough, you'll find something unusual that's falling. Right. So you don't notice it. So these

201
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,480
things that we don't notice that we're bombarded with constantly natural radiation and unnatural

202
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,300
man induced. Our bodies have, quote unquote, natural protection or compensation for it.

203
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,280
So in this individual, what happened is that natural compensation

204
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:02,220
collapsed. Right. And it was either. Well, all chemicals have carriers for vitality and energy.

205
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,020
So it was either his intake or it was something in his genetic hereditary code or something. His

206
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,820
body just decided, hey, I'm going to release this energy and, you know, subject this person or

207
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,280
subject myself now to it. You know what, consciously or unconsciously, because the body also has its

208
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:28,580
own mind. So we the only thing I can do is apply Yin and Yang to that and remedies for that.

209
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Now, the person is recovered. So so in the email showed that he says that he's recovered from it.

210
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,060
He actually does heavy labor. So what I would suggest is there's really nothing you can do

211
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:47,180
for something like that when your own body decides to crap out on something. Right. What can you do?

212
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,960
Well, it's the Yin and Yang works really well. You could assist it, you know, just like if you

213
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,260
have a burn, you put something cool on it, not too cold, but or cold, but not, you know, free to call

214
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,240
because you can the body can interpret that as a burn again. So there's not much. It's just one of

215
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,580
the realities of being here. And it sounds like I don't have an answer for this. But the answer is

216
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,060
if it's something very specific to the person, they just go along with it,

217
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:21,520
and the person obviously survived. But the Yin and Yang may not work in a case like that,

218
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,260
where the body's mind releases its ability to protect itself. And what I mean by that also

219
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,780
is I think early on on the Sonics, I gave an example of how does that apply, though?

220
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,680
How does that apply to this this weak bone situation? You know, as far as.

221
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,060
I guess it does it. It's very OK. Could not only be weak bone, it could be eyesight.

222
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,360
Well, I was thinking that was another question. I was looking for that email. What do you do to

223
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:55,300
improve eyesight? I'll get into that maybe as a as a as a diversion, but a slight diversion,

224
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,320
because I have no answer for that. If you're the only person now back anyway, regarding the bones,

225
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,040
a very simple approximation that I've done on what could be good for bones is tarot root,

226
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,240
the large tarot, not the small tarot. I don't know how many times to say that.

227
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,960
It doesn't seem like people get it like they walk through the shop, let's say an Asian market,

228
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,840
and they see tarot and root and they stop thinking. Their brain goes blank. There's two

229
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,720
types of tarot, large and small, and they're not the same at all. Right. It's not like you

230
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,460
have big bananas and so it's kind of like plantains and bananas. You've had plantains,

231
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,380
it's nothing like a banana. Yeah. You would expect everybody's got that. Yeah. Everybody's

232
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,340
got that weird idea that it's it's the same thing and it's really not. It's really. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,280
Yeah. It's not at all. Yeah. So so tarot, I had some slices that I left out and dried on a

234
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,860
windowsill and it was hard like plaster. When I say hard like plaster, indiscernible from plaster.

235
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,320
If you write, you know, like those plaster vases, almost like a rock, almost like a rock.

236
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,100
But, yeah, I gotcha. Yeah. So very much like the fiber in bones. And by the way,

237
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:12,660
bones are a collection of fibers like fascis, you know, the bundle of sticks. Right. Right. It's

238
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,420
very much like that. And the reason why it's like that is because of the piezoelectric nature.

239
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,460
Let's just use that loosely when you're walking and moving and the bone accepts a force, it creates

240
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,420
a slight charge, electrical charge. One way to actually do therapy for people that are bedridden,

241
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,380
if you spend enough time in bed, you can't walk regardless if you're injured or not. Right.

242
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,240
Your body. Right. So so if someone is in that condition, usually elderly people,

243
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,840
let's say someone gets a knee replacement or a hip replacement, double knee, double hip,

244
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,160
they're going to have problems adjusting for a few days or weeks. What you do is you go and get

245
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,800
yourself what is it? Table tennis paddles. They're small wooden paddles with rubber coating on them.

246
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:03,240
Perfect. Yeah, they're perfect for this every day for about just a few minutes with an hour,

247
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,660
a few hours interval in between as many times as you can during the day. Use that little paddle to

248
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,580
tap the bottoms of their feet, the entire heel from the toes to the heel for a few minutes at

249
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,320
a time might be uncomfortable in the beginning. Just tap, not hit, not spanking. Right. But but

250
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,920
tapping with intervals and that will be the equivalent of walking for a short distance

251
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,860
electrically and, you know, energetically. And the person, when it comes time to do their therapy,

252
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,060
they'll just get up and walk right across the room and they're like,

253
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:45,760
you're charging me five hundred dollars an hour for what you get it. So it's it's just wanted to

254
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,020
throw that in because it's bone related. So what really to weaken the bones, it's you know,

255
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,860
when you have a bundle of sticks that is very strong, when you release the tie that holds or

256
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:03,640
the tire that holds the bundle together, they become very weak. Right. So it's so again,

257
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,380
just to continue on that without much of a diversion, which I'd like to put in because I

258
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,540
have no answer, is that the tire or the tie that holds the bundle together is really what came

259
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,600
loose, which is also young, but it has a yin quality because it wraps around the entire bundle.

260
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:26,540
Right. So the person also asked about I say, how do you improve? I said the best example I can give

261
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,480
for that is this. I worked with someone on television and they were doing productions.

262
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,980
This is about 15, 18 years ago, and they showed me some videos of themselves 10 years, 15 years

263
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,960
prior to this, and they were wearing glasses. And now at that point, at the current time,

264
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,500
they were not wearing glasses. And they say, why were you wearing? You're not wearing glasses. Now

265
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,180
you're wearing condoms. No, I don't need them anymore. But you were wearing them back then.

266
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,320
And he says, yes, is that I improved my eyesight. I said, well, how did you do that?

267
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,660
Improved my diet and less stress. Stop worrying about stuff. In other words, give a shit factor

268
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,360
goes down. Right. And improve your diet. What is the easiest way to improve your diet? Avoid

269
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,980
processed foods. When you do not eat foods that are processed, you eat more whole foods that are

270
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,140
balanced and have more nutrition, yada, yada, yada. You could take that however you want. Right.

271
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,680
So that's the simplest thing. Like, in other words, if you're buying food for your home or your house

272
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,460
or yourself or others, and it has a label on it, it's been processed in some way.

273
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,560
And the bigger the label, the more processing, right? Right. And ingredients.

274
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,580
Longer label, really, because you ever notice you go to Walmart and buy like a

275
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,080
doughnut and you look at the back ingredients and it's like two paragraphs long of one font

276
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,360
letters. Right. It's like, wait a second. Just doughnuts, yeast, flour, salt, sugar.

277
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,440
That's it. You think most it should be half a dozen ingredients. Right. I mean,

278
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,860
if they use egg in there, let's say. Yeah. Not thirty five. So. Right. Yeah.

279
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,720
That would not be good. So that is a simple thing. And then, of course,

280
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,640
is seasonality. And if it's not. But here's the default. You're ready. If it's not heavily

281
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,840
processed, which are big constituents are preservatives and other things like the anti

282
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,060
spoilage, whatever, it's going to be seasonal. Why? Because it's not going to last that long.

283
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,980
Yeah. So we'll be more. The chances of it being seasonal is higher also,

284
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,060
and save for hydroponics because hydroponics, you know, they grow them all year round, mostly

285
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,460
and geography or whatever. You know, if it's not geographic. Right.

286
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,940
You can play with that. Like I do tropical fruit here from other parts of the world

287
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,560
in the summer, thinking that it will cool me down. It kind of works a little bit, but not

288
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,140
well, because those things not being able to be grown here trumps the ability for them to cool me

289
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:05,400
down. So, again, it's a it's a tricky thing. And what happens is when you stop eating locally,

290
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,840
that you stop developing ways and methodologies to make food more interesting. Right. You rely

291
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:18,480
on food from whatever. What is it like in England? The national food for a while was chicken marsala

292
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:27,480
or something. Or chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken marsala or chicken marsala is another

293
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,080
one. No, it's the chicken tiki. It's an Indian dish. Indian. In other words, Indian food is the

294
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,920
national dish of England. Right. It kind of makes sense when you understand the conquest of it and

295
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,900
the political and how, you know, you won't see too many restaurants. Let's go to this English

296
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,100
restaurant. No, no. For years and years. As a matter of fact, for years and years, anytime I

297
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,480
would talk to somebody from over there, they would just say something that struck me as strange.

298
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,240
I'm going to go get curry. Yeah. And I go curry. What curry is curry to me is a spice. You know,

299
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,820
what do you mean? Curry was a mixture of spices, actually. We've gotten used to it. It's usually a

300
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,160
turmeric based yellow. Well, yeah, but it doesn't sound like something that you would get as a dish.

301
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,220
You see what I'm saying? It's like, OK, if you tell me you're going to get. Yeah, but what I

302
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,960
mean is foreign to them in England, they would have from the meat and any meat you could make

303
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,380
some of the cows, the best cows we have here come from New Jersey and all that come from England.

304
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,680
And then they have they're known for their Cotswold or lambs and sheep. But it's almost

305
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,720
like saying, you know, what are you going to eat for dinner tonight, Greek? And you said, well,

306
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,440
pepper, you know, I'd go. Oh, I mean, it's not very good. Yeah. Well, here's another thing.

307
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,460
You go to a place like In-N-Out Burger. Right. And they tout that they're they're French fries.

308
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm putting in air quotes. This is what I want to talk about, really, about them, really,

309
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,620
because it's an issue. They cut their potatoes fresh and right away, fry them. Those are not

310
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,720
French fries. Those are just fried potatoes in order for them to be French fries. They have to

311
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,580
be parboiled, cooled down, par fried and then finished fried. They don't do that. So they're

312
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,960
not French fries. They're just fried potatoes. And I brought the issue up with several people.

313
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,860
Of course, you know what? I get the fluoride stare. Yeah, of course. No French fries at a

314
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,340
bare minimum. You got to take them and soak them in water and parboil them at a bare minimum to

315
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,260
make French fries and fries. Yeah. And then they're par fried, cooled down and then finished

316
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,700
fried. And that's how you get a French fry. If you're just freshly peeling potatoes and cutting

317
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,460
them in whatever shape and then frying them and serving them, those are just fried potatoes.

318
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah. So they don't understand that. Yeah. Nothing wrong with it. But I mean,

319
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,580
you go to the boardwalk and the guy says there is something wrong with it. There is not very good.

320
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,460
Well, no, I'm not saying if you if you don't care about it, you know what I mean? If you don't care

321
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,240
about quality, what I'm saying is that's the way you want to eat them. Great. Enjoy. But what I'm

322
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,580
saying is that, you know, they do this on the board. You remember on the boardwalks, they used

323
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,900
to do this. Some places would go. We have French, you know, we have fresh fries. Right. And they

324
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,280
would do that right there on the boardwalk. They would cut up potatoes, right? Yeah. Fresh fries

325
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,400
is correct. That would be it. But they're not French fries. Right. Right. And they would be,

326
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,800
you know, we got fresh fries and people go, OK, I'm going to take some French fries.

327
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,560
So the people would order it. So, yeah, it's the way we use language like diabetes. You know,

328
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:25,300
diabetes is frequent urination has nothing to do with it. Yeah, it's pretty, pretty

329
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,240
it's all diversions. Yeah, it's all diversions. But anyway, yeah, that's that's pretty much

330
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,100
just what I just I want to thank everyone who listened to the last thought I can give feedback

331
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,400
regarding the they enjoyed going through the multiple questions and all that. But, yeah,

332
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,540
I guess tonight or today is pretty simple. I don't have much for you other than what I've

333
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:51,060
brought up. Well, look, I got one last thing to throw in, because, you know, more on this thing

334
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,540
with the bones just for a moment, because you were going to talk about how younger people

335
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,300
ended up with, you know, with some of these diseases. And I've taken note of this lately.

336
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,660
Oh, yeah. The body gives up. Yeah. Yeah. But but the trend now, it seems as though, OK,

337
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,400
the stuff that we used to hear about when somebody was 60, 70, 80. Right. A lot of people

338
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,660
are getting that at 40. And you mentioned dementia earlier. Dementia has become what

339
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,940
that dementia could start at a young age, like a pre adolescence. Oh, yeah, absolutely. But the

340
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,080
thing is, it used to be a lot more rare, it seems for somebody to be in their 40s.

341
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,240
Environmental stresses with toxins in the environment and bad habits all around.

342
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,300
Yeah. But do you think it's just environmental and bad habits or do you think it's all the

343
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,320
medical community is promoting that? Right. They're not your friends. Right.

344
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,500
Well, of course, they're creating the toxins. They're part of the military industrial company.

345
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,180
In other words, who's the head of the doctors, the surgeon general? He's always in uniform.

346
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,740
1952 to 54, they decided propaganda and to keep control of the population through the medical

347
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,840
system. Right. So they got the military branch to do that. The medical is under the military.

348
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,680
Right. So the surgeon general is always in uniform. Yeah. And then simultaneously,

349
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,820
the joke becomes what? Go ahead and eat what, 20 White Castles and smoke a cigarette. That's

350
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,080
healthy dinner for you. Right. Well, it can be. It depends on the yeah, it depends on

351
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,220
many other factors. It's never that simple. But again, a young person, the way you would

352
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,680
approach any health issue is loss of biological vacuum. The higher the vacuum,

353
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:38,420
the biological vacuum, the more robust the individual. Right. And then maybe we'll just

354
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,460
get into improving biological vacuum. I'd have to think about that because it's full of nuances.

355
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,520
Right. So it's not just putting pressure on something. Yeah. I think in one of the sonics

356
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,380
we talked about some things don't need pressure if the body's trying to release them. Right.

357
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,400
Right. Right. So I guess it would be a proper. How do you how do you maintain the tightness of

358
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,880
your body basically? Right. No, no. The biological vacuum is internal in the cell structure. When

359
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,320
the cells group together. What do they call it, synchronized swimming or how you ever see how a

360
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,220
flock of birds can sometimes change direction in mid direction, you know, and there's no collisions.

361
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,020
Right. Large. I think the robins are famous for this. You could have like 20,000 robins flying

362
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,980
in a swarm. It looks like from a distance it looks like a black swarm and they just move so

363
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,520
fluidly. Right. Or how does a swarm of bats, you know, come flying at you and they're a little

364
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,600
more a little less graceful. But they do it eloquently. They're all in sync like a school

365
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,040
of fish. You ever see these video old Wild Kingdom and National Geographic, the swarm of fish,

366
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,360
and they just move beautifully like one body. But that's why I was with bats that appear more

367
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,200
clunky and everything else. You notice something. Bats usually don't collide with one another,

368
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,140
even though it looks like absolute chaos when they all go. Well, it's usually when they're

369
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,500
leaving the cave. Yeah. But but what I'm trying to say is that that's synchronous,

370
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,560
synchronous because the body is everything working together. That can only happen when it's immersed

371
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,540
or the prevailing condition is a good biological vacuum, which is

372
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,520
just what it sounds like, a negative pressure. So there's many ways to do that,

373
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,780
to improve that. And I think when we started off tonight is what I started off with sleep.

374
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,900
Right. So well, hey, look, we could always call that one proper vacuum maintenance.
