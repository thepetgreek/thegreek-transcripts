1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,700
Rated Y, number 95, and here we are, Greek, how are you doing?

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,420
Oh, I'm doing, doing as I'm swallowing a big gulp of coffee and lit a cigarette, yeah.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Usually I'm better at that timing, I usually know and give you a minute to breathe before

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,180
I ask you a question, but that was a bad timing on my part.

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,580
No, it's fine, I got caught out here with Daylight Savings, which I kind of knew,

6
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,860
someone asked me to meet them on Skype the other day, and they gave me the time,

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,580
and I looked at the time on the Pacific coast, and it was the same as Tucson, so

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,740
I was like, oh, okay, it's happened already. I once missed a bus trip

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,380
because of the Daylight Savings. Sunday morning, we were supposed to meet up,

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,260
go somewhere, and I go there, and no one was there, and it was back in the days of payphones,

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,960
and I was like, I only have one phone number, but that person is not the one to call,

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,580
so the person I needed to call, I didn't have, and I was looking for a payphone,

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
and I asked around for the bus. I didn't ask around for the bus, I was just wondering why

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,620
they weren't there, and then I asked around for the bus, and they're like, oh, that left an hour

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:21,460
15, 20 minutes ago. I was like, what? How is that possible? And that woke me up that changing time

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:27,600
and people's perception of time is a big deal, right? You can really miss the bus, right?

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,760
No, fair enough, and it's an odd thing, too, because Arizona, I think, is still the only

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,880
place where they don't change the clocks, even though they constantly...

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:36,980
Arkansas.

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,380
Oh, Arkansas, too?

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,380
Yeah.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,240
Oh, okay.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,780
This last time I checked, yeah, it's wartime. Basically, this was done World War I and then

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,220
definitely in World War II to increase productivity and delay, because most raids,

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,660
aerial raids, would be done at night, right?

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,340
Right, right.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,660
So they increased productivity to keep people out more and walking home during daylight,

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,980
you know, because of the natural light, let's say, and it's called wartime, and it still is,

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,280
in effect. A lot of countries, just about all the Western, what they call them, allies had it,

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,060
and most of them stopped it after the war, but the Americans did not, because you're still at war,

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,400
legally. What's going on in the state that we're in with World War II is just cessation

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,460
of hostilities. Germany has an interim government. There was never a treaty with

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,200
the legitimate German government. They went into exile, right? So you can't have a treaty

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
if you can't find the people to have a treaty with, right?

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,100
No, that's for sure.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,040
So they put an interim government in Germany. That's why one of the Olympic gold medalists

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,840
from Germany, he has a seed oil company, and whenever we talk about anything politically,

38
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,400
he says, I don't want to talk, we haven't had a government in 80 years, you know?

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,600
In other words, more educated people know this, kind of like Iraq. If you go to Iraq right now,

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,780
it's an interim government. The Iraqis don't have a government, it's an interim, you know,

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,280
puppet put in by the, right?

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah, it's been that way for quite a while. What was it, Afghanistan was the same up until

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,740
very recently.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,940
Yeah, they got, yeah, the Taliban is not what, you know, we've been propagandized that they are.

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,060
But they are, they start, are an intelligence operation. And the Americans have an interim

46
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,540
government since March the 9th, 1933. So, you know, anyway, pretty interesting.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,480
That's the receivership you talked about.

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:45,040
Yeah, yeah. And if you put in March the 9th, 1933, in a search, Google will provide you the,

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,620
it's just two paragraphs of the act that did that. And when you read it, it uses pretty simple

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,860
terms, but you got to find out what those terms mean. Right? So, you know, it's pretty interesting.

51
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,000
I mean, yeah, it's the credits. Yeah, well, you know, yeah, don't expect, I've heard someone

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,460
call the 20th century a stalled century. It's like the century where nothing really

53
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,680
was allowed to happen, right? Because when you stall something,

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,920
it implies that it's not functioning as it was intended, right? You turned, basically

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
turned it off, right?

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,899
Well, that's the funny part, because they will tell us that this was the time of change. This

57
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,140
was the time of upheaval. This was the time that the world wars happened. This was the time that,

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,380
et cetera, et cetera, right? I mean, the rise and fall of the communist block,

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
everything goes on during the 20th century. And what you're telling me is in reality,

60
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,820
nothing actually happened.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,780
Yeah, well, no, nothing much happened in terms of what you would sum up for the total of

62
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,700
happening in a century. Anything scientifically, philosophically, medically, whatever,

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,480
was already known by the late 1890s, right? And it's kind of hard for people when you say, well,

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,440
we didn't have cell phones back then. Well, actually they did have wireless. But what I'm

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,100
seeing and anything that could be known was known, right? In terms of scientific, you know,

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,660
the people, when they talk about technology, they're really, they've been misguided by the

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,400
process of miniaturization, right? Everything that's in a cell phone was around back then

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,040
in principle, right? In principle, you know, micro semiconductors, you get it, micro,

69
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,940
you know, the average cell phone has 16 billion transistors in it, right?

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,540
You know, that's with a B might be more, some of them could be up in the in the 40 to 50 billion.

71
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,980
What I mean, we're back in the days, you would need a 10 story building that took up an entire

72
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,520
block, if you can use vacuum tubes for that, right, right. But the principle is exactly the

73
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,340
same. So in principle, but when you brought up the communist capitalist, you know, the main

74
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,480
difference with that, if you study, by the way, if you study communism, none of Lenin and Marx's

75
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,040
ideals, which is use that word where have ever been implemented, by the way, fully,

76
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,980
they just say they write, they just say that they do, right? I've always said that. And I've had

77
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,680
people argue with me where I say, Look, you know what, I've read their work, and it actually has

78
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,340
not been implemented as described. So yeah, they just show you the planks of communism, which is a

79
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,720
derivation. And I said, Lenin, I didn't mean Lenin, I meant Marx and Engel. I liked Engel a

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,500
lot more. But the whole idea with communism was that each area based on its geography and culture

81
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,460
would be optimized, and there's no central government, right. But they do have a central

82
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,180
central government with centralized power, they still have a central government, but not

83
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,520
the power is not centralized. So the same thing here, like the United States of Mexico, you know,

84
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,220
Mexico is also United States, right? They just people don't call it that they just call it

85
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,440
Mexico. But politically, it's the United States of Mexico, right? I think that 28 or 26 states,

86
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,720
America is 5051. Maybe if you count a few other places, but their territories, territories,

87
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,640
which is not part of this country, but I wanted to just harken on something that people do,

88
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,240
you know, how do you define the difference between capitalism and communism? Well,

89
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,640
when it comes to the country, the I've defined capitalism before capitalism is just when you

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,680
when you can't acquire something, or if you have acquired it and stop using it, you destroy it. So

91
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,020
no one else can use it. That's capitalism. But But the difference between capitalism and communism

92
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,340
is very simple. Once you study what was implemented, it's very simple. And capitalism

93
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,060
you can make fun of the national leader, but you can't make fun of your boss.

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,280
And communism, you can make fun of your boss, but you can't make fun of the national leader.

95
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,300
Right? Okay, you get it is a big difference. So you know, everyone can make fun of the like,

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,980
no one's ever been arrested for, you know, saying they hate the President, right? No one. No,

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
no, we're not talking about, you know, whatever else assassination threats and threats and

98
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,240
intimidation. But if you said something like that, in communism, you're immediately, you know,

99
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,000
they sent you to Siberia, let's say, no questions asked, where, you know, you know, the United

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,340
States, by the way, since we're going back and forth, or in China, a couple years ago,

101
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,500
they sent people to prison for comparing, what was it using ping to Winnie the Pooh, right? Sure.

102
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,480
Or sitting on miles picture, right? Back in the days. Yeah, they're very much similar to that,

103
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,880
because the same people had set up. So right. So So the difference here is that in America,

104
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,039
if you speak bad about your boss, you're in trouble, you can speak bad about the national

105
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,280
leader. But in communism, you could speak bad about your boss, right there, where you work,

106
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,120
and they wouldn't have any effect. But I mentioned Siberia, as a place of retribution,

107
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,680
in the Soviet Union. We have one here, too, in the US, you want to guess where it is?

108
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,860
It's in the US, not Alaska. It's not has nothing to do with North.

109
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,620
No, it's got nothing to do with colder North, right? What is it? Where is it?

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,600
It's in Kansas City, Missouri, is the Siberia. And from a corporate perspective, if you if there's

111
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,500
if there's a corporation that has an office, or an adjunct or an annex in Kansas City, Missouri,

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,240
and they don't like you, that's where they send you. Anyway, it's I've heard this over and over.

113
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,500
This is from the I used to hang out with industrialists. I don't know if that makes

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,620
any sense. They have their own years ago. I sense of humor. I thought they sent you to Scottsdale.

115
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,120
That that's that's probably an annex to Yeah, very much so. Okay, which is which they're trying

116
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,900
to turn. I heard there's going to do is an I 10 that goes to the east west major thoroughfare down

117
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,520
here in the southwest. So it goes all the East Coast. Yeah, they're gonna do an I 11. And they

118
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,560
basically want to turn southern Arizona, you know, between Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tucson into

119
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,600
another like Orange County, California. All these places that are, you know, you could have bought

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:13,820
40 acres for $5,000 are going for a million dollars now. Yeah, so yeah, it's interesting.

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,580
Well, you know, there's a big exodus from there. But anyway, all these things that are changing

122
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,980
are not really changing much. It's very easy to predict, you know, politically, socioeconomically,

123
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,720
and all this other stuff. If you just look at, you know, what's been served up versus what you're

124
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,260
being told, what's being served up is right, right, right. Well, it's weird. You know, I was

125
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,460
looking at the trend. You mentioned the trend of people leaving California. Actually, I read

126
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,320
recently that they're now returning, because they want somebody because they're reactionary, right?

127
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,100
The reactionary responses. Yeah, they react. Yeah. That's why I recently got an email, which

128
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,680
was followed up again, I need to check it out a new person in the mix. And they basically stated,

129
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,080
they heard Greek speak on a podcast, they didn't say which, but they were listening to various

130
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,620
things on the internet. But when they heard the Greek speak, they're like, you're the only one

131
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,080
that's not really just reflecting mainstream occurrences. Like all the alternative media

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,520
just keeps referring to the flavor of the week, let's say. Well, that's the thing is they go,

133
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,260
Oh, what is the main almost every single one of them? What is the mainstream doing? You know,

134
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,620
and it's like, if you're basing it off of their information, and you're calling them out as a

135
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,820
liar, okay, but you're still starting with their starting point. So you're letting them dictate

136
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,880
the beginning of your script. I've never understood that. And it's all confusion. And you know,

137
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,560
no matter how true they try to be in the mainstream, it's always going to be false,

138
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,640
because they're not filling in the history that changed that perception. You see?

139
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,980
Of course, like, yeah, yeah, like, recently, I've been watching a lot of the stuff comes up,

140
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm looking up, I'm making these molds, right. And to cast certain things, you know, it's still

141
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,400
water related. But in other words, I, you know, there's the device that I make, and then I need

142
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,740
to make tools to make the device. So it's consistent. So I do some reference, you know,

143
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,620
like specific materials and things like that. And then they'll, the the algorithms like this guy,

144
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,740
maybe he's trying to start a business, right? So they start giving me all these business YouTubes,

145
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,740
I put a couple on there's this chick, Claire Sanchez or something like that. She's like,

146
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,880
in her 30s. And she's telling everyone, you know, fuck Walmart, fuck Starbucks,

147
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,760
we need corner stores, start buying businesses, open small businesses kind of thing, right?

148
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,780
Okay. But she has no idea how fiat currency runs. She has no idea what taxes really are. It's

149
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,620
there's no text, there's no taxes. How can you tax when there's no money, it's basically a return,

150
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,920
right? It's in other words, the public money is in is private property. That makes any sense,

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,840
right? And that whenever you use private property, you have to go on conditions that they set up,

152
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,020
right? Just like if you go over at the tool, like you've given the same analogy,

153
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,420
you bring it back to the rental shop, you leave it and you wave goodbye. No, you have to pay a fee.

154
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,860
And if you don't, you know, they basically come after you as a form of theft, right?

155
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Right. That's exactly what they're calling these. And these taxation agencies are not

156
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,140
even governmental, their franchises of another, right, but they're in partnership with the

157
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,800
government. Okay, here's an example. If you work for the CIA, this is a fact or the Department of

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,920
Agriculture, any of the agencies, how many there are like 170 of them, right? But there's like

159
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,160
10 major ones, right? You know, FDA, Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy. By the way,

160
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,520
Department of Energy is the one that runs shit, by the way. Okay, you can go on government property.

161
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,140
And they have signs, you know, like Area 51, you can get shot, whatever. If you go on Department

162
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,600
of Energy property, they shoot you and then get show you the sign. It's they're very, very serious.

163
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,740
Right. In other words, like when you talk, this is out of tangent. But when you talk about 911,

164
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:05,260
Department of Energy had to okay the trigger devices, right? Because the devices don't

165
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,980
have triggers built in. It's kind of like you have guns, but no bullets, right? Right. Okay.

166
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,840
Yeah. So they so when when when a certain nuclear demolition is approved,

167
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,300
through the Department of Energy, and you know, a small group or whatever, you know, back and forth,

168
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,840
they provide the trigger device. And basically, the device looks like an eight foot fire

169
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,120
extinguisher has an access panel and you install the trigger device and it runs a rudimentary How

170
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,380
do I know all this stuff? Anyway, anyway? I wonder if anyone's asking that question,

171
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,720
because I won't tell. But yeah, so they run a rudimentary startup thing. And it lets you know

172
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,960
if it'll work without, you know, anyway. Now, when the Department of Energy sends the trigger devices

173
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:55,240
to these nukes, they don't call a courier and they don't have someone in house, they call the OST,

174
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,480
which is the Office of Special Transportation. You might have seen something like that in some

175
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,660
of the movies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where they want to transport things and

176
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,540
they put like a McDonald's as a trailer. And it says McDonald's on the side or Piggly Wiggly or,

177
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,440
or, you know, Target, you know, right. So they Yeah, so they're on the film. Yeah. You By the

178
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,020
way, if you know what to look for, if you're on the highway, you can tell if it's an OST

179
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:26,560
transport or a real McDonald's truck full of buns, but I won't get into that. Okay. Yeah. And you

180
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,240
think about it, because someone if someone finds out and they want to, let's say take that McDonald's

181
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,720
truck, because it has nukes inside of it, they have to be able to protect it. Right. So when you

182
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,200
look at some of these trucks on the highway, I've spent a lot of time, you'll see some of them look

183
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,780
like normal trucks, but they're extremely unusual. Things built into it that it looks like you can

184
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:53,760
hit it with a tank round and it would survive, right? So anyway, so why wasn't all this alternative

185
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,580
media? Why didn't they say anything about Department of Energy, the Port Authority and the

186
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,500
OST, Office of Special Transportation, which, by the way, is a part of the Secret Service?

187
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,480
Oh, boy, I can keep going. You know, why? Because none of this is mentioned ever. Okay. But you

188
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,940
could everything I said you could look up. Pretty much as time goes on, you it'll be harder and

189
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,760
harder. But let me go back to these agencies. If you work for the CIA, and you're going to be,

190
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,720
let's say doing something with the Department of Agriculture or the FBI or the executive

191
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,540
office of the President, when you start filling out paperwork, you know, to start whatever they

192
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:46,360
requested, you know, that agency goes under a heading as a customer. Right? Yeah. So when you're

193
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,840
Yeah. So when let's say Department of Agriculture, let's say the FDA wants to investigate someone,

194
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,980
and they call the FBI, right? That's pretty normal, right? FBI raids.

195
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,440
So the FDA wants an investigation, they call an investigative agency, the FBI. Okay,

196
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,720
yeah. Now, when the FBI starts filling out the paperwork, the paperwork clearly states who's

197
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,540
the customer. And they write FDA. So in other words, all the agencies are viewing anyone that

198
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,760
any action they do as a customer, who's the principal, who's issuing this request? Who is

199
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,900
this action for? It's not like agency or government authority or order its customer? What does that

200
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,520
tell you who has customers businesses? Right? Do you get this? And you right? Give me an example.

201
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:41,600
The IRS has like 100,000 plus people on payroll. This was true up until the early 2000s, right?

202
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,620
They couldn't do payroll for their own people. Oh, well, they didn't they had the Department of

203
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,760
Agriculture do the payroll for the IRS employees. And someone asked internally, why is the Department

204
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,520
of Agriculture doing payroll for the IRS and the IRS head honchos in the admin group said because

205
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,320
they have better bookkeeping than we do. I'm serious. You can't make this stuff up. No,

206
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,260
that's hilarious. But yeah, it is because the IRS is not based on but it's based on legal

207
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,900
presumption to send you a bill. For example, like, I know someone that they did some stuff

208
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,780
and say, all right, so you owe us $1,500 from 10 years ago or whatever. Right? Because it's a 10

209
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,520
year limitation, by the way, for them to class. So she sent them a check for 1500. Three months

210
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,820
later, he gets another bill for 1500. And why am I getting on the bill? Oh, this bill is for

211
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:37,620
processing the 1500 that you sent before. And then while he's arguing that he gets another $500 a

212
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,860
day, it just never ends because there's nothing to do with what you think it is.

213
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,840
Right? You're the one people if you can, if you're a living, breathing soul,

214
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,300
with blood running through you, and you have a pen, you have unlimited credit, there's unlimited

215
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,580
credit. They don't none of the agencies, you know, the corporation, they can't let you know that you

216
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,880
do so they want to get as much out of you as possible. And they don't need to, by the way,

217
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,340
when you write them a check, you don't need to have the money in the bank, they could just use

218
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,360
the signature off of your thing, but your bank will complain and they'll still complain to make

219
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,280
it look like you know, you didn't do the right thing, right? That's why they when you look to go

220
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,300
to certain shops, you turn your Attorney General says prosecutes bad check writers. Yes, you've

221
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,720
seen those signs. There's no such thing. They can't say they cannot use legal terminology.

222
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,720
They cannot they have to use what they call common parlance. Because in legal terminology,

223
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,460
in Title 12, I think it's 95, or 95 B. No, not 95. It's just prior to it might be 92. It states that

224
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,100
there's nothing anyone could write that can be held against them in a financial instrument. So

225
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,180
basically, you could write a million dollars on a piece of paper and sign your name and have

226
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,720
someone else sign it, you should literally go to the Treasury window, it'll be good.

227
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,820
Right? This is in the codes. But you can't let people know this, because suddenly, what will

228
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:05,180
happen? Right? Everybody will show up signing a paper. And yeah, yeah, they'll say, screw you.

229
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,980
Why do you leave the door open with the heat on and the water running all day? Screw you.

230
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,960
Right? You see, this is because Yeah, so I'm not blaming the agencies or the attorneys or

231
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,320
everything. They are scumbags. But but the blame is not on them. You know, news and mainstream media,

232
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,180
who do we blame? Right? It's the people. You know, the people need to write be more.

233
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,100
I don't know how you'd say it. They're basically savages that need to be

234
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,940
monitored. And yes, monitored and managed. Who is it Nietzsche that said the common man is best?

235
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,100
These aren't the right. But these aren't really the right people to be monitoring and managing,

236
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,380
though, are they? I mean, or are they? But here's the thing, like someone says, Oh, he's a good

237
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,800
doctor. So what do you mean? He's from Jupiter? What planet is he from? Like, you know, if you

238
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,980
say someone is a doctor, well, how did they become a doctor? There's a school requirement.

239
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,940
Go look at the school that he went to and go look at the syllabus and the curriculum that he was

240
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,540
trained under. Is that syllabus or curriculum reflect what he's supposed to be doing? No,

241
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,480
it doesn't usually know, right? No, it doesn't teach. Right. So what's going? So I mean,

242
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,240
there's so much to collect on what's going on here to piece it together. But you know,

243
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,360
one thing that I'm proud of is, I'm able to do okay, I've spent countless of for not countless,

244
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,620
because it's limited, but many, many, many, many hundreds, if not 1000s of hours doing a lot of

245
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:37,080
boring, really boring, dull drum footwork to present what I've talked about. Okay, right.

246
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,160
So when I say that, you know, all this stuff that they don't know what they're talking about,

247
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,180
I didn't read it in some book somewhere directly that what I did is I started going through

248
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,800
everything that they're supposed to be doing and everything that's written that they're supposed to

249
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:57,500
know, and it doesn't correspond. So but I said, Why isn't anyone talking about this? Right?

250
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,380
No one's talking about any of this stuff. So like, Oh, my gosh, I mean, I'm the one that's

251
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,460
gonna have to start talking about it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, because it seems to me as though

252
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,020
people just react based on their feelings. They don't bother to find out how anything works.

253
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,720
No, I agree. They just look the people that they trust, who's the authority that's supposed to know

254
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,900
are not doing their job either. So it has to be right. So it's, it's all about trust. Look here.

255
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,100
Let's see who's more to blame. Look, if you put an idiot in charge of things,

256
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,440
and it doesn't go well, you know, who's more to blame the idiot or you put the idea,

257
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,460
but they're not in charge. It's just a puppet show. Because very clearly, we know that

258
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,940
all the you know, the script, basically, who's writing the script, it's not the actor.

259
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,320
Yeah, they're just they're called actors anyway. But But here's the thing. Yeah. When you

260
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,320
when you look at the situation, and what's going on, and what's available to people,

261
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,240
you know, and they're not and they don't go right. So let me give you an example.

262
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,180
This, I've heard this indirectly a couple of times already with medicines, especially with

263
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,620
the vaccines recently, that killed all these people, supposedly, or they're still sick from it.

264
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,440
The answer now that's being given is, well, no one forced you to take it.

265
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,960
No, no, I'm serious. But they did. But they someone says, well,

266
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:23,600
right, so the coercion, what is it? Yeah, but right. So yeah, it's it's not.

267
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,760
Yeah. But see, you're not gonna have a job. But see, you're not going to be allowed to go to

268
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,140
school. But see, we'll put you in jail. Send your kids to school. No, but you know what I'm saying

269
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,260
is that all these preconditions, then the intimidation comes in, we're going to take

270
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,820
all these things away, right? That's right. But if you're weak enough, right? Like, here's the

271
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,560
thing. This is what I say. You know, you've heard about people taking advantage of others, you know,

272
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,540
or could by controlling them and whatever, people that are easy to take advantage of are not worth

273
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,500
taking advantage of. You get it. But here's the problem. If someone is so weak that they

274
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,140
can be manipulated, those people are not worth manipulating, because they got nothing off. Or what

275
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,640
could they possibly do? Well, then next week, that week, you know, the only good for your skin,

276
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
right? Well, I got you. But explain to me the world around me, then, because all I see are people

277
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,720
that are really, you know, not worthy. Much higher. We've got into that. That's the cosmic

278
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,320
censorship. That's the much higher realm. Let's say, oh, the how would you say a blanket statement

279
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,140
would not cover that, right? Because as you go higher, it gets more dense. And the more dense it

280
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,440
gets, the more simple these principles get. And then when you go down, they seem to disperse and

281
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,200
become more complicated. But essentially, the human perspective is basically how it's raised. It's

282
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,720
based on its culture, not not on the individual, not on the Jack Fresco has gone into this a lot,

283
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,500
there's no human nature, it's human culture, you know, what, what upbringing you have,

284
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,720
it's not specific to, and I've gone into it a lot with the, we don't come with a pre downloaded

285
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,200
operating system, right? You know, reiterate, yeah, no puppy dog, a puppy dog raised by gorillas

286
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,260
will always act like a puppy, like a normal dog at adulthood, but a human raised by gorillas will

287
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,600
act like a gorilla when it's an adult. Right, right. No, true. And that's, that's no question.

288
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,900
I mean, there's no doubt about that. Right. And look, frescoes most interesting in that he takes

289
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,040
a step back, and kind of says, Look, in perspective, what is all this crap worth? You know,

290
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,860
all of this? I mean, what is the famous line? Yeah, he got really? Yeah, but go ahead. All this

291
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,040
shit has to go. You know, yeah, I like that. I love that. But he doesn't have a vibe. His viable

292
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,380
replacement was these concrete centralized cities where everything was very efficient,

293
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,720
and organic looking, let's say, but he didn't give too much of a structure for the raising of a

294
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,860
individual, right, let's say, or the collective, because the collective and the individual are the

295
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,040
same, right? Well, no, you pull an individual out of a collective, they still reflect, right,

296
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,100
you can take the man out of the street, you can take the street out of the man, and whatever,

297
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,240
whatever, I get that man out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the man.

298
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,780
Fair enough. But what I'm saying is, it was an interesting perspective to me, because

299
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,620
look, you take away all those things that are major struggles, right? You take away,

300
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,860
you don't have to go ahead and struggle or do a job or do this or do that, because

301
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,320
there are a bunch of self sufficient mechanisms that are available to the community. Now,

302
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:33,860
if you do that, then what do you have left, you have the ability to expand, why not learn a craft?

303
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:39,640
Why not develop those things that could be part of the culture, as opposed to wasting your time in

304
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,220
a bunch of repetitious action to collect the fiat currency? It's not a waste of time. Here,

305
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,760
like, to give you a perspective, sometimes you hear people, you know, in a relationship for a

306
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,460
few years or many years, and when they decide to separate, they'll say, well, I wasted 10 years

307
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,740
with you or whatever. No, because was the years before you met that person wasted? Right? You see,

308
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,260
what's waste? You know, what does that mean? What's lost? Like, I lost this time with you.

309
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,220
Okay, so what about the time before you even started? What was that lost to?

310
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,260
Where does it add up? Where does it lead to? Where is it? It doesn't.

311
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,360
From that perspective, you must go to a higher perspective to see what's going on.

312
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,000
In defense of that, right? I think it comes from the idea that, look, I invested this amount of

313
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,960
time, I invested this amount of energy. And here's what I feel like I got back out of it.

314
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,460
I think they're looking at it as a transactional. Sure. But again, it's cultural. It's cultural,

315
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,560
right? Because from, again, the culture on the ground boots on there. But if you go to a higher

316
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,940
perspective, you see above the culture and you see that how many times have you heard like,

317
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,220
well, it's meant to be right. And I've had a lot of meant to be moments where, you know,

318
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,420
like, for example, just something simple as what's called driving, someone cuts me off,

319
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,380
I couldn't go into the lane that I wanted to go into. And I'm like, shit, you know,

320
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,580
I got to go around, you know, another block now and make a U-turn. Well, when I'm sitting there

321
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,280
saying shit, you know, that guy cut me off, I didn't make it to the lane. I hear a loud boom,

322
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,040
man, if someone was not paying attention on their cell phone rear ended the car

323
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:21,060
that was supposed to be me. And I'm like, Oh, that wasn't so bad that getting cut off

324
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,960
you see what I mean? Well, and that's always another perspective there. When you're talking

325
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,660
about somebody says they wasted 10 years, it could be that they were with that person. So

326
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,320
they avoided something else because they were tied up with that person, as opposed to getting involved

327
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,860
with, you know, the person that's going to cut them up into dog food and feed them to another

328
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,520
victim in a basement somewhere. I mean, you know, by the way, I'm tired of hearing you hear about,

329
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,840
you know, the guy chops up his girlfriend, right? Yeah. Oh, he's an evil guy. Or and then you got

330
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,620
the other one where the woman cuts off her husband's dick, right? Oh, she's bad. No, no,

331
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,320
you got to look at the other side, what would have driven even if the person's unstable,

332
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,920
another person to the point where they have to chop up their spouse or girlfriend or mate,

333
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,880
or cut their dick away. You know, everyone always goes to the automatic simply like the victim,

334
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,580
right? All the victims, right? Whoever did it is wrong. What no one ever starts and thinks like,

335
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,440
wait a second, let's look at it from the other perspective. What kind of a rotten ass

336
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,200
would have drove driven another person to do that today?

337
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,320
Look, you know what? You know why I'm laughing? Because I've never heard you say this before.

338
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,020
And I think you and I are the only two people that I have ever heard articulate something like this.

339
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,240
I swear to you, this is exactly what I think about. There was a story recently that I was

340
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,200
reading about and somebody I don't know why people sent it to me repeatedly. And this woman cut off

341
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,260
her boyfriend's head, okay, and stuck it in a bucket and put it in the bottom of the steps

342
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,060
for his mother. I guess the two of them were living like in the upstairs.

343
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,940
Oh my gosh. Yeah, but since the detail, it sounds like the guy in New York had cut off

344
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,080
girlfriend's head and even cooked it and served it to the homeless in Thompson Square Park. It

345
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,080
goes on and on and on. Or there was the guy who was walking around Penn Station,

346
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,960
just carrying his girlfriend's head. I don't know if you remember that one from.

347
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,580
Yeah, that's right. And but but this is very not not to not to mix this up with serial killers,

348
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,760
which are military operations, by the way. Oh, absolutely. But no, I also real killers that

349
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,520
you've been made aware of, even the Russian one who did like 300 people is part of the military.

350
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,000
There's active military while they were doing it under orders. Right. So anyway, no, no. And you

351
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,320
know, that guy that was walking around Penn Station with his girlfriend's head. I missed

352
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,040
that guy by 10 minutes, literally. No, I got you. But what I'm saying here is the victim.

353
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,280
So everyone's like, oh, if she cut off his dick, she's terrible. Well, what drove? No,

354
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,300
I think the guy, the person who got their dick cut off must have been worse because what would

355
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,360
have driven even someone who was even considered unstable to that point to do that, because

356
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,500
humans are not really like that without even a judgment. I don't even try and go for the

357
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,060
judgment part of it. But no one's ever even looking. No. But when you're saying, oh,

358
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,260
they must be terrible and forget that. I ask the open question. What in the hell

359
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,140
got to a certain point here, regardless of if they're out of there? Like I'm asking the open

360
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:20,040
question, what actually inspired that? You know, that's right. Well, I can tell you very simply,

361
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,200
it was constant and very high level, whatever to get that, you know. So right. So the guy

362
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,320
cut the girlfriend's head off. She must have been really horrible because, you know,

363
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,520
then I heard of bad things happen to good people. But, you know, something that extreme. And just

364
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:44,600
what was the famous one where she used Bobbitt? Yeah. Yeah. He got a silicone penis and it was

365
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,960
all famous and all that. John Wayne. But I think he actually got it reattached and then did porno

366
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,520
movies afterwards, if I remember. Oh, my gosh. Or whatever. Yeah. So, yeah. But, you know, it's

367
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,800
yeah. That was the only one that I've seen where the sympathy didn't go extreme in either direction.

368
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,440
No, it was kind of weird because it was Lorraine Bobbitt on the other side. And what came out is

369
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,420
like, well, he was beating her and he was doing this and he was doing that. And then she was

370
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,520
right. Exactly. That's the point, you know. But this is very different from what you hear of

371
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,800
put out there. But this is OK without belaboring it anymore. This is the culture. Again, no one

372
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,980
is examining anything. So once it's examined, opinion aside, you'll be able to see a little

373
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,100
better until people are able to see things aren't going to change. But fortunately, we don't have a

374
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,900
lot of time. So.
