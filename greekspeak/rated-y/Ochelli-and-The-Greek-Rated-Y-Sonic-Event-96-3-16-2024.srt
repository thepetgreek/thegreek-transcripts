00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,560
Sonic Event 96 rated Y and interesting, interesting times we live in, maybe, or maybe you're bored

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,120
to death.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,680
Who knows?

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,440
It is the, what, the Ides of March, right?

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,820
Beware the Ides of March.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,920
Julius Caesar, isn't this when the conspiracy- It's arbitrary, though, when you use the number

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
in the day, right?

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,100
Like, it was supposedly Friday, and today's the next day, but what I did want to bring

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,440
up is that it's measurable, 12 hours, well, on the, oh, gosh, wonder ground weather.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,820
I've been looking at about two weeks ago, and it was 11 hours, you know how many minutes

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,260
per day.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Today, I guessed it, and I looked it up, it was correct, it was 12 hours, zero minutes.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,200
So today is the equal day, equal night break.

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,480
It's on the Pope's work schedule, let's say, American Southwest, it's the 16th on a Saturday

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,520
night, so we had to, and what's interesting, this week, I was following the sun coming

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,920
in, the building I live in, the house I live in, is really north-south cardinal, so the

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,100
front door and the back door walls are west and east, and one end of the other end of

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,060
the house is north, the other end of the house is south, and I mean dead on.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,420
So in the morning, when I get up, the back door, let's say, kitchen area, when the sun

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,680
is due east, it just comes in, centered on the door, and makes a perfect square on the

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,100
opposite living room wall, and that happened today, yeah.

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,180
So you can actually, you know, basically, it's a form of sundial, right?

23
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,160
Well, I guess, is your house is oriented, you mean to say exactly so that, you know?

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,660
Exactly north-south-east, yeah, in other words, the rectangle, that is the floor plan

25
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,520
of the house, is aligned, all the walls are aligned with the cardinal directions, not

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,340
magnetic north, but true north, you know, as the poles and the solar movements go.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,460
Yeah, so I want to bring that up, also we're getting into a change of season, which is

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,200
my favorite time of year, and it should be yours as well, because it's, whatever you

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,780
experience during that season, here's a time for it to change, right, and what I mean by

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:25,500
it should be yours as well, is, okay, you have the day-night-day, the atmosphere expands,

31
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,820
pulls everything apart, at night the atmosphere contracts, compresses everything, so the yin

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,720
and yang again, right?

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,340
You cannot fight that, so if you have a condition, or you want to do something when the atmosphere

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,420
is being pulled apart in the day, that will overwhelm you, right?

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,000
Where, if you want, when the atmosphere is compressing at night, right, you want to stay

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,980
uncompressed, no matter what drugs or exercises you do, it might counter that a little, but

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,280
the overwhelming force of it being nighttime will overwhelm you, right?

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,540
So the actual seasons overwhelm you as well, and now we're in a transition.

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,220
Well you know, because almost everything is personalized, though, I got a question here,

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,300
and I got to drop a little information, and then ask the question, so I give you context

41
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,560
for it, but here's the deal.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,060
I always think to myself, and this is the right time of year for me, because about a

43
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,300
month from now, I guess, a little less than a month from now, is what they call my birthday.

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,080
Now you and I have gone over this about the cultural idea, and the weirdness, and the

45
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,520
sweet cake, and all that about birthdays, and maybe we'll do that one more time in the

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,160
near future, but put that aside.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,020
Yeah, very hard to find information on that, but go ahead.

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah, no, it is difficult to find information on it, but it is the reality in front of you,

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,120
it's obvious, but here's the question for me, because of what it is I experience.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,080
Around this time of year, around the time of year that I was born, and indeed around

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,360
the time of night that I was born, it is dark when I was born, you know, it was dark on

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,720
that day.

53
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,580
Well if you were born in the spring, it's the same as being born in the fall, in terms

54
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,860
of the overall pressure, but the direction is going in a different direction.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,860
Right, but the thing is this, I feel as though things can be easier renewed around the time

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,540
I was born.

57
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,500
I feel as though I get a little bit of a recharge, and I'm wondering if that's a psychological

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,060
thing, because so many elements of your life, whether you realize it or not, and whether

59
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,580
you're one of these hardline schedule people or not, it always ends up revolving around

60
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,840
the marking of the day, you know, because some people might say, why do you bother?

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,620
What I'm talking about is exercising perception, like most people, when you have a change of

62
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,200
season, they call, oh, we're going into the holiday season, or it's going to be Easter,

63
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,980
or it's springtime, or it's fall, let's go fly a kite, this is before video games, when

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,480
fall came, we went out and bought these kites, Gala was the brand, right, I don't even think

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,340
people do that anymore.

66
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,880
You got treated to the Charlie Brown would try to fly a kite, and you never could get

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
the kite to fly, and yeah, of course.

68
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,240
Yeah, but you know, that's the kind of child that I had.

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,380
So the only thing that resembled a video game was a pinball machine, let's say, right, or

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,040
those soccer fooball things, you know, with the men on the rods that you twist.

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,520
Oh, foosball!

72
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,340
Air hockey, foosball, yeah.

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,100
So what I'm trying to say, it's an exercise in perception, when everyone else is saying

74
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,400
this season is coming, and they're acknowledging it, you're acknowledging it differently.

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,860
In other words, with an energetic concept, because here, I'm going to say something that

76
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:40,500
I've never said before, and I do this in private conversations with people that are studying

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,060
finer energies, I keep hearing recently, this is a little bit of a tangent, the emo, what's

78
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,040
the purpose of emotions, I have speakers throughout when I'm working.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,520
And sometimes when I clear the computer, the YouTube music or whatever, it's on continuous

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
play, and it'll play a video.

81
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,800
And I'm like, Oh, no, why isn't it music?

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,300
What happened?

83
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,540
Right?

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
So I go to change it.

85
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,560
But last week, three times, various podcasts came up.

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,900
And the thing that was in common with all of them was, what is the purpose of having

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,380
emotions?

88
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,280
Or why do we have emotions?

89
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Or what's the reason for emotions?

90
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
I was like, Okay, I got to bring it up.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,200
What what the emotions are, it is a clear state of consciousness.

92
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,860
Now, what?

93
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,360
Well, wait a second, because people seem to be reasonable, and they do unreasonable things

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
when they're emotional, right?

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,000
It seems like clarity would be the last thing you'd think of if you're getting emotional.

96
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
But yeah, good.

97
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,740
What it is, is it's a contrast.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,660
Right now, we're mortal beings in a physical container that's mortal.

99
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,580
And in a very mortal, violent world, the world is very violent.

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,000
You know, when you talk about, will there ever always be war?

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes, there will always be war.

102
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,560
And in other words, to stop the war, you're going to need overcoming it with even something

103
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,380
more powerful.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,280
And whoever has that is the one who decides.

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,520
Well, emotion, if you're connected to emotion directly, and you're very clear on what your

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,260
emotions are, in all honesty, they teach you that that means that you're unclear in your

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,600
thinking.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,340
But the truth is, you've eliminated a whole lot of the confusion, nonsense and programming,

109
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,840
if you're directly in touch with these things that are, you know, not just reactive, but

110
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,520
proactive, your emotions, right?

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,420
That's the mix that I'm bringing up here.

112
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,320
So in other words, all the negativity, the necessity for animals to kill other animals

113
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,540
to live and the way the ills of society and the ills that you die after a certain age,

114
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,460
even if it's 1000, let's say, okay, that is a stark reality that you're in a mortal situation

115
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,000
usually ends up not very good because you die.

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,340
What the emote and you have your reasonable thoughts based on your education, your culture,

117
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,220
what the emotions are, is the source form of reasoning and thinking how your consciousness

118
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,920
would be when you are in an immortal state from the immortal realm.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,300
There is an immortal realm, it changes, but it changes in line with how change is known

120
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,420
on the emotional level, where right now, if you are on the physical mortal level, when

121
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,120
you talk about change, whether it's, you know, whatever type of physics, pick your flavor

122
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,000
or philosophy, you're going to always lean on change being material or the ebb and flow

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
of energies, right?

124
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,120
That is still mortal.

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,740
There is a side of us that is sourced from an immortal realm, where death is not known

126
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,780
and degradation is not known.

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,679
And in that realm, when you exist in that realm, your form of reasoning and thinking

128
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,720
is all emotion.

129
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,039
So the emotion we have here is a trickle over a spillover, a carryover from that realm.

130
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,240
And I'm going to end it right there, because that could be developed.

131
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,040
This has never been said before, by the way, as far as I know, because all I can see is

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,600
that it is a direct line.

133
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,040
It seems to me to be more of the natural state, actually, if you react with emotion, and thought

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,800
is something that is, what, done in the after action.

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,660
You have two types of thought.

136
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,720
You see, in the immortal realm, it's all emo.

137
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,600
In the physical realm, it's the type of reasoning we have.

138
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,400
That's why, for example, I'll give a little more.

139
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,400
That's why when people are, let's say, a mild mannered guy, nine to five, family, white

140
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,180
picket fence, new car, right?

141
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,460
One day he comes home and kills his whole family and kills himself.

142
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,060
We never saw that coming.

143
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,180
What kind of an emotional state?

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,840
You can also be the opposite.

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,560
You could be something with a tremendous amount of elation, right?

146
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,380
Someone deciding, I'm going to just give everything I have to the poor and live in an RV or something.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,020
What I mean by that is that whether it's really drastic and negative or elation, when you

148
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,360
bring that immortal realm into here, they too don't mix entirely.

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,440
When you have too much emotion happening, and you, let's say, kill your whole family and

150
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
then yourself, that is something that doesn't take place in the other realm.

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,560
But because you're mixing the two and you have too much of that energy coming here, it

152
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,580
ended up really negative here, you see.

153
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,660
I'm still working on this.

154
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm looking for tidbits that have been around.

155
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,960
It's very hard to find, but there's always ... You know how there's been talk in all

156
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,160
of the ancient scripts, and even modern, whatever.

157
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,840
There is another realm, right?

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,560
Plato is the one that made it academically the most, the platonic heavenly realm, right?

159
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,980
What is perfect white?

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,940
We have all these whites.

161
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,580
We say the color white, for example.

162
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,440
Polar bear is white.

163
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,100
Snow is white.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,740
The wall is white.

165
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,480
But they're all different.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Somewhere in a platonic realm, there is a perfect representation.

167
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,880
That's what I'm discussing.

168
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,060
Even in that realm, there are several shades of white, but it is an immortal realm.

169
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,680
In other words, that is the source realm.

170
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,960
The emotions that we have, and by the way, animals have emotions too, and so do plants.

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:52,000
How much is there to the immortal realm, considering that we know that only the chief deity is

172
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:00,580
the only living thing, living existence, that doesn't know death, as far as I know?

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,380
It's complicated, because it becomes a paradox, and any paradox can be solved outside of the

174
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,600
thinking that led it to become a paradox.

175
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:22,320
This is too formative, I don't know, but there's something to be ... In other words, when you

176
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,860
look at pure material reasoning, let's say a high culture with high science that's in

177
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:38,300
harmony with its environment, that could still be dubbed reason and thinking, but it could

178
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,460
also be separated from an emotional counterpart.

179
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm saying that in its entirety, there is another realm, and in its entirety, all of

180
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,400
its thought is emo, and that spillover is what we experience.

181
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,460
Anyway, enough of that.

182
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,560
I want to get back into the change of season and why it's important, because people that

183
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,320
are living upside down, they're going into a cold season, right?

184
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,600
So you have transition, we've discussed diet, and of course, there's, what would you say,

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,400
utensils, implements, now you prepare your living space to either be cooled down instead

186
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,640
of heated, or vice versa, depending on the season that you're going into, right?

187
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,540
So when you perceive these things in a fine way, very simple, up here we're going into

188
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,360
an expansion time, right?

189
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,200
And down, where people are living upside down, they're going into a contraction time.

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,780
So the sooner you prepare for that, right, like for example, you know how I talk about

191
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,880
food is seasonal, right?

192
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,620
Don't eat salmon in the summertime, right, because it's an Arctic fish, it'll make your

193
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,460
blood thicker, you won't be able to cool down, right?

194
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,200
So let's say winter's coming, don't eat tropical fruit, but don't, so if you heard something

195
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,140
like this from Greek-speaking, you're in the middle of the season, you could still make

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,900
a change, but actually starting to change it before the season kicks in makes it really,

197
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,740
really simple, and you adapt really, really well to it, right?

198
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,300
So for example, I've been getting into walking barefoot a lot, so when fall was, I made sure

199
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,260
that I started walking barefoot more and more as fall season started going into winter,

200
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,020
so now I could be more transitioned and used to being barefoot even in the winter, right?

201
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
But if I decided to go barefoot and it was middle of winter, boy, would that be uncomfortable,

202
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,020
right?

203
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,920
So, you know, and Diogenes made a couple of talks about that, but a couple little snippets,

204
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:39,000
but either way, now is the time to consider what's coming and prepare for it energetically,

205
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,600
right?

206
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,260
Because the way society and culture has been taught to prepare for things is basically

207
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,860
within whatever culture they're living in, and it's really dumb, right?

208
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:55,000
There's not much talk about it, so, but yeah, the other thing I wanted to bring up, and this

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,620
is a segue, total segue, people are familiar that frequent Greek-speak, that I've been

210
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,560
working on water devices, particularly one called the Scalarator, basically-

211
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,220
Before, hang on just a sec, before you segue into that, I really do want to ask this question

212
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,300
because I think it might be relevant, alongside of the change of seasons, and you should recognize

213
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,480
this, this does change many of the things that you need to, you know, go along and go

214
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
along with the flow-

215
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,420
You get the most benefit if you start thinking and adapting now.

216
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,480
Right, a little bit ahead of it, but the thing is, is there a personal element to this, though,

217
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,340
where like I said with the birthday thing, so I'm born in the spring time, for where

218
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,760
I live now and where I was born-

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,400
Hold on, let me just interject something, I'm going to lean on the nine star key, you're

220
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,420
older than 18, right?

221
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Yes.

222
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,500
It doesn't have any relevance anymore.

223
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,360
It's no longer relevant.

224
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,160
Up until you're 18, I would say, child was born at night, consider that, but you're way

225
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,520
over that and it has no relevance anymore.

226
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,040
Go ahead.

227
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
No, but it's funny-

228
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm not trying to dismiss what you're saying, but I'm saying that when you're older than

229
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,360
18 as an adult, using tendencies that were from when you were infantile or your early

230
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,780
state doesn't work anymore.

231
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,960
Well, true, but certain conditions do persist throughout your life regardless of your age,

232
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,240
for instance, you're always going to require food and water.

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,500
What I'm saying is that I'm just curious and you're telling me that once you get past the

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,700
developmental time-

235
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,260
18 or 20.

236
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,060
Somewhere in that time where society says you're about an adult in there is when that's

237
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,660
no longer relevant.

238
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah, 20 is the best because it carries late bloomers as well, right?

239
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,480
There's no personalized end to this where it's like if you're saying-

240
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,220
There is.

241
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,140
Okay, well that's-

242
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,740
There is personalized.

243
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,240
When you get older, you switch to a different character.

244
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,740
Look at the Nine Star Key.

245
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,540
I brought up Nine Star Key.

246
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,660
Remember, this is not like horoscopes.

247
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,240
This is based on statistics.

248
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:00,240
In the earlier imperial oriental empires, they would have statisticians over 4,000 years

249
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,380
now collecting information on people from birthmarks on their body, what businesses they did, how

250
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,020
their lives went, and they collected all this information when they were born and all this.

251
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,020
It has to do more with the seasonal calendar because the year starts around February, more

252
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,100
like what they call the Asian New Year.

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,380
That would apply.

254
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,800
Here, give me an example.

255
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,460
I've turned several years ago, especially, several people onto Nine Star Key who were

256
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,900
big into the horoscope stuff.

257
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,880
They put the horoscope stuff aside and said, wow, this is super accurate, but they had to

258
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,800
go back to it because you're not going to create a business out of Nine Star Key in

259
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,040
a Western society, right?

260
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,940
It's probably not as-

261
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,300
It's far more accurate.

262
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:42,900
Yeah.

263
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,660
It's not as interesting to look at, though.

264
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,160
It doesn't have all the fun stuff like your animal and all these other things, right?

265
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,580
Actually, yeah, but it has energies and it shows you how people relate, but yeah, I found

266
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,040
it to be a pretty good statistical measurement.

267
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,980
Now, you know there's things that break statistics all the time, right?

268
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,640
Well, look, a statistic, nothing is absolute and therefore there will always be exceptions

269
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,460
even to the strongest rules.

270
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,220
Of course, but it's one of the better structures that we have that are cosmologically based,

271
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:14,599
let's say.

272
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,220
Cosmologically meaning it's time and season and not necessarily, there's no astronomical

273
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,599
stuff in it, very little.

274
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,020
Right, and there's no one size fits all no matter what you do.

275
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,560
I was talking about before, it'll always prevail that you'll require food and water,

276
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,480
but some people might be able to survive a lot longer without food than others because

277
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,340
of various things.

278
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,500
Yeah, that's conditioning.

279
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,800
I think that's all conditioning because when you notice, especially going into the seasonal

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,820
change into various seasons, you'll notice, okay, for example, when it's really hot out,

281
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,640
you don't eat much.

282
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,000
Even in the military, when they prepare MREs, they make sure that they have, quote unquote,

283
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,720
more calories in the winter, MREs.

284
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,280
In the military, they have summer food and winter food, but what they do is differentiate,

285
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,800
quote unquote, thermal calories, which we've been over that.

286
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,160
We might want to recap the container.

287
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah, there's a little bit coming out right now that calories have nothing to do with health

288
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,920
and finally, it's like 25 years or so of discussing this.

289
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,260
Well, I think soon we should do an absolute dedicated recap to the container because I

290
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,880
think that would be helpful.

291
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,840
I think it should be once every so often as a, what do you call it, a refresher.

292
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,840
Yeah, definitely.

293
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,340
Yeah, because memory, even my own, very often people ask me about certain things and after

294
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,320
I leave, I'm like, you know what?

295
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,060
I didn't tell them about this, that, or the other.

296
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,520
Right.

297
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,760
Before we move on to the Scalarator though, but you're saying the nine star key thing

298
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,160
is the way to take a look at it and try to personalize this as far as ...

299
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,440
Oh, yeah.

300
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,880
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

301
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:57,340
You'll notice that when you ... This is when the nine star key works really well to see

302
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,580
how accurate, for its accuracy and how ... Is when you do it on yourself, you're like, okay,

303
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,660
I'm kind of like that, but when you start doing it on other people that you know, you have

304
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,520
to know when they were born pretty much and then it gets into male, female and all that

305
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,040
other stuff.

306
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,120
Then you'll start saying, oh my gosh, because when you do it on someone else that you know

307
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,680
or spend a lot of time with, for example, it's easier to see them overall because you're

308
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
outside of them, right?

309
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,340
It's kind of hard to see outside of yourself, but when you start seeing how accurate it

310
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,400
is with others, then you go back and reflect more on yourself and you're like, oh wow,

311
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,240
I could see how accurate it really is.

312
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
We did a couple of talks on this about a month or two ago.

313
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,840
Yeah, and the other thing is, look, if you're judging someone from the outside, you have

314
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,980
enough of a disconnect where you're not going to sit there, let's be honest here, a lot

315
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,240
of people will fudge their numbers a bit, you know what I mean?

316
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,920
You can easier judge somebody, maybe that person eats too much, maybe, but you don't

317
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,240
see that you eat too much or, you know, go ahead.

318
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,080
The reason why you judge them outside is because you're not hearing their internal dialogue.

319
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,560
Right.

320
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,900
See, when you have the internal voices, right, that hopefully, from listening to enough Greek

321
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,680
speak, you shut them down by anticipating them, you know, there's an old saying, are the

322
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,380
voices in my head bothering you, right?

323
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,760
So anyway, yeah, so let's go to the Scalarator real quick.

324
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah, let's move on.

325
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,040
What I want to bring up is, everything that I've presented so far, people that have gone

326
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,520
to the chat have seen it, right?

327
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,580
Right now we've established for sure we're on Gen 2, no longer producing Gen 1.

328
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,480
What does Gen 2 look like?

329
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,100
Like Gen 1 with a double spool.

330
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,940
So when you see a pipe going around a central disc that's copper or gold, you'll see two,

331
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,500
a double wrap now.

332
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,180
And why was that done is because when the device was hooked up, it gave certain results.

333
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,100
And the basic reasoning is, what if I put two in series, it should be better, right?

334
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,400
So and it didn't have any change at all, like less than 5%, more like 2 to 5%.

335
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,380
It was like, wow, you tripled it.

336
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,760
Still no change.

337
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,080
So in other words, if you put one or two or three in a chain, it doesn't matter, it still

338
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,680
does the same.

339
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,980
So that doesn't really add up, literally, right?

340
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,540
You know, that math ain't mathing, right?

341
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,820
So what's going on?

342
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,120
Well, it turns out that it's not necessarily how many devices you have in series, it's

343
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,920
what the relationship between the spool, the wraparound to the orbit around the magnetic

344
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,260
reactor, right?

345
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,480
So if you look at, for example, Saturn, the images of Saturn, you'll see the rings are

346
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,340
flat, pretty much go across the equatorial part of the planet, and they have different

347
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,260
colors and some bands are narrow, some bands are wide.

348
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,540
Vandy posted in the chat, different octaves in a circle.

349
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,680
So when you have a still body of water and you drop a pebble, you'll see how the ripples

350
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,280
go out.

351
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,540
Those are different, also represent, you might say, octaves to a degree, but the frequency

352
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,040
changes as it goes out, right?

353
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,380
Same thing with color and a rainbow.

354
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,560
More amplitude in the middle and less amplitude as it hits the shore, to a degree.

355
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,500
Same thing with color and a rainbow, right?

356
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,440
As you go out, the frequency of the color changes and it creates the different colors.

357
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,880
Yeah, there's a spectral element.

358
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,100
Spectral element, there you go.

359
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,400
Okay.

360
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,140
Element, yeah.

361
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,480
So we have noticed this, and the difference between going around once and having them

362
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,060
in series and the difference between going around twice and having just one unit is tremendous.

363
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,740
It is double.

364
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:37,220
In other words, the Gen 2, looping twice around, is what you would expect if you put two in

365
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,600
series.

366
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,720
So this is working on some other level, which we understand, we see it, because we're not

367
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,540
looking at this purely materialistically, we're looking energetically and we're looking

368
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,580
at it in a scalar form, you know, in terms of the elements as described.

369
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,280
Have you experimented with changing the nature of the orbit?

370
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,820
In other words, instead of a circular, you know, a proper circle, how about an ovoid

371
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,640
shape?

372
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,980
Would that change it?

373
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,920
Well, we want, yes and no.

374
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,700
Early on they were sort of ovoid, and because right now they're made with high precision,

375
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,180
we want to center the water flow over what's called the block wall, the inertial domain

376
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,500
where there is no magnetic field.

377
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,100
The part of the magnet is equidistant from the center, so it's going to have to be parallel

378
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,700
to the magnet.

379
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,180
And by the way, if you have a square magnet, it's still a circular magnetic field, right?

380
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,160
Regardless, you can do this, you know how with children they put the magnet under a paper

381
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
plate with metal shavings?

382
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:35,900
Oh, right.

383
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,540
And then you move the shavings.

384
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,560
And you see the donut shape?

385
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,180
Yeah, they have a game.

386
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,880
It doesn't matter what shape the magnet is, it'll always be a donut shape from the center

387
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,560
out, right?

388
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:42,840
Right.

389
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,520
And the edges will pull it in a little bit if it's a triangle or whatever, but not much.

390
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:46,980
Right.

391
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,380
Well, the reason why I was asking this is because, see, if you took, you know, two perfectly

392
00:23:51,380 --> 00:24:00,840
equal ovoid shapes and you displace them in equal distant ways, that would create a particular...

393
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,360
Yeah, it's a variation, but it actually, based on what we're chasing, which is the block

394
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,520
wall, it's a flat plane, that would be, having an elliptoid would be a distortion.

395
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,540
So we want to keep it as even as possible.

396
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,500
So around that, because it's the block wall that's doing it, and the block wall is equidistant,

397
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,820
so circular or concentric would be the way.

398
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,140
This is what I wanted to bring up.

399
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,740
People, whoever has interest, you know, I put out, these retail for 5k a piece.

400
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,800
And right now I have several of them that are first generation in hard cases, and they're

401
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,440
very precision made.

402
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,220
And what I'd like to do is auction them off.

403
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,080
In essence, it's Gen 1, and I'm going to auction them off.

404
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,420
So if you're interested in one, this is an opportunity to get a precision made by the

405
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,080
Greek Gen 1 Scalarator, without the hard case, I will not send it with the hard case, it'll

406
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,320
be packed, double boxed, in a nice package, but not with the hard case.

407
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,440
And it will be an opportunity for someone who is curious about getting one on an open bid.

408
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,400
So if you're interested, send me an email at uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com, that's

409
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,780
the numeric one, and tell me how, give me an offer, and if, what I'll do is very much

410
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,600
like a, because it's a bid, it's not a donation, after a certain amount of time with several

411
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,460
people, if they make offers, I will keep their names anonymous, I might use a first initial

412
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,280
or whatever, just so I can delineate a number, and email everyone who's put in a bid, these

413
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,100
are the bids.

414
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,120
So before I give it to the highest bidder, everyone has a chance to counterbid, at least

415
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,680
one time.

416
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,520
At least once.

417
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,520
Yeah.

418
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,940
This is not someone I spent, you're going to create a bidding war, no, not at all, because

419
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:04,580
I haven't, through the Greek-speak rated Y, I haven't gotten much request, a lot of interest,

420
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,080
but not request to acquire one.

421
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:14,180
So at this point, there's no starting cost, so whoever would like to get one, and of course,

422
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,860
the shipping, I always do priority shipping, because it's a flat rate, but if you're in

423
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,720
New Zealand or Australia, I don't know what it would be, so we could always work that

424
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,840
out as well, but no matter where you are, where you hear me, here's a chance to get

425
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,160
into a Gen 1, they're all one-inch diameter, 25.4 millimeter, and there's more to it.

426
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,460
These are specifically made for wells, or a one-inch pipe, okay?

427
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,080
So here's your chance, just put in a bid, whatever you think you'd like to send to acquire

428
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,660
one, I have several of these, and instead of what I was going to do, was take them apart

429
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,120
and salvage them, or rework them and add a piece with a connecting fitting to make them

430
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,640
a Gen 2.

431
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,540
It's just best to keep them Gen 1, and just get them out to whoever would like to acquire

432
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,800
one.

433
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,600
I know there are a couple of people that have been speaking on acquiring one, they just

434
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,820
don't have the funds at this time, they said, without making a ridiculous offer.

435
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,860
So no offer will be denied, any ridiculous offer is an offer, because I'm saying, this

436
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,980
is an open bid, right?

437
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,200
So this is a great chance to get, these are all the, by the way, these are not scratch

438
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,060
and dent and rejects, these are all the high-precision tested ones.

439
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,060
So I just wanted to put that out, so just email me, put in a bid, and I'll give it a

440
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,480
week or two, I'll collect them and I'll send you anonymously what all the bids are, because

441
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,540
obviously it goes to the highest bidder, right, so everyone has a second chance, or whatever.

442
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,480
I was thinking, I asked Sam, have you ever worked with eBay, I was putting them on eBay

443
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,800
and anyone who wants one can go there, and I'm like, why, let's just keep it, I think

444
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,540
we'll see what happens here first, right?

445
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,460
So I just wanted to put that out as like a public disservice announcement, right?

446
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,360
So if someone wanted to get one, here's a chance, right?

447
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,960
Because there's no pricing or anything here, there's no minimum or whatever, just put in

448
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,700
a bid by the email, which is UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com, numeric one, and that's it for

449
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,160
me, yeah.

450
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,100
All right, so that's all you want to talk about, about the Scalarator then?

451
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,680
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

452
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:38,060
I think it's a fair offering, there can't be any more fair than that, yeah.

453
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,940
I'll tell you, I think I would really, really love to get a full recap on the container soon,

454
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,160
like a refresher though, I think that would be a good idea.
