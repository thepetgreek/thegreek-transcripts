1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:15,780
Rated Y, Sonic Event 97, and here we are, and here you are, wherever you are, listening

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,440
to us.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,140
Anyway, do I want to get into that?

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,980
There's been a couple of new members that have joined over at the Patreon.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,120
Welcome to you.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,100
Happy to have you along.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,280
If you've gotten this far, I don't know if you're going to listen to 97 first and then

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,260
go back over the old stuff if you haven't already heard it, but a lot has been covered.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,220
Anyways, Greg, how are you doing tonight?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,440
Doing good.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,820
For anyone new or old or whatever, Greek speak has always been pre-calibrated for the lowest

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,820
common denominator.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,220
In civil engineering, when you design a highway off-ramp, the curve and the drop and the slope

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:57,060
and all that has to be for, let's say, a Ford Pinto or a car that's not a performance car,

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,540
like what would be the cheapest car you can buy with an 80-year-old driver?

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,300
Most likely, on average, the oldest people are when they're driving is around 80, 75,

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,660
80.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,760
You don't see too many 95 or 100.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,340
You have to design the off-ramp and on-ramp of a highway for the worst driver and the

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,000
worst car.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,500
That's allowable, typically, but not strictly because most ... What I'm saying is Greek

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,800
speak has always been pre-calibrated for that.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,020
In other words, if you give this to your mother-in-law, it's pretty clean or, let's say, your fourth-grade

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,380
teacher.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,000
It's clean enough and I bring up the topics.

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,640
Topics for, let's just say, not just me, others also that are on the sonic, will bring up

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,320
the topic in a very commonly, in a classically common way, let's just say that, classically

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,220
common, the way that they're used to hearing things brought up commonly.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,480
So you use common speak in order to make it accessible where you're going to go next, which

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,360
is uncommon.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,800
Answer.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,500
We'll pose a question in a way that we have the answer, but you should have the ... It's

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,820
kind of like when someone gives you something, you want to guess what it is.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
They wrap up something, what they call a gift.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,760
Hey, guess what?

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,160
Here.

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,620
Here.

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,120
This is for you, but guess what it is.

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,540
They used to do that more back in the days, right?

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, true.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
And the limitation immediately is, okay, so since you can hand it to me, it's clearly

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,580
not a car.

43
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Although there could be a set of keys in here.

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,600
It could be something like that.

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,180
Well, whatever.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,020
Yeah, just guess what it is.

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,720
But here's the thing.

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,380
Is it bigger than a bread box?

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Very rapidly, even though it's very common and easy to comprehend, remember comprehend,

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,240
is very rapidly it starts swinging.

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:49,620
It goes very, very deep, but with precaution, in other words, in steps, and it seems like

52
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,580
that's the filter moment.

53
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,940
That's the moment right there, and it's not ... I would say it's subtle enough that anyone

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,200
can listen to it, but once you show how simple it is, it's not easy for them.

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,340
I always say things are simple.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Just because something is simple doesn't mean it's easy, right?

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,860
Well, like when somebody takes a children's book, which is actually 10 pages long, and

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,660
tells you about the deeper meaning of it, you could take it on the surface level and

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,400
say, okay, it's three pigs, and here comes the wolf, whatever.

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,180
I'm just using that as an example, but there's a lesson.

61
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,040
No, actually, here, you should have the entire story on the illustration on the cover and

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,160
in pictures, right?

63
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,700
Because if you're writing something, the most important ... If you see pictures, illustrations,

64
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,080
the reason the effort was put into those is because they're important.

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,100
Of course.

66
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,240
Yeah, so the picture here ... Okay, there's a picture here to be painted constantly, and

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,540
it's about you, whoever you is, and where you are, and when you are, and that's basically

68
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,200
the simple thing.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,860
But basically, here, let's do a big tangent segue.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,860
I've been excited about what I've been preparing to eat for the past couple of months, maybe

71
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,300
less, but let's say a month and a half.

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,860
I've nicknamed these things cabbage pot roast, and the other one, the other dish is broccoli

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,620
steak, and it sounds just like, no, I didn't say pot roast and cabbage, and I didn't say

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,860
broccoli and steak.

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,160
It's cabbage pot roast and broccoli steak.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,220
Okay, so let's do ... I'm very excited because I'm actually preparing more.

77
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Before I get into it, I'm going through about two full, large heads of cabbage a week.

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,260
Most people buy cabbage, and it goes bad before they eat it, unless they're making coleslaw

79
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,540
for a party of 10, right?

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Right, okay.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,640
Or boiling up the whole thing for a big family.

82
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,520
This is basically the preparation, and you'll see why it's called pot roast and steak.

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,540
Very simple.

84
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,780
Very simple.

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,380
You've never been in a room when cabbage is being boiled or cooked that smells like baby

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,600
diapers, right, on occasion?

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Of course.

88
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,380
Same with broccoli.

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,280
A lot of greens do that.

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,120
Of course they do.

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,120
A lot of greens have this odd, foul, almost poop smell to them, but you know ...

92
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
No, no, they don't, actually.

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,420
They do, but it comes out because of the cooking process.

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,200
You take note of this a lot right around now because of St. Patrick's Day, right, in America.

95
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,280
That's the thing about it.

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,760
There's a meme.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,320
The Irish really know their drink, but the Greeks got much better food, right?

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,800
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,380
There you go.

100
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,500
Okay, so let's get into it.

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,460
So what you do is you go get a head of cabbage and you, let's say for two people, half a

102
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,660
head of cabbage, even large head is not that much, what you do is you cut it in half.

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,360
Try to cut it on an angle, so one will be a little bigger than the other, or three pieces

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,880
on an angle.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,660
And the root, don't cut against the root until you've cut your pieces, and if you cut a piece

106
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,660
and the root end happens to be there, carve around it and leave some of it intact.

107
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,980
Next thing you do is you get yourself a pot, a medium sauce pan that would be, a sauce pot

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,860
that would be the height of the cabbage, because you're going to need to seal it with a lid.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,460
So then what you do is you get some heat under that pot while it's dry, and I do butter.

110
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,540
I do a salted butter, an organic butter.

111
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,160
You don't have to do that if you don't want to use animal.

112
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,180
You can use sesame oil.

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,480
Don't use olive oil.

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
It's not high enough heat.

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,620
I was just going to ask about olive oil.

116
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,140
Okay, go ahead.

117
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,780
Any vegetable oil will do.

118
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,800
As you're warming the oil, add some caraway seeds.

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,760
The function of the caraway seed is to mitigate that baby diaper smell.

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,740
You will not get the baby diaper smell with caraway seeds.

121
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,420
Now what you do, as the caraway seeds are warming, the cut end of the cabbage that's

122
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,700
flat, hopefully it's flat, it goes against the bottom of the pot, and you press on it

123
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,980
a little bit, and just no water or anything, just let it come.

124
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,600
Basically, you're braising.

125
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,760
If you know what braising is, you're browning slightly.

126
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,460
Usually in a medium-sized pot, quality pot or so, we're talking about five minutes on

127
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,340
a medium heat, not high, depending on your pot.

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,220
When you start to see some braising, browning, you can move it around.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,080
Slight braising.

130
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,300
It doesn't have to be much.

131
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,740
You don't want to smoke it or burn it or fry it.

132
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,480
Just when it starts to harden, in other words, right?

133
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,020
Not harden, but caramelize.

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,480
Caramelize.

135
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,800
Okay.

136
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,560
You could lift it.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,040
It's kind of hard to see without lifting it out, which is difficult to lift it out.

138
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,560
On the side, you should have a kettle or something with some hot water.

139
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,100
By the way, never add room temperature or cold water to a pot that's hot, right?

140
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,860
It changes your cooking time, and it does all these other things, so you want to have

141
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,440
hot water.

142
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,820
If you're going to lift that out, would you use tongs, or would you use-

143
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,640
No, a spatula.

144
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,080
Two spatulas and a spatula and a fork.

145
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,460
Okay.

146
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,160
Spatula and a fork.

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah.

148
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,640
The tongs that would be big enough to pull it out were the kind that you see by a fireplace,

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,500
and they wouldn't fit.

150
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,100
Okay.

151
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,420
Because it's a big head.

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,760
Remember, it's a pretty large piece of cabbage we're talking.

153
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,340
We're not talking small pieces of cabbage.

154
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,200
If you cut a large head of cabbage in thirds, it's going to be at least two inches thick,

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,780
or if you cut it in half, it's going to be four inches thick, or three inches thick.

156
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,740
We're talking about heavy pieces here.

157
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
Not pieces.

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,540
Piece.

159
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,560
Single piece.

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,400
It's like when you're making a pot roast, it's a big hunk of meat, right?

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
It's not stew, where it's little pieces of meat, right?

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,220
Right.

163
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,520
There's a big hunk of cabbage.

164
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,820
You add your hot water until it's about three quarters of an inch or so above the bottom

165
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,960
of the pot, and you put a lid on it with some weight.

166
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,720
A pressure cooker would work well, but we have the DIY pressure cooker.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,419
You just have a good sealing lid, and you add some weights.

168
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,760
The weights could be ... I use diver weights, and a mug that's filled with concrete that

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,240
goes over the handle, which is three pounds in itself, and the diver weights are four

170
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,920
pounds each.

171
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,880
But anyway, you could use a brick wrapped in aluminum foil.

172
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,180
If you're going to use brick or rocks, wrap them in foil or something, because they do

173
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,540
crumble.

174
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:56,840
Right?

175
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,740
So it's like, hey, mommy, what's this crunchy stuff in here?

176
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,540
Oh, it's a rock.

177
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,600
How did a rock get in the pot?

178
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,020
Well, when you went to move it, a piece fell off into your pot, so I have it wrapped.

179
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,480
Seasoned with brick dust.

180
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,540
No, let's avoid that.

181
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah.

182
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,560
Wrap it in tin foil.

183
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:09,740
Yeah.

184
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,360
That's the song the gorillas have a song.

185
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,540
Like, hey, it's really crunchy.

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,780
Hey, that's a rock.

187
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,040
Right?

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,480
So anyway, so you're going to simmer that.

189
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,120
You can bring it up.

190
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,780
When you add your water, bring the temperature up.

191
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,680
You're not afraid of smoking or burning it, and you can put a lid on it.

192
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,760
Now, based on if the cabbage is room temperature or refrigerated, or how tender you want it

193
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,060
to be.

194
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,740
Now, I suggest when you start this out, make it really tender and mushy.

195
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,460
So it would be minimum 30 minutes on a pressure cook on the lid.

196
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,700
If you don't have a lid, it would be 45 a lid that fits with pressure.

197
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,340
It would be 40 minutes, at least 25 to 30 minutes with a pressurized top.

198
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,900
If you have a bonafide pressure cooker with a gasket and all that, 15 to 20 minutes, right?

199
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,160
And let it cool a little bit.

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,340
And then what you do is you lean, hold it, push it when you're done.

201
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,840
When it's done.

202
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,800
You know, a fork.

203
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,720
The way you know it's done is it's cooked all the way to the top.

204
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,640
And if you have a skewer or a fork, it should just go through with no resistance.

205
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
It should be completely fork tender.

206
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,460
So it might be 45 minutes for you if it came out of the fridge and you're new at this and

207
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
your pot is not the best.

208
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,100
Remember, the heavier pots have better heat transfer.

209
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,620
Better pots have better heat transfer.

210
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,700
Cheap culinary pots and stuff tend to burn things and undercook them at the same time,

211
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,780
believe it or not.

212
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:28,860
So.

213
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,980
So at this point, you want to make it as soft as possible where it still holds its shape.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,180
And at this point, you put a little bit of pressure on the top of the cabbage, either

215
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,480
with a kitchen towel or a spatula or a fork and lean the pot over sideways and pour all

216
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,080
the liquid out.

217
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,020
You want to do that.

218
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,860
So the reason you're pulling the liquid out and drain it before you remove the cabbage

219
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,220
is if the cabbage slips when you're removing, it doesn't splash down and you get hit with

220
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,740
hot liquid.

221
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,080
Right.

222
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,620
Mm hmm.

223
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,660
Remove the cabbage and put it in a preheated bowl, not a plate.

224
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Remember, it's round on the flat side up.

225
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,160
Now that liquid you can thicken with some cornstarch.

226
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,120
Add some cold corn in the pot, put it back in the pot and make a nice gravy with the

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,700
caraway seeds and the oil, the fat that was in there before.

228
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,720
You could add some garnish like parsley or some little bit of chopped, finely chopped

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,460
red onion or garlic that's been sauteed and then make your sauce.

230
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,180
And what you do is you serve it in a medium sized bowl and you give everyone who's part

231
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,700
eating a steak knife and they literally reach over their plate and with a steak knife, slice

232
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,600
a big hunk of this cabbage off, put it in their plate, put some of the gravy on it.

233
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,060
And it's just like eating pot roast, but it's cabbage and it's vegan, by the way, if you

234
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,760
don't use butter.

235
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,620
Right.

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,580
And it's so satisfying.

237
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,080
And you're like, wait a second.

238
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,760
This is supposed to be a side dish, not a main course.

239
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,740
And it's so very good now.

240
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,080
Cabbage from its medicinal purposes, even if you overcook it like this is really good for

241
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,900
skin recovery.

242
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,920
If you have burns or skin cancers, skin ailments, right, you do this for two or three weeks.

243
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,000
Any skin ailment, you have an acne or anything like that, unless you're a teenager, will

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,700
start to recover in a way that you, you know, like you're on your way to recovery.

245
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,660
The other thing that it's good for is it looks like your brain.

246
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,740
Right.

247
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,340
And why does it help brain function?

248
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, it also looks like your intestines.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
It's very soothing to the intestines.

250
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,600
Right.

251
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,520
And it'll normalize your bowel movement.

252
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,540
That's from the medicinal side and the yin and yang side also adding some parsley to

253
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,100
it, which is an upper growth leaf or carrot tops balances that even even really well.

254
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,020
If you want to go more on the Japanese style, if you want to make something delicious, if

255
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,880
you have umeboshi plum or umeboshi plum vinegar, break off little pieces of umeboshi plum into

256
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,100
your gravy or you can have some umeboshi plum vinegar.

257
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,380
I think I've gotten into umeboshi plum now before.

258
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,140
Now, that's the cabbage pot roast.

259
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,020
And when I say cabbage pot roast, I mean it's cabbage as pot roast.

260
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
There's no pot roast involved.

261
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,380
It is the pot roast.

262
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,220
And it's so satisfying by itself.

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,700
You can have it with a side tonight.

264
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm making that and I'm having it with some fried fish on the side.

265
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Right.

266
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,780
Give you an example.

267
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,960
And that turns out to be a satisfying enough centerpiece for your for your meal.

268
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Really?

269
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,640
Absolutely.

270
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,120
If you cook it this way.

271
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,740
If you go the traditional route and have cabbage prepared how it's typically prepared.

272
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,300
No, it won't be satisfying at all.

273
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,620
No, even if you shred it up raw and you do stuff like that, even like every traditional

274
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,520
recipe, you see cabbage chopped up in large pieces, small pieces, shredded, cooked, steamed,

275
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,380
boiled, stewed, raw.

276
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,020
This has absolutely nothing to do with that.

277
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,120
This is like you are imitating a pot roast, except it's cabbage and just cabbage.

278
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,460
It is so satisfying.

279
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,740
Try it.

280
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,940
It's all about the cut.

281
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,820
Like when you're cooking, if you cut something, the cut changes the flavor.

282
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,140
You have done this years ago when I talked about cooking.

283
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,900
Most of the people who disagreed came back and found it agreeable.

284
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:11,580
If you take a carrot, a well grown, organic, ripe carrot and start cutting it in different

285
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,980
varieties, like really thin on a bias, thin on end, grate it, dice it, make shoestrings.

286
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,220
I want you to taste each piece of that same carrot with a different cut.

287
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,740
You will notice the carrot will taste different based on its cut.

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,340
The cut is actually something.

289
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,200
That's why when all these chefs started becoming, chef shows, cooking shows started becoming

290
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,620
popular in the 1990s and they followed all the way through the 2000s, I always pointed

291
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,020
at the TV and told people, you will never learn how to cook watching these cooking shows.

292
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,360
Never.

293
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,540
And I'm right.

294
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,280
No one's ever watched those and learned how to cook because they never get into the fine

295
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,260
points of what really affects the final effect, quality and satisfaction of a meal.

296
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:02,060
This is strictly just, if you deviate and you start cutting cabbage into pieces, it will

297
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,720
not work.

298
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,200
It has to be cooked whole or half.

299
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,420
It has.

300
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:06,860
Right?

301
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,220
Okay.

302
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,040
And if you had a pot big enough, I wouldn't put a big round globe of cabbage in there.

303
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I would still cut it in half because there's something about exposing the inside to the

304
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,480
braising.

305
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,420
Remember?

306
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,380
So basically you're braising the cut end of the cabbage, adding some water, pressure cooking

307
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,160
it, making a gravy with the liquid, and you're eating it like it's a roast, just like you

308
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,500
would serve a roast in a bowl.

309
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,700
You don't want to serve it on a plate because you can have the gravy, whatever.

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,360
So it doesn't always pre-heat your plates.

311
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,900
Doesn't some of that liquid feed up into the rest of the cabbage though?

312
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,280
Yeah.

313
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,480
Well, it actually releases liquid.

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,240
So if you put an inch of liquid in there, by the time it's done, you'll still have an

315
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,480
inch of liquid unless the heat is high enough.

316
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,960
I've once got a little overly confident and I wanted it to be like a thick au jus of cabbage

317
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,460
and I burned the cabbage almost.

318
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,680
I immediately took it out of the pot and put it in another pot, but it had a nice, very

319
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
dark braise on it.

320
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,720
It was still good.

321
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,460
The same thing happens with the broccoli.

322
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,880
When you get a head of broccoli, usually when you buy a large head of broccoli, it's three

323
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
large stems.

324
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,400
Typically you'll see like one stem.

325
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,020
Stem would be coming off the stalk at least three quarters of an inch or more wide.

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,560
You cut that off.

327
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,900
It's about the size of an adult fist, maybe bigger.

328
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,380
What you do with the broccoli is get yourself a peeler, like a potato peeler, and grab that

329
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,060
stem and start peeling that stem like it's a cube cut.

330
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,480
Peel the skin off of that stem.

331
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,160
We're talking about a stem that's about an inch in diameter, right?

332
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,860
You want the skin off of that stem because that's really tough.

333
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,640
Then what I want you to do on that stem is cut off if it's dry because you got it at

334
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,280
the supermarket.

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,820
Cut the dry part piece off about a quarter of an inch to expose the fresh, fleshy part

336
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,360
of the vegetable.

337
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Then I want you to, as you're facing the stem, get a knife and cut a cross into it one way

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,460
and then the other just to split it.

339
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,840
Cut into it all the way just shy of the florets.

340
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,920
If you have some thick florets with thick stems, stick the blade into those thick stems

341
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,359
just to open them up a little bit.

342
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,579
In this case, there's no braising.

343
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,980
You start off with a little bit of water.

344
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,819
I would say, depending on how big your pot is, you want about a quarter inch of water

345
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,520
or less.

346
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,940
Get it hot.

347
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,460
Put your broccoli in there.

348
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,940
A little sprinkle of salt.

349
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,660
Put the lid on.

350
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,060
That doesn't take about seven minutes.

351
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,340
Depending if it came out of the fridge, it might be 10 or 12 minutes.

352
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,200
If it's room temp or you pulled it out of the garden, it'll be about seven minutes or

353
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,400
so.

354
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
You want it tender again.

355
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,940
You don't want it to be crunchy.

356
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,340
You could say, if you do this right, because there's no spices or herbs in this, you should

357
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,960
not get that baby diaper smell, number one.

358
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,460
Number two, when you do it right, there should be no liquid at the bottom of the pan when

359
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,540
you're done, or the pot.

360
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,480
Sorry, it would be a pot, because it won't fit in a pan.

361
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
If you lean a crown of broccoli in a pot, it's at least three or four inches tall.

362
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,340
Again, you're not cutting this into pieces.

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,540
If you misinterpret what I'm saying and start cutting the cabbage and the broccoli into

364
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,920
pieces, you're done fucked up.

365
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,420
Oops, sorry.

366
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,500
Medical term.

367
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
You're done screwed up.

368
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,060
This is not what I'm talking about.

369
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,500
It will not taste anything like this at all.

370
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,280
When you get the broccoli out, typically a lot of times when you do this in a restaurant

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,480
or whatever, you want to stop the cooking by putting the broccoli or the vegetable

372
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,720
in ice water, because it still keeps cooking.

373
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,860
As a matter of fact, when you cook meat or steak, I didn't believe this until I tested

374
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,840
it myself, when you measure the temperature of a steak on the grill and then remove it

375
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,040
from the grill, no matter if it's medium well or rare, when you put it on a plate right

376
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,000
next to the grill, you'll notice the temperature of the steak slightly rises, and you're like,

377
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,880
how is that possible?

378
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,360
It's off the fire.

379
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,660
Why did the temperature go up?

380
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,480
Well, because of the contraction, right?

381
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,300
All the juices get dumped in the plate, and that's why you always have to let a steak

382
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,400
rest, and then it sucks the juices back up, right?

383
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,420
So anyway, that's meat.

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,260
So anyway, with the broccoli, if you do this perfectly and you make adjustments just right,

385
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,440
you should have no liquid in the bottom of the pot, right?

386
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,500
And then you serve that.

387
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,060
Now, when you put that in a bowl also, you don't want it on a plate.

388
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,720
You want it in a bowl, something with a high side, because it's going to roll around.

389
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,080
Remember, this is about minimum four inches tall, right?

390
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,940
It's a crown of broccoli.

391
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Again, do not cut any pieces off.

392
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,740
You could cut into it.

393
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,720
Remember, peeling the skin off of the main stem, or if you have any thicker stems.

394
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,640
If the stems are bigger than your forefinger or thumb, you should get the peeler in there

395
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
and get that skin off of it.

396
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Now, once you put this into a bowl, preheated bowl, there's many ways to preheat.

397
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,720
When you serve food, if it's a hot dish, you should preheat your bowls, by the way.

398
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,920
So when people are sitting around and you're eating it, the dish is warm until it, right?

399
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,240
Food doesn't get cold as fast, right?

400
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,900
Okay, so as soon as it comes out of the pot and you're ready to serve it, sprinkle some

401
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,000
vinegar on there, either umeboshi plum vinegar or red wine vinegar or rice vinegar, a little

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,580
acidity.

403
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,400
If you don't have vinegar, you could use a little bit of lemon or lime.

404
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,000
Lime might be preferable to lemon, because lemon imparts too much of a flavor sometimes.

405
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:21,340
And a little bit of olive oil, or your favorite eating salad oil, or salad dressing on it.

406
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,320
And then I serve that with a blue cheese dressing, or it's nice to serve this with a creamy dressing.

407
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,880
You can also make a dressing, I call it cheatin' cheddar, which is equal parts miso to equal

408
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,420
parts tahini, which is sesame paste.

409
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,680
A lot of people like a slightly, like a mildly altered ranch even dressing, right?

410
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,360
Yeah, I'm not a fan of ranch, but yeah, I'd rather do blue cheese than ranch.

411
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,000
But yeah, blue cheese, it's very rich, so anyway.

412
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,080
Get to the point.

413
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,640
And what you do is you serve this with steak knives, you know, the serrated steak knives.

414
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,240
And when you're ready to eat it, you reach over your plate into where this is, and you

415
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,340
cut yourself a floret, or you cut yourself a hunk of broccoli.

416
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,460
And you put some sauce, either the cheatin' cheddar, which is equal parts miso and tahini.

417
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,400
You can make a ginger carrot sauce.

418
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,700
Dip it in there, and you'll be like, this is like eating steak.

419
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,280
Broccoli is not just a side dish.

420
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,180
This is a main course.

421
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,180
Seriously.

422
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,120
I mean, it is a main course.

423
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,120
I call it broccoli steak, and it works out really well.

424
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,500
But people might say, hey, Greg, I've had broccoli before.

425
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,240
It's nothing like that.

426
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,160
Yeah, I know you've had broccoli before, or something like, because it wasn't prepared

427
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,540
this way.

428
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,760
Once you change the way it's prepared, it will change the thing itself, right?

429
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,060
It's very, very interesting, how this works.

430
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,700
This further reinforces a lot of the subtle points that I tend to think are more significant

431
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,580
and are left out.

432
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,060
The cut affects the end result and the flavor, you know, very much so.

433
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,220
Like imagine coleslaw.

434
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,060
Very finely shredded cabbage, very finely shredded, maybe some carrot for color.

435
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,500
Some cultures, like German, they don't put carrot in there, whatever.

436
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,760
Could you imagine a coleslaw made if the cabbage was cut into square chopped pieces and chopped

437
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
large pieces of carrot?

438
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,980
It wouldn't be, and he used even the same recipe with dressing.

439
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,020
It wouldn't resemble coleslaw.

440
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,020
It wouldn't taste like coleslaw at all, because the cut now is right.

441
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,260
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

442
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,060
I've had something like that before, where it's like a cabbage salad.

443
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,820
Oh, sorry to hear that.

444
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,040
Yeah, well, unfortunately, I could sit here and tell you horror stories about how, you

445
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,200
know, women in my age group.

446
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,360
There's 300 million horror stories about to happen at dinner time in America right now.

447
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:38,600
Right.

448
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,680
Maybe not that many.

449
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,380
What is it?

450
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,620
About 250 million horror stories are going to happen tonight.

451
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,880
That's probably, well, 200, let's just call it 200 million, just to be even about it.

452
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,100
Yeah.

453
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,460
So, you know what I mean.

454
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,000
The thing is, exactly.

455
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,900
I don't want to say it's white people, but you know.

456
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,040
Well, yeah, but I mean, pretty much I dated white women, and the truth is that white women

457
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,340
often would attempt to cook something, and yeah, I got stuff like this from some of them.

458
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,500
And I'm like, yeah, I don't know what this is, but, you know.

459
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,200
We'll try it.

460
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,580
Yeah.

461
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,140
We'll give it a shot.

462
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,040
There's no reason for it.

463
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,200
Yeah.

464
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,240
We've got into why white people can't cook.

465
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,620
Yeah.

466
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,680
And it's a cultural thing.

467
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
It's a cultural thing.

468
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,920
It's not their fault, really.

469
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,880
It's just kind of.

470
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,300
Yeah.

471
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,680
It's kind of like you go to certain parts on the continent of Africa, they eat crickets

472
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,400
and bugs, and they actually don't taste too bad.

473
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,140
It's kind of like, I want to say chicken.

474
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,020
It would taste like, you ever have a, get fried chicken, and a piece of the skin falls

475
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,800
off with the batter.

476
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,240
Right.

477
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,280
It kind of tastes more like that than the chicken itself.

478
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,840
But anyway.

479
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,420
Understood.

480
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:36,860
Yeah.

481
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,500
Okay.

482
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,680
So here's a couple of quick questions for you, though, because I take note of the fact

483
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,900
that you mentioned both times.

484
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,280
You made it a key mention that you use a steak knife, okay, to.

485
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,280
That's right.

486
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Because you're cutting through a hunk of vegetable.

487
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,840
That's right.

488
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
A big hunk of vegetable.

489
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,200
A hunky vegetable.

490
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:53,680
Right.

491
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah.

492
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,920
Serrated makes it easier.

493
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,960
Serrated makes it easier.

494
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,080
Is it just for ease, or is there some other reason why we use a steak knife?

495
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,300
No, no.

496
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,960
It's for ease, because you're eating broccoli steak, or broccoli shtake.

497
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,560
Shtake.

498
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:04,800
Okay.

499
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,220
It's not a side dish anymore.

500
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,780
These veggies, you can eat them as a main course, and they are so satisfying and delicious.

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,860
And your bowels will thank you.

502
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,420
You know, I mean, like now, like, you know, people go out and buy broccoli.

503
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,540
They'll get some broccoli for like a family of four at a last, you know, whatever.

504
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,280
You know, no one goes out and buys a head of cabbage, you know, lives alone or lives with someone.

505
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,280
Let's say it's two people.

506
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,740
You say, this will be gone by tomorrow.

507
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,240
No one eats like that, right?

508
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,040
Or a big thing of broccoli, like, this will be gone by tomorrow.

509
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
I mean, no one eats that much broccoli or cabbage, but you can.

510
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,360
Of course you can.

511
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,200
And it's really good.

512
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,420
It's really satisfying.

513
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,740
And it's not like, and you get this energy boost.

514
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,760
And it's not a matter of eating raw.

515
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,200
You want to cook this well.

516
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,960
Not well done too much.

517
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,620
You want, when you start off with the-

518
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm not eating broccoli raw.

519
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,840
Broccoli raw is great in a salad.

520
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,600
You know, honestly, if you chop it up.

521
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,340
It can be, but the quantity of plastic teeth in my mouth is increasing.

522
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,440
I understand.

523
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,380
Yeah.

524
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,880
So, you know, like what I mean by plastic teeth is like you ever try to have a meal with plastic utensils.

525
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,680
You can do it, but you just got to be, you know, remember you're using plastic utensils.

526
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,000
I'd be careful about that.

527
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,260
Yeah.

528
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,580
You could break your plastic.

529
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah.

530
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,300
So here's the thing.

531
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,240
The broccoli do not, the cabbage, go ahead and overcook what you consider overcooked.

532
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,460
Not too much, but it should still hold its shape.

533
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,380
If you open the lid back to the cabbage and it's flattened out, you cooked it too much.

534
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,040
It should still retain its shape, but it should be completely fork tender.

535
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,300
When you push the fork through, it should have almost no resistance.

536
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,600
The broccoli should not overcook.

537
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,300
It should resemble a very bright green color.

538
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,200
If you have a tendency to overcook, you might have a bowl of, or a bath of ice water that you dunk it in to stop it from cooking.

539
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,840
But there's something about it being served hot.

540
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,480
So if it's slightly undercooked, it's fine.

541
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:58,440
Because remember, you've already used a potato peeler or a vegetable peeler to remove most of the skin on the thick stalks.

542
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,500
Because that's what makes the broccoli tough to chew.

543
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,840
Not the inner juicy part, the flesh of the stalk.

544
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,160
It's the outer part of the stalk.

545
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,420
The outer part of the stalk is the part that's too chewy.

546
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:07,780
That's hard.

547
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,520
That's right.

548
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,160
So you remove that as much as possible.

549
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,920
And if you're going up against the floret, use a small blade.

550
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
Like the peel will pull off, but it won't come off too easy.

551
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,760
So you just tap it with a blade and remove it.

552
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,600
Very thick stalks, split them also with a knife.

553
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:29,520
So the reason I'm stressing this, and I can't stress it enough, is that these vegetables are the main course.

554
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,600
And they are very, very satisfying, especially if you have a flavorful side.

555
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,220
Condiment.

556
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,720
I've always got time to talk about condiments too.

557
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,180
But if you have a flavorful condiment, it could be your favorite condiment, or you could whip up something rich.

558
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,120
Don't be afraid.

559
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
Don't go bland on your condiments.

560
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,120
Go strong.

561
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,980
I'm not talking ketchup and mustard here, right?

562
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,660
Those are meat-eater condiments.

563
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,400
So what we're talking here now is, by the way, the reason I'm putting this out to people who have children, I want some feedback.

564
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,300
Because at this point, I'm not associating with anyone that has children.

565
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,500
In the past, I knew some couples that had young children, and I would suggest certain things.

566
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,740
And you're typically making a certain dish, and you're like, oh, children are never going to eat that.

567
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,360
And the response that I got back was they loved it, right?

568
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,440
Well, aside from me.

569
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
You actually have me.

570
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,020
I have a nine-year-old.

571
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,920
Right.

572
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,380
So do this with the cabbage.

573
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,420
And do this with the broccoli as a main dish.

574
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,880
But if you just serve – if you look like you're in the Disney things back in the 30s when they were poor in a shack and they had a pea.

575
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,460
Remember, everybody's got to split this pea.

576
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,440
Don't be pathetic about this.

577
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,000
If you do the cabbage or the broccoli, make sure you have at least one or two condiments on the side.

578
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,080
It's like a sauce of some kind to dip it.

579
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,780
You can make a peanut sauce.

580
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,540
It goes really well.

581
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,220
Peanut sauces are very easy to do.

582
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,160
One part peanut butter, two parts water.

583
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,500
And then to the water, add a little bit of sugar, fish sauce, sriracha, some other flavor.

584
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,680
You could add some bouillon, a little bit of vinegar, soy sauce.

585
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,140
And as you heat – when you put the peanut butter in the water and you start bringing it to a simmer, peanut butter starts to try to dissolve.

586
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,680
And then suddenly it gets thick.

587
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,780
Because peanut butter is actually a thickener, just like cornstarch would be.

588
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,020
And you add a little more water and flavor it up.

589
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,140
Add some sweetener, add some acid, vinegar, lime juice.

590
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,120
Don't cook the lime juice.

591
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,900
Add it in the end if that's all you have.

592
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,320
Add some soy sauce.

593
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,300
I do fish sauce.

594
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,540
The fish sauce is made from fermented anchovies.

595
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,600
But it's really delicious.

596
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,040
If you make Thai food, it's an essential.

597
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,580
Look, some people might enjoy that.

598
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,580
But you know what?

599
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,260
I want to –

600
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Well, not by itself.

601
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,000
Some people just like to eat anchovies.

602
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,020
He was just into that.

603
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,060
But this is different.

604
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,640
This is fermented anchovies.

605
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,000
I understand.

606
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,800
This smells worse than any panties you can imagine.

607
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,600
Of course it does.

608
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,980
Did I just say that?

609
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,440
You did.

610
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,760
Anyhow, what I was going to say, though, is that commonly what used to be with broccoli and with cauliflower both – because I was going to ask about that, by the way.

611
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,300
Could you interchange this with cauliflower?

612
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,980
Yeah.

613
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,820
The cauliflower, I would do the broccoli steak.

614
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,300
I wouldn't do the cabbage.

615
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,780
Cabbage is – remember, there's no braising with the –

616
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,080
I'm confused.

617
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:18,480
The cauliflower would be strictly like the broccoli including the peeler on the stalks because the same thing would happen there.

618
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,040
OK.

619
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,160
But the – so you have the cabbage and you have – right.

620
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,640
And this is in series.

621
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,240
This is a continuing series.

622
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,480
Let me just do a little segue and a tangent and we'll end.

623
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,900
One of the things that – one of my favorite foods ever, there was a small chain in New York back in the late 70s and 80s that had baked potatoes.

624
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,960
That's all they had, right?

625
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,520
Oh, yeah.

626
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,100
So it was baked potato with a list.

627
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,940
The menu had 30 things.

628
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,780
The 30 items were toppings, right?

629
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,260
Wait a minute.

630
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,300
There was a couple of those kind of places and one of them was like a knockoff of the other, wasn't it?

631
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,280
And it was –

632
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,660
Yeah.

633
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,760
They were in the Fulton Mall in Brooklyn and all that.

634
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,540
Anyway, some in Jersey, some in Connecticut.

635
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,760
One of them had like some kind of cutesy name or something, right?

636
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,520
Sure, sure.

637
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,860
Yeah, Spuds, whatever, something.

638
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,740
But it was great because it was – Wendy's, you can still get a baked potato with chili or whatever.

639
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,560
It's a really good thing.

640
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,600
So I was like, man, baked potatoes, man, that's a lot of energy.

641
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,980
So I said, why don't we boil – let's do it all stovetop, right?

642
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:12,620
Oh, yeah.

643
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,640
You can still make something that is like a baked potato without firing up an oven.

644
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,740
And I developed the stovetop baked method.

645
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,880
And I think we had Joe.

646
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,100
He doesn't mind me using it.

647
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,200
He loved it.

648
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,600
He shared it with his wife and that's how she made it because they like baked – now you can have baked potatoes in 20 minutes, half hour.

649
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,600
You could make it all on the stovetop with a little burner, right?

650
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
And it's just like a baked potato.

651
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,760
Right.

652
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,720
Anytime I bring up food, even when I have Joe on another show or something to talk about other stuff, if I bring up food, he always brings up the stovetop potatoes.

653
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,160
Yeah, they're great.

654
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,040
You use so little energy, right?

655
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,860
And you get a baked potato because who doesn't like a baked potato?

656
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,400
And I'm talking about a bonafide baked potato with the skin on.

657
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:59,200
When you're ready to serve it, you score the top and you squeeze it and then all the starch pops up and it's steamy and you've got that real strong potato flavor.

658
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,480
And then you dress it 100 different ways like you were talking about at that restaurant.

659
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,660
Sure, but what I'm saying is – remember, this is stovetop.

660
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,840
It has nothing to do with boiled potatoes.

661
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,840
It doesn't taste like a boiled potato at all if you follow the instructions.

662
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,800
So this is a segue.

663
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,920
So now – because a baked potato to me is a main – I don't eat it.

664
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,700
It's not a side.

665
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,920
To me, if I'm going to have dinner, baked potato is fine.

666
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,300
I'll just have a nice toppings on it and that's good, right?

667
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:30,000
So this is the same thing as that with the cabbage, braised cabbage and with the cauliflower.

668
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm glad you brought that up because cauliflower is basically albino broccoli, right?

669
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,240
And you would treat the cauliflower exactly like you do the broccoli.

670
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,820
And I recommend going through this Sonic.

671
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,760
We'll try to keep it short.

672
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:48,880
So if someone wants to go back and repeat step by step, we did the cabbage first and then the broccoli and then the addendum of the cauliflower.

673
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:58,340
Right, and look, I just got one last question and that is when you were talking about these sauces and adding a savory sauce, cheese might be one of the first things to go for.

674
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,160
And in fact, somebody sent me this email recently asking about what kind of seafood you would recommend.

675
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,060
You see food and you eat it, yeah.

676
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,480
Yeah, that would be most proper.

677
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,260
Of course, they were talking about –

678
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,600
Anything that lives in water should have fins and scales.

679
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,720
A quick example of what doesn't have fins and scales are crustacea, shrimp, lobster.

680
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,860
But then you have fish like shark and catfish.

681
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,840
They have fins but they don't have scales.

682
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,180
Right?

683
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,380
But you wouldn't eat a shark or a catfish then?

684
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,640
Well, it doesn't qualify, no.

685
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
Okay, fair enough.

686
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,300
Because it has fins but it doesn't have scales, right?

687
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,720
Catfish has skin and shark has bone.

688
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,760
So last thing that that email observed though is that quite often the Greek doesn't seem to be a fan of cheese.

689
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,500
But I was thinking to myself what would go –

690
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,760
I am actually, but I live in America.

691
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,360
The milk here is – if you want good cheese, you have to get it in Europe because they don't have strict milk laws, right?

692
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,500
That's right, right.

693
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Okay, fair enough.

694
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,900
By the way, even if you live in the U.S., where are the best cheeses?

695
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,160
They'll say Wisconsin but you get European cheeses, right?

696
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,680
They're 30 bucks a pound, right?

697
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,700
Yeah, best cheeses are going to be what you can import and usually –

698
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,500
From France, yeah.

699
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,280
Where does the best parm come from?

700
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,500
Yeah, you get those on the coast.

701
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:13,740
Italy.

702
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,760
Honestly, you get it in America, you find it in New York, you find it in California because there's –

703
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,240
There's a huge difference in the complexity of flavor.

704
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,680
Right, so if your cheese came across on a boat, maybe you got a shot at having a decent cheese.

705
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,080
You definitely have a decent cheese because they – yeah.

706
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,460
Right.

707
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,140
Even when they know they send the crap over and they keep the best in Europe.

708
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,660
That's still going on by the way.

709
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,480
The car – like I know someone who was in – I knew someone a while back.

710
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,240
I was communicating with him.

711
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,100
Big fan of Audi and he lives here in the States and he got an Audi but he had it shipped.

712
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,760
He went over to Austria, wherever they make them.

713
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
He drove it for a week.

714
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,060
You want to drive it for a week because if you don't, then they will charge you the new car tax, right?

715
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,740
Right, right.

716
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,540
Then he had it shipped over.
