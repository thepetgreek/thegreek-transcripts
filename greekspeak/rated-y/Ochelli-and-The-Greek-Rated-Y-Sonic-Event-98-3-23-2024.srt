1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:18,900
Hey, Sonic Event 89 on Rated Y, no, not 89, whoops, 98, other way around, either way it'll

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,680
be similar.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,940
It will be similar.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,920
It could be similar.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,920
Often things are similar like that.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,060
So Greek, you know, I would ask you how you're doing, but instead I'm going to go at you

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,820
with a question that I got on Facebook, of all places.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,260
That's how I'm doing.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,620
Just hit me up with the questions.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,700
Even if you ask me how I'm doing, it's not a question.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,380
It is.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,360
Anyway, go ahead.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Sure.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,420
But this one came from a sub on Facebook, a subscriber on Rated Y, but they sent me

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,200
in the message via Facebook for some reason.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,060
Anyway, they wanted to know about what is actually in the biblical text regarding the process

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,660
of death.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
And I know we've discussed this before, but I think...

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,600
But I have to preface, because I haven't been doing this a lot.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,840
Biblical text that we have that people read, we in any country, is a version.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,880
What's memorialized in the scriptures you'll find very different.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:19,960
But the reason I got into this, big but, is because I had no desire, you know, if anyone

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,740
said they had a Bible, I was like, ah, it's, you know, written by Shakespeare or whatever.

24
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,900
So I was like, wait, how can I knock it if I've never really read it or even studied

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,260
it, right?

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,480
It's kind of like watching a trailer of a movie and saying it's a bad movie, right?

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,400
You can usually.

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,260
But anyway, I started studying scripture and I found out what was in the Bible was not talked

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:46,240
about in religious circles, in churches, whatever, synagogues, or even in public or in memes

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,640
or cliches.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,140
And what they're talking about is not in the Bible.

32
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,680
So it's like, ooh, wait a second, it seems like everybody missed this.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,420
So that's the reason why I got into it.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,680
But it is the order of things that anybody who, you know, basically clings to a text

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
and says that this is their Bible, and by the way, they use the word their Bible, their

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,060
book to mean a lot of things.

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,300
Yeah, but they don't know anything in it.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,979
They never know anything that's in it.

39
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,340
It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,400
Even when somebody says, you know, look, I'm in whatever, name an industry, and they say,

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,260
this is my Bible, you know, and it's some instructional manual or it's something else.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, the federal people, they see the U.S. codes, and they don't, they never even read

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,920
the definitions.

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,080
And they don't know what it means.

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
Anyway, even if they know the codes, they have no idea what they mean.

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,780
Yeah, but the definitions undoes most of the codes when it comes to the general population.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,680
There you go.

48
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,140
It only applies to those that work for the executive.

49
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,580
All right, give me an example.

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,660
The last general order, I think, was 1871, you know, executive general order.

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,520
It was Order 100, General Order 100, and that was the last time there was an order put out.

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,460
But all of the other ones are called executive orders, and those are for people that are

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,320
employees of the executive branch.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,440
And they could apply to other branches, meaning the judicial and legislative also.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,160
So when, right now, if you watch television, the President of the United States says, putting

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,620
out an executive order, everyone thinks it applies to them.

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,840
Well, it only applies to whoever's working for the executive branch as an employee of

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,780
the executive branch.

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,260
It doesn't apply to the general population.

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,960
But general orders do, like General Order 100, which is the Lieber Code.

61
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,760
It's the orders for the army in the field, because they pretty much decided that they're

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,500
going to use the army to control the population from then on.

63
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,300
But anyway, anyway, so anyway, if you go out telling this to people, they'll think you're

64
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,620
crazy.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,180
You know, executive order applies to me.

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,300
Yeah, you're crazy.

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
Everybody knows that, you see?

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,460
No, the executive order came...

69
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,820
Biblical stuff is exactly the same way.

70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,880
Yeah, it came down from the President, and therefore he said, and here's the funny part

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,400
about that, is that even the people that tout that and say that and say that it applies

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,460
to them, they never read that either.

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,860
I find that they never read the executive order, even if they know of an executive order.

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,500
They know the number of it and everything else.

75
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,980
They never read that either, which is really funny.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,760
But even if you read it, do you comprehend its application?

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,540
Give me an example.

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,240
All of the codes, even the local ones, apply to persons, corporations, trusts, et cetera.

79
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,240
Now, if you look up a person, a person is either a corporation or a trust.

80
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,220
Right?

81
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,760
It doesn't say people anywhere.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,420
So none of that really applies to you, unless...

83
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,520
That's why when people complain to the Attorney General, you know, why did you railroad this

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,580
guy in a mistrial or whatever, you know, whatever, you didn't get a fair trial.

85
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,100
He says, well, he agreed to everything we said.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,180
It's a contract, right?

87
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,420
So yeah, but if you go out and start...

88
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,040
You can only do this, by the way, if you're dealing with a judiciary or any administrative

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,480
office.

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,780
You cannot do this publicly.

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,160
It's best to do it privately, because there is someone there that knows.

92
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,820
Give me an example.

93
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,700
Most of the people that work for the executive branch don't know what I just said.

94
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,080
They don't know it.

95
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,380
But there's someone in there that does, high up on the ladder, right?

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,460
So making it public to the people that work, even work for the executive branch, isn't going

97
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,200
to get you anywhere.

98
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,600
In other words, if you understand something that's been codified, because the Bible's

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,960
codified also, I'm using that in a literal sense, and if you bring this up to someone

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,880
who supposedly subscribes to it, whether it's the Bible or the codes or the laws, and they

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,700
don't understand what you're saying or don't see it immediately or agree with it, you're

102
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,360
too low on the totem pole, right?

103
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,140
So that's why a lot of these patriots, whatever, we'll get back to the question.

104
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,680
You know, they try to talk to the police officers about the law.

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,380
Oh, my God, those guys are handing out contracts, right?

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,540
They don't know anything.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,940
As a matter of fact, it's very well established that if you score too high, right, on aptitude

108
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,460
tests for becoming an officer, what do they say?

109
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,160
No, we won't hire you.

110
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,740
And the reason they gave, the semi-official reason they gave is because, oh, you won't

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,200
be interested.

112
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,700
You'll be bored by the job, right?

113
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,620
That was the reason.

114
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,580
I don't know if you remember that.

115
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,740
So the same thing goes with the biblical text.

116
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,800
Now, the biblical text, the other reason I got into it is because it seems to be what

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,160
is the anchor for law, culture, morality, and ethics for the Western world.

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,240
And of the Islam also, because the Koran does say, you look at the laws of Moses, right?

119
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Well, and they have an arranged, digest, or systematic collection, which is the definition

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,960
of codified, right?

121
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,720
So they do have these things arranged in a...

122
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,600
It not only is no one really discussing what's in the Bible and what they discuss is not in

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:54,720
the Bible, even in the versions, even if you aren't as strict, let's say pedantic and conservative

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,600
as I am to go and look at the original, what was preserved in Hebrew or Greek before it

125
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,820
was turned into a version.

126
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,300
Even if you don't do that, reading the versions will clearly show you very much a mirror of

127
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,160
what's in the original.

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,100
You make a lot of mistakes, but you still end up with a very similar product.

129
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,920
The product being how you should think about it.

130
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,260
And again, just to repeat myself, basic world ethics, commerce, you know, a lot of commercial

131
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,180
stuff, ethical stuff, moral stuff, it comes out of the Bible.

132
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,740
So it's an important thing to know.

133
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,200
And let's go back to the question.

134
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,260
The process of death we've gotten, which we will get into the container again, is when

135
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,920
the soul dies, then the body, the container starts to go into decay and then the spirit

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,480
leaves that situation because the body is made up of the soul, which is the metabolism

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,840
that runs the body, like the gas in the car, the oil in the car, right?

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,420
No gas or no oil in the car, it doesn't run.

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,780
And then the car decays because it doesn't run.

140
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,560
And the spirit is the computer in the car, right?

141
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,480
So there's nothing much in that process, actually.

142
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,460
I don't know if it's been redacted.

143
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,280
Yeah, I was going to say it's also the breath, though, when you say spirit, right?

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,300
I mean, yeah, well, no, the spirit would be the mind and the breath is part of the soul,

145
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,360
which is the metabolism, because it's one way to know if a person has a metabolism is

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,020
that they're breathing.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,560
They check for breathing first, even, you know, in medical community, where they check

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
for breathing and then heart rate, right?

149
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,900
If there's no breathing and there's no heart rate or heart beat, that means the metabolism

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,200
is gone, but it's not too far gone.

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,480
We try to revive the heartbeat and the breath.

152
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,960
Now, you can have no breath and no heartbeat.

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,100
Like someone, you hear about people with the NDEs that fall in Frozen Lake and they

154
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
pull them out a half hour later.

155
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,000
They're not breathing.

156
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,680
There's no heartbeat.

157
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,760
But they're resuscitated.

158
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,280
Right.

159
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,800
OK, so the metabolism was able to be brought back.

160
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:53,680
Right.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,800
So that's and that's the soul is part of that.

162
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:56,980
Right.

163
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,760
You need the breathing.

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,360
OK, so there's like a car.

165
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
If you put your hand over the carburetor or put a potato in the muffler, it doesn't work.

166
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Right.

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,800
But it doesn't mean the car is wasted.

168
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,700
But if you are breathing is prevented, the car is wasted, right?

169
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,540
The body is wasted.

170
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,500
You run out of gas.

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,680
Everything stops running.

172
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,040
But you could pour some more gas to breathe.

173
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,160
Well, see, a car also has breathing.

174
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,040
It has to be there.

175
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,920
But it needs fuel.

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,460
Right.

177
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,320
So the body, when the body dies and there's no metabolism to keep these processes going

178
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,500
and exchanging elimination and nutritive functions, it goes into chemical decay, strictly

179
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,200
chemical decay, because all the ethereal energetic part is gone.

180
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,380
Now, the spirit is just the mind.

181
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,380
So the process is not there, which always kind of made me feel uneasy about the document.

182
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,300
Not getting into that because it's a major personal eschatology, you know, the end of

183
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,800
all things.

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,220
But for each person, all the scripture, the Bible ever gets into is that death equals

185
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,780
sleep.

186
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:01,980
Right.

187
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
There's no consciousness.

188
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:03,740
Right.

189
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,300
Right.

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,200
And then, of course, there's the decay and all that physical decay.

191
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,500
That's all there is.

192
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,340
And there is no consciousness at all.

193
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,720
So these NDEs where people see things, you know, whatever, take your pick and they come

194
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,980
back.

195
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,960
They didn't really die.

196
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,920
How do I know they didn't die?

197
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,360
Because they came back to tell the story.

198
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,040
So the scripture is very, the Bible is very strict about that, that when you're dead,

199
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,620
you're dead.

200
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,040
Right.

201
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,700
And then you have to wait for something called the resurrection in most aspects.

202
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,720
So so there's not much.

203
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,220
Now, if you look at, for example, other cultures where the Bardo, let's say, in the Tibetan

204
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,820
culture, it was before Buddhism, it was called Bo, I think.

205
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,920
What they do is they they sit around.

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,980
Well, they have several processes and they have someone, if you can afford it, speak

207
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,840
to the body for quite a few days to make sure that the person continues on their path once

208
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,340
they left.

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,580
Right.

210
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,220
OK.

211
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,260
Because it seems they talk about that even though you've left your body, you still can

212
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
see everything that's going on.

213
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,660
And you're wondering why you're, you know, you know, ceiling height or bird's eye view

214
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,140
of yourself and other people.

215
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,420
And you'll have someone there in the room, let's say a monk reading the Bardo or whatever

216
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,900
for days and days to tell you, you know, you're dead now.

217
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,720
So keep going.

218
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:24,980
Right.

219
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,440
Or there's several paths that they discuss and write a more a more modern presentation

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,400
of that is, you know, the people that see themselves laying on the end, you know, whatever

221
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
this goes in line with the modern NDE.

222
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,680
So the Bardo, what is what it's doing is it's pretty much taking into account that it's

223
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,760
possible for the person to, you know, jump back in their body and be revived.

224
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,180
All right.

225
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,020
So what they're doing is like, well, if you left, there's you know, it's like, you know,

226
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,260
it's one strike, you're out if you, you know, so they keep talking your way.

227
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,860
So these people have come back with NDEs, saw myself over the operating table or whatever.

228
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,000
Then I came back and I woke up.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,760
Well, in this case, there'll be someone talking at you that you left to buy and you're dead.

230
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,800
Now, continue on.

231
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,620
Go to this place.

232
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,060
Go to that.

233
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,980
You know what you see, what colors you see, what level of light you see, and it would

234
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,500
be directed away from the body not to come back.

235
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:20,720
Interesting.

236
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,440
So and these things have kind of been.

237
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,460
I don't know if you would call stories of NDE people coming at confirmation because

238
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,620
there's a little bit of a mindfuck going on with those, because if you're a staunch Christian,

239
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,260
you see Jesus, right?

240
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,240
If you're a staunch Muslim, you see Mohammed, right?

241
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,240
Or if you're in from the Hindu culture, you'll see, right, another character.

242
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,780
Well, and a lot of people thought it was like, wait a second, wait a second.

243
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,060
So it's culturally based.

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, something's got something more to this.

245
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,400
Definitely because some people don't describe any other character there.

246
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,640
They talk about, you know, a tunnel and then maybe aliens.

247
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,480
They'll see voices.

248
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,880
They'll see disembodied figures.

249
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,220
Or they think they're ancestors.

250
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,540
The most popular one is they see whatever religious figure is prominent in the culture

251
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,280
that it came from.

252
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,360
So to me, that doesn't seem.

253
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,980
Or they're ancestors, which is another thing, because a lot of cultures teach you that your

254
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,760
ancestors are still watching over you.

255
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,900
Yeah.

256
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,060
It could be anything, actually.

257
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,800
Sometimes it gets quite bizarre.

258
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,100
So there's no uniformity to this.

259
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,180
So the answer to that is no, there is nothing much about that.

260
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Which actually makes, let's just say it this way, what they call, what's called the Bible,

261
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
even Preservation, highly suspect of being the be-all end-all of knowledge, because it

262
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,080
doesn't give anything about death.

263
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,060
It's very self-directed towards this world.

264
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,580
So to me, that's like, I'd want to give some more information on that.

265
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,860
So that's what made, that's one of the things, it's a good question, because it made me very

266
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,840
suspect about the preeminent nature of the Bible.

267
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,640
Because if it was a preeminent text and such, it would include more on that.

268
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,260
So that's actually a good question, because it did, it's like, ah, you know, people ask

269
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,520
me that, it's like, yeah, that's like a weak spot in the Bible, a major weak spot.

270
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,120
You know, when I say a major weak spot, because death is a major issue.

271
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,020
No, it's universal, right?

272
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean, the one thing that we're pretty much guaranteed the moment that we're born onto

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,880
this world, right?

274
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,100
And we become, you know, part of the...

275
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,560
Yeah, at this point, at this point that we, in the cycle that we are, yeah.

276
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,580
I think that at one point, yeah, another point won't be a consideration.

277
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,680
Well, maybe not.

278
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,920
But at this point, you can't really direct me to anybody who has, you know, not succumbed

279
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,960
to death, right?

280
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
At some point or other.

281
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,060
Or will.

282
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,860
Or will, yeah.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,700
Everyone either does or will.

284
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,460
Yeah.

285
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,520
But for me, the big point is that we're not getting information from the Bible, which kinds

286
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,980
of brings it down in priority quite a bit in that subject.

287
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,820
And you know, if you have, there are other things in there as well that make it seem

288
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,800
like, eh, if this is like such a high level, let's say communique or memo, why does it

289
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440
not have this stuff in it that seems to be preemptively important to anyone personally

290
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,420
or socially or whatever?

291
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,660
So yeah, it's a little kink and chink in the armor.

292
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,620
And I've always viewed it as such, but that's okay.

293
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,240
This is where we are.

294
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,780
Like Woody Allen said, if death was so bad, how come no one's come back to complain, right?

295
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,680
So, yeah, so all right, what it was, I looked in the chat, there's some talk, some people

296
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,480
coming back and forth, something recently put up by Archaics about the second seal and

297
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,060
things going on in the US and with the eclipse and all that.

298
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,820
And one of the questions was on one of the Freeman, I think 2020 podcasts I did with

299
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,160
him, I brought up the vaccine is that the vaccine is all based on astrological, they're getting

300
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,000
away from some astrological alignment to put it out, which is pretty much what the

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
Archaics Breshears has been talking about recently.

302
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:06,700
So I think I brought that to light four years ago with Freeman, and there's not much more

303
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,200
I can expand on that, which astronomical alignment or astrological feature they're looking for,

304
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm not so sure, but I'll tell you what.

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,360
Even these elite, let's say you want to call them whatever, Illuminati's, whatever, they're

306
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,120
not that smart.

307
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,800
In other words, if you have heard of them, seen their name or their face or know about

308
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,080
them even historically, they're just a front man.

309
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,760
They're always been the powers and never revealed themselves ever, ever at all.

310
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,220
No one has.

311
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,140
Now, that doesn't mean they're not on the surface.

312
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,960
They work as the janitor, right?

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,920
Like the real, like, okay, give you an example.

314
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,880
The Bilderbergers, right?

315
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,780
They have these meetings and Alex Jones is out there with his megaphone, let's just say,

316
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,620
you know, harking back, you know, a decade or so.

317
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,920
And they get these paparazzi shots of the limos coming in with Rockefeller and the Secretary

318
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,700
of State Kissinger, right?

319
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,600
You see that all the time, right?

320
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,700
There was a who, yeah, you know, well, you know who the real important guys are?

321
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,920
They put on the chauffeur outfit and the hat, they're the limo drivers.

322
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,560
That's how they get it.

323
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,339
Because they don't want to be have their picture taken when they're sitting in the back of

324
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,660
someone prominent being chauffeured.

325
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,319
They actually dress up as the chauffeur.

326
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,780
They actually dress up as the janitor.

327
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,700
Right.

328
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,160
Or the waiting staff, you know, or the waiting staff, you know, yeah, or a prostitute or

329
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,440
whatever, you know, 15, the service industry people, right?

330
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
15 is service industry, by the way.

331
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,480
15 buses wearing the same jacket, nobody's going to pay attention to a single one of

332
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,760
them.

333
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,540
You know what I mean?

334
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,660
Well, it's no, you just dress up like either a homeless person, security guard, service.

335
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,080
Take your pick on service.

336
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,740
It could be food, sex, driving.

337
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,740
It could be all kinds.

338
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,880
So that's how you get in and out of these places and never be focused on.

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,640
Never have your picture ever looked at or examined.

340
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,600
But I'll tell you this, if you took this, what I just said, I assure you, as a let's

341
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,040
just say as a baseline research project, and he started looking at all these places where

342
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,020
these quote unquote elitists go.

343
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,300
And he just focused on who was the security or who was the chauffeur, the driver.

344
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,720
You'll see it's the same driver, different people in the back for different events all

345
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,360
over the world.

346
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,460
You're like, wait a second.

347
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,720
How?

348
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,880
Why is this guy the driver here in Belgium?

349
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,880
He's also the driver in Australia.

350
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,020
He's also the driver in Dubai.

351
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Wait a second.

352
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,440
Who is this guy?

353
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,580
No one's looking at all.

354
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,620
The same DoorDash guy brings pizza to him in Germany and also in Canada.

355
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,980
You know, well, they're going to show up at the event somehow.

356
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,380
Also, they have secret.

357
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,600
A lot of these places I've stayed at the main Bilderberg Hotel here in Washington, D.C.,

358
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,260
in the US.

359
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,560
And you go and they have elevators, like three or four stories.

360
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,600
They have you go in that elevator and you know that's not an elevator for three or four

361
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,300
stories. You look, they have a presidential suite.

362
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:11,620
I went up to the you could see they could tell that elevator goes down and down and

363
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,160
down and down.

364
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,360
Right. It's not.

365
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,460
Yeah. I don't know how to kind of explain it.

366
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,900
There are elevators and then there are elevators, you know, when you go to the basement

367
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,060
floor, you the basement, you put in a code and it opens another control panel and you

368
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,500
can go to another lobby or in the old days you might switch elevators to another

369
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,140
elevator. Right. Yeah. Or you might see, you know, in the old days, you know, OK, it's

370
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,000
five stories. So you see six buttons because one is for the basement and then you see a

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
bunch of key holes, right?

372
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,140
A bunch of places. Well, you hear from I'm very familiar with elevator engineering.

373
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,080
Let me put it this way. And also, I've been in elevators thousands of times because I

374
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,100
was a bicycle messenger in the early 80s in New York City, which means you're going to

375
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,220
be going through at least 20, 30, 50, 40, 100 elevator rides a day.

376
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,900
Right. I noticed elevator construction and the fewer stories, the

377
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,860
less robust the elevator, the more stories, the more robust the elevator was and more

378
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,240
technologically advanced.

379
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,160
So you go into that Marriott in Washington, D.C.

380
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,900
So it's right by the George Bush CIA headquarters, by the way.

381
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,260
It's about three blocks away. Right.

382
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,220
You get in that elevator, it's only four stories to go up the presidential suite and you are in an

383
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,980
elevator, the type of elevator that would be in a 50 story building.

384
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,440
Elevator, elevator cab style.

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,040
You're like, wait a second.

386
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,620
This is like this is this is not an elevator for a three or four story building.

387
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,680
So if you once you get a sense of this engineering involved, you can you can tell.

388
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,000
Right. Some hospitals are like that as well.

389
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,260
We'll go into some small building and you get into an elevator.

390
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,740
That's you know, these you've seen these elevators only in skyscrapers before.

391
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,160
Why would they put this elevator in a three story building?

392
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,980
Well, because it has to go a lot of floors down also.

393
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,020
Very interesting. I always it's always been in the back of my mind.

394
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,960
I don't know how to bring up any real salient points to really show this, but I assure you

395
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,400
that's what's going on in some capacity.

396
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,720
But in terms of we've diverted from the that was a long

397
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,460
tangent from elevators to whatever.

398
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,060
By the way, stay on the elevator thing.

399
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,280
It's I've been listening to stuff in the background here.

400
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,620
Rory Sutherland, he's my age.

401
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,080
Actually, I'm three months older than him.

402
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,540
Big guy at Ogilvy Mather.

403
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,540
If you've anybody's watched Mad Men.

404
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,780
OK, it was an advertising developed.

405
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,620
It was a series AMC developed to the point where it's an advertising agency merged

406
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,360
with in New York with one from England, an old fashioned one from England.

407
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
That's Ogilvy and Mather.

408
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,500
And when I was a bicycle messenger, I did deliver to Ogilvy Mather as well.

409
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,320
I remember those advertising accounts were very kept this very busy.

410
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,220
He wrote a book called Alchemy and there's some it's it's kind of a neat little thing.

411
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't think I'd ever want to read it, though.

412
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,320
But the in marketing, it's not about objectivity.

413
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,580
It's about perception.

414
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,580
So for giving an example with Uber, well, it gives good stick with the elevators.

415
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,200
So there's an apartment, medium sized apartment building in New York City.

416
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,800
And everyone's been complaining on how slow the elevator is, meaning not just to arrive,

417
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,860
but once you're riding the elevator and it was not cost feasible to upgrade the elevator.

418
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,500
So what they did was they installed mirrors floor to ceiling all around the inside of the

419
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,880
elevator cab. And then they did a survey.

420
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,560
Does do you still think, you know, the residents, do you still feel that the elevator is too

421
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,460
slow? And everyone said no.

422
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,680
And the reason being, they didn't explain this.

423
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,980
They suppose the reason being is now because there are full body mirrors in the elevator.

424
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,380
People are actually looking at themselves, their hair, their clothing during the elevator

425
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,340
ride. And they're not so focused on the time anymore.

426
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,460
So nothing objective change, but the perception changed.

427
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,660
That's what made Uber so popular, because when you called a cab.

428
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,840
Whether they said it, they were two minutes away or 40 minutes away, no matter what they

429
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,720
told you, the wait was, you're always wondering, are they going to be late?

430
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Are they going to miss me? Right.

431
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,520
But with Uber, they have an app where they show you where the cab is at all times.

432
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,840
So if you say, well, the cab is supposed to be here at five minutes.

433
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,380
Let's see where he is on the map.

434
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,740
Suppose that you could read a map.

435
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,920
It's amazing how as I'm getting older, I'm realizing how few people can actually read

436
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,900
maps, by the way, which is shameful.

437
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:50,160
But anyway, one of his points that he made was, you know, he said he'd be here in 15

438
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,720
minutes. But look, let's see where he is.

439
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,620
He's obviously stuck in traffic.

440
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,680
Let's go have another beer.

441
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,520
Right. So it's the same.

442
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,380
The waiting time hasn't changed.

443
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,560
Let's say they told you to be there in 15 minutes and they arrive in 15 minutes.

444
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,840
That's 15 minutes. It could be hell on who's waiting.

445
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,040
It's like, what if, what if, what if?

446
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,120
But if you know where they are at all times, you can manage your time better.

447
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,060
So objectively, the waiting time hasn't changed at all.

448
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,940
But your perception of it has.

449
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,020
Right. So this goes back to who's driving the elites.

450
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:28,260
Right. The perception that the that the elites are the ones sitting in the limousine, not

451
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,780
the driver being the one that you know about.

452
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,580
Right. Right. So it goes on and on and on.

453
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,860
So I really like that little bit.

454
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,940
It's been coming up, I play, you know, play stuff in the background while I'm building

455
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,600
things and I'll usually put a YouTube on and a long one.

456
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,020
And it also lets me know how, you know, time goes, you know, for videos, two hours

457
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,640
long and the video is over.

458
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,140
I said, wow, I spent two hours on that.

459
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,100
So I use it as a clock.

460
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,060
But Rory Sutherland has come up lately and he's just make some points that it's are

461
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,100
what were well worth considering.

462
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,580
It's not objective change or objective realities, perceived reality.

463
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,220
And you change the percept things are perceived.

464
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,260
See, another one he gives is like with branding, like you can go anywhere in the world

465
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,900
to a food spot, like let's say a street food vendor in Bangkok, Thailand, or a three

466
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,040
star Michelin restaurant or a five star American restaurant and ask for a Coke.

467
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,520
And if they don't have one, they it's something wrong.

468
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,220
But if you ask for a Dr.

469
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,260
Pepper, something wrong with you.

470
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,380
Right. You see, so it's all about perception and branding.

471
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,900
So what people are used to hearing the Bible is something like that.

472
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,660
All you have to do is tell someone it's from the Bible and they'll agree with it.

473
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,600
You know why? Because they don't know what's in the Bible.

474
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,840
Nobody does because nobody reads it.

475
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,800
Well, it sounds kind of right.

476
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,520
In other words, as long as it sounds like it would be in there.

477
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,400
Right. And the perception, the perception, which, again, like you said, the waiting

478
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,580
time didn't change, just like in the old days when they used to promise you, you know,

479
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,860
your pizza in 30 minutes, which, by the way, they do that with food now, too.

480
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,180
You can watch where your pizza is.

481
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,580
Right. Well, yeah, it's it's yeah, it's not the actual.

482
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,560
Yeah, it's not the object of waiting time.

483
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,360
It's how you perceive the waiting time.

484
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,300
Right. Right.

485
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,860
So if you know where the if they told you they're 30 minutes away and it looks like

486
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,480
they just left, you're not going to be so upset.

487
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,200
You might less upset when they show up in 50 minutes because you know where they are

488
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
the whole time. Yeah. You know, the guy's still over at the whatever pizza joint.

489
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,260
And it's like, OK, I know that that's 15 minutes away.

490
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,960
So I know that he's at least 15 minutes away.

491
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,560
He hasn't left there yet. So they didn't prepare the food for him yet.

492
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,600
He's waiting. Yeah. So he's going to be in other words, they're not going to arrive at

493
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,000
the time that they told me to expect.

494
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,860
They will. But I'm less upset now.

495
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,300
And the person doesn't think because I know what's going on, what's going on.

496
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,960
Right. OK. Right. So this is the perceived aspect.

497
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,060
And this is what's being used against people.

498
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,960
Look what the VAX thing recently, because that also came up with the archaics video.

499
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,380
I haven't gone after you did a part two today.

500
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,300
I have to go back and look at both of them before I can comment.

501
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,940
Right. Wouldn't be sure to comment on it without listening to them.

502
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,740
With the VAX thing, it was all about trust the science is to show me the science that

503
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,380
what's wrong with you. Right.

504
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,280
So you see, they don't have to.

505
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,600
They just tell you to trust the science, even though there is no science behind it at

506
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,300
all, ever.

507
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,900
But because they use the word science and they state that it is scientifically

508
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,620
back, then people will just.

509
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,360
Well, because it's venerated and science is more venerated than religion.

510
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,240
That's why it's at the level of a religion.

511
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,560
Well, and it's more venerated than your best guess.

512
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,880
And it's more venerated than.

513
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,560
So that's the thing, though.

514
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,320
No, this is scientifically proven.

515
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,600
And if you don't if you don't go for just the comment means you're a Luddite or

516
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,280
something, you know, you're a cave or, you know, you're a caveman.

517
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,740
Or a troglodyte like you're a caveman or you're not worth talking to you anyway.

518
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,860
Well, I've got exactly that problem.

519
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,780
Literally, I lost the whole thing.

520
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,700
I was supposed to get some funding and stuff for radio and all this.

521
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,740
And literally it stumbled over.

522
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,880
Wait a minute. You don't do vaccinations.

523
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,300
I'm like, no, I don't. This is before the big vacs, you know, the most recent big

524
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,280
vacs. And I said, no, I actually don't.

525
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,700
You know, this is one of those things.

526
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,780
And this is a person who's about freedom, supposedly, who's about all these things.

527
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,240
And well, they were using these phrases even before it became popularized.

528
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,000
Don't let me give you this point.

529
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,340
This is where this is where it works.

530
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,060
They have been convinced of a science and be the vaccine.

531
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,460
Anything that disturbs that A and B position is disturbing.

532
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,620
Right. Right. So instead of just disagreeing, this is what you do in honor,

533
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,100
honorable trials and things like that.

534
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,460
You don't disagree directly.

535
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,080
You just conditionally accept that with these conditions being met.

536
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,940
So when people I've seen this where I think I've gone over the story several times,

537
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,340
I wouldn't say I'm anti-vaccine, but I would say if they're considering my body

538
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,980
weight, gender and blood type, I'll consider the vaccine.

539
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,320
And then that opens up a whole thing.

540
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,100
Now, it's not yes or no or you versus pro versus con.

541
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,060
Now it's like, oh, wait a second, because when you bring up blood type, body weight

542
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,220
and gender, that sounds something

543
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,300
that could be part of a scientific study and experiment.

544
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,680
That's those are things that are considered, especially in the medical field.

545
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,380
Right. Especially blood type.

546
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,860
Right. You've watched enough mash.

547
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,880
Yeah. Like we can't give him a trick.

548
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,880
We can't. He might die because why?

549
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,880
We don't have his what blood type. Right.

550
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,660
Oh, wow. People have seen that on TV even.

551
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,240
So now when they instead of saying, no, I'm not anti that I'm not.

552
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,840
I'm anti-vax or no, I'm not.

553
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,560
You know, Novak's say, well, are they considering your body weight?

554
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
Blood type and gender.

555
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,120
Wait a second.

556
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,340
What you're saying is too reasonable to just say you're a nut job now.

557
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, and body weight is a reasonable assumption

558
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,240
because any kind of medication of any sort, right?

559
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,440
Anything you have to consider.

560
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,680
But anything injected that has particulars, it's not just saline.

561
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,560
Should have blood type as well.

562
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,020
Well, OK, but because there are blood cells in there are cell.

563
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,040
There is mitochondrial stuff in there.

564
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,620
So they're not mesh. Right.

565
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,280
So but the whole thing is there is the premise of the vaccine.

566
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,240
Any theory that's based on a falsehood, anything that comes from that theory

567
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
must be false. Right.

568
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,200
OK, so the theory that there's an immune system is false.

569
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,380
There is no everything that they describe the immune system is doing is not immune.

570
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,900
It's an eliminative system.

571
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,600
So there's no such thing.

572
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,240
So what's it when they talk about the immune system,

573
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,780
what they're really should be saying is that it's the elimination system.

574
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,920
But they don't because that sounds boring and untechnical and very unscientific.

575
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,000
And if you say immune system, right.

576
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,860
Oh, that's too complicated for a commoner.

577
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,340
Instead, we should do what they say.

578
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,180
Well, elimination.

579
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,360
People generally think of, you know, urination.

580
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,740
And, you know, right. It's too. Yeah, it's too dirty.

581
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,840
In other words, yeah, it's it's kind of like the thing about toilet paper.

582
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
You know, you want toilet paper to be dry.

583
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,400
Not the moist kind.

584
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,040
Why would you want moist toilet paper?

585
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,820
Because you're using toilet paper to anyway.

586
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,020
You see, it's the same.

587
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,300
This is perception again.

588
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,480
It's all perception.

589
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,360
We've seen nurses.

590
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,320
I don't know which shop it was back when the vaccines were being done.

591
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,200
This is before this bout of vaccines.

592
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,660
This is when they were doing them under Obama.

593
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,980
Probably some nurses were lined up.

594
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,660
And someone I was with was saying, no, these vaccines are bad.

595
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,980
And all the nurses and everyone was were laughing at him like,

596
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,000
well, we got a real loose nut here.

597
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,220
And I said, well, are you considering body weight?

598
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,780
But and then they heard that they packed up, they packed up and left.

599
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,380
Well, you're mentioning body weight first.

600
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,600
And that's why I wanted to focus on that, because even, you know, a fool,

601
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,960
you might not necessarily understand blood type or there's an issue with that.

602
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,100
And that's kind of complex.

603
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,120
So what I'm saying is, you don't have to know you do,

604
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,240
but you do understand there is something I do.

605
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,680
I do. But I'm saying if you're having this conversation, it's a little different.

606
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,500
Look, like I said, when it comes to any sort of medication,

607
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,840
somebody would realize that.

608
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,860
Let's just say you wanted to apply an aspirin.

609
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,380
But a vaccine is not medication.

610
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,980
OK, but it is not under the medication category.

611
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,300
OK, then what is it?

612
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,500
It's under inoculation. Inoculation.

613
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,200
OK, but. Yeah, yeah.

614
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,480
It's vaccine actually means VACA, which means it was done for animals and cows,

615
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,040
again, which was a business with people.

616
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,840
Yes, sir. This is it came.

617
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,060
The vaccines came before the Industrial Revolution or at the beginning,

618
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,100
at the at the beginning of it, where the tail end of the agricultural

619
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,860
so they were maximizing, you know, to get after the agriculturists,

620
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,900
you know, the medical. Yeah.

621
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,920
OK, but introducing any chemical into the body in any way whatsoever.

622
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,160
In proportion, in proportion, a weight must be considered.

623
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,400
And that's why, you know, the ones for animals are frauds

624
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,440
because they'll give the same CC or volume vaccine to a grown

625
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,480
Great Dane as they will to a puppy Chihuahua.

626
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,620
Well, but that's the madness of it, right, is that, look, if you're telling me

627
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,940
that a puppy gets the same, you know, the same injection that the that the full

628
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,140
grown, full grown, they do that's what the vets do.

629
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,980
And by the way, if you want to learn about hoaxers,

630
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,460
they're hoaxers to the vets.

631
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,860
But I'm talking from the medical point of view.

632
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,840
What was the last time someone took any animal to the vet

633
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,900
and they checked it for blood pressure, you know, hypertension?

634
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,140
Never. It's something that they only pull out the wool or diabetes.

635
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,860
Now they're doing diabetes for animals, too.

636
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,300
Yes, because that hoax worked.

637
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
It worked really well for there's no such thing.

638
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,180
Anyway, you know, I've been studying the medical stuff,

639
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,160
not from what's on TV or in college, but in their own manuals

640
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,260
that they put out since the 1980s.

641
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,320
And I it's just like the I am so like livid on how little even doctors know.

642
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,380
And they're like, oh, my gosh, you know.

643
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,060
No, the point of the point I was going to try to get to, though,

644
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,180
I thought was relevant because it's it's the easiest, most observable and accessible.

645
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,960
But it's not it's it's not as long as you don't do body.

646
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,719
And but you don't think the perception about body weight is is a very.

647
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,659
No, it's not. No, it has to be.

648
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,120
It has to be that the vaccine is not a medication.

649
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,460
It's an inoculation, which is something completely different.

650
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,580
Just like if you go for a treatment for.

651
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,840
OK, but forget about calling it a medication.

652
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,600
Then what I'm saying is introducing a chemical into the body in any way, shape

653
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,260
or form. No, no.

654
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,500
But you don't want to class about weight because that's too it's too OK.

655
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,940
You want to do a three strikes.

656
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,980
You're out with these people because if you just body weighs

657
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,400
generally, most people have the same weight and they do have a children's dose.

658
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,860
Right. Which they do. But they don't get.

659
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,860
So the thing is to hit them off with enough stuff

660
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,300
that sounds the perception is that, you know, more, you know,

661
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,520
how come that was left out?

662
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,440
Because the three are very important together.

663
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,440
One. Right.

664
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,639
Each one is not important.

665
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,440
Not that it can easily be, but if you hit all three,

666
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,820
it creates the perception that you're looking at a holistic,

667
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,000
the whole well-being of the person, not just one attribute. Right.

668
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,600
I just everyone's been trained to just look at one attribute.

669
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,300
It's a fast car. I got it.

670
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,660
It doesn't have brakes. Right. I just thought it was. I got you.

671
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,000
I just thought it was more accessible if you're looking at body weight,

672
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,040
because like, you know, if I'm sitting here with a guy who's five foot nine

673
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,920
and weighs one hundred and forty pounds. Right.

674
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,080
And I'm you know, I'm six foot and I weigh two hundred and thirty pounds.

675
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,060
You know what? Him and I have a shot of whiskey apiece.

676
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,980
He's got that more than me. You know what I mean?

677
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,420
That's different. I think I've gone over the anesthesia.

678
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,220
If if a 300 pound black man and a 90 pound white woman with red hair

679
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,140
and freckles go, both go for the same appendicitis.

680
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,160
Yeah, the white women out of anesthesia that the little 90 pound white girl

681
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,340
is required to take to put out would kill the 300 pound black man.

682
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,340
So the weight doesn't add up there.

683
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,360
But you have to consider race, gender.

684
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,380
And I didn't get into the race part, but it's race, gender, body weight

685
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,380
and blood type. You didn't mention race. No, you didn't.

686
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,700
But once you hit them with because race is too hard of an issue.

687
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,800
Remember, this is all perception.

688
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,020
If you hit them with those three things and say, wait a second,

689
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,440
how did you come up with these three things? That makes too much sense.

690
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,560
I know those things are important. Wait a second.

691
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,900
As this has nothing to do with discussing the efficacy of vaccines

692
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,480
because the whole premise is false.

693
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,000
No, absolutely. All right.

694
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,940
Yeah. I see Tuesday. Yep. There we are. Ciao. Ciao.
