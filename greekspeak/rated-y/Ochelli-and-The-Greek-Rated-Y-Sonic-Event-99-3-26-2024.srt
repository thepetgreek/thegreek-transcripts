1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,700
Rated Y Sonic event 99 here and here we are what's a few days away from 99

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,800
Sonic's on the wall 99 Sonic's on the wall yep and what are we a week and

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,040
geez I don't know a week in five days or a week in four days depending on how

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,460
you're counting it an eclipse coming up yeah but also it's the first I think

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,320
rating it as the first month is good too I think everything was squared away the

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,940
other day was first day of the first month and the number of the year doesn't

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,700
change until the at the year is over it's kind of different so I think

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,780
there's a bunch of people in the chat we're looking at it we've been under

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,500
solid cloud cover big storms here so you didn't see the you didn't see the

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,480
fullness of the moon about three four days ago okay no not at all not at all

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,319
even coming to it it's just been very very stormy here I did some weather

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,560
stuff about three months ago very low and slow let's say and it's yielded a

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,700
day of rain a full day of nice slow penetrating rain every week for the past

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,620
three months the place is blooming so very unusual very much against the

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,720
forecasts but they do show it because it's unmistakable so yeah redeeming the

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,000
desert is is totally doable one day someone asked me by the way but speaking

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,260
more in Trevor James Constable we'll do that and we'll talk about the pitfalls

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,380
and benefits of weather work in the future but yeah the eclipse yeah let's

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,390
just tie that into some questions in the chat regarding the Archaic's videos I'll

20
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:53,610
bring up the videos let's see let's see get the laptop going here once again I

21
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,550
mean you you appreciate the chronology not necessarily signed on yeah well it's

22
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,790
Texas country meets the internet he's pretty rough around the edges but I'm

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,570
very grateful for the information is put out look if we're here about learning

24
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,230
you know look if you're here doing okay you do sonic events or podcasts or

25
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,110
whatever for performance you're doing it for performance entertainment but if

26
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,170
you're doing it to share what can be learned you notice how I that's beyond

27
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,530
third party right what can be learned then you have to stick to it right so

28
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,350
that's what I'm about that's what I've been doing and because the major major

29
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,730
thing that I've noticed about surface-dwelling earth inhabitants it

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,690
tense other than their apathy is they don't learn they just don't learn and

31
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,110
it's very easy to do almost like a fait accompli you're always gonna have

32
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,290
history repeat itself I mean I try and combine it does the cycles of

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,930
catastrophism do I once while back with the Archon I was saying you know the

34
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,890
earth could have been completely destroyed or you know up until the year

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,630
800 and I kind of gave loose interpretation of what I found in

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,550
history but when you look at the archaic stuff he nails it down to the

37
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,290
years okay the the it's our kicks it's the first one he did on this subject

38
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:15,990
matter signs of the artificer archaic's interpretation of 2024 eclipse the other

39
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,410
one what would be harbinger of the second seal for a sorry more 820 24 yeah

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,370
what would be an artificer there's a word I don't recognize immediately

41
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:34,610
what's an artifies there's an artist oh okay all right let's look it up let's

42
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:42,450
look it up okay yeah it's that's art you know that yeah well you know

43
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,630
artifies or could be artifact you know I mean I don't know one who makes art of

44
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:55,030
skill or or one who makes by art or skill agent of an artifice inventor of

45
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,450
devious artifies is military sense a soldier mechanic so it tends to be more

46
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,170
on the malevolent side okay my craft or skill but artifies artifies or yeah it

47
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,470
would be something like someone who makes let's say the tools of the trade

48
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,910
for magicians press the digitation ledger domain would be an artificer

49
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,329
right you know I have a niece she goes by Wendy blades she's like one of the

50
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,450
top five sword swallowers in the world and she said for a while she worked with

51
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,030
magicians and I said oh cut lady in half and she goes oh yeah I said were you in

52
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,530
the box or out of the box I was in the box and she was so surprised that you

53
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:42,570
know I was able to talk about them the artifices of the magic trade because it's

54
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,170
about perception right okay without going too much of a tangent so by the

55
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,310
way I think I've gone over this you know when a woman's cut in half on stage and

56
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,570
put back together the box is always big enough to have another woman who's very

57
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,870
let's just say we someone's very flexible what do they call them people

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,030
that say what I call it contortionist what are they contortionist that's right

59
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,150
so you have a contortionist on the lower half of the box and as the woman is

60
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,810
stepping as she's placing her body in the box the person the woman inside the

61
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,050
box has to carefully time it to stick her legs out and she's all right and now

62
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,930
you know it's completely separate the whole time it runs the saw two separate

63
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,490
legs I put it in that right and when the woman's getting out of the box the one

64
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,450
that's contorted on the bottom half of the box has to pull her legs in and very

65
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,950
good time it's all about timing yeah so that's how that trick is done but you

66
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,590
see the magicians lies everyone if you don't know the trick you swear that you

67
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,110
just saw a woman being cut in half and put back together so that's what this

68
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,330
reality is going and has been going for it it shows lies and people swear to it

69
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,690
so I lie and you swear to it how's that for a deal hmm that's what attorneys are

70
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,150
doing that's what doctors are doing magically using a saw on somebody should

71
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,610
result in some blood being spattered but you know forget about that that doesn't

72
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,310
happen so well there's other things that go on I mean that do result in that with

73
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,410
the animals yeah so true yeah animals are flattened out right birds

74
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,850
especially when they're put put away you know when they're pulled out and

75
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,550
then put away and disappear they're actually flattened out so okay so the

76
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,890
you got the two videos first one was signs of the artifice or a second was

77
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,250
harbinger of the second seal I read them the back I listened to both of them I

78
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,810
didn't sit and watch if you put up anything he had some charts very

79
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,610
plausible very rational but we live in a world that's more plausible than

80
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,470
rational I like it I like it very much what I do like more than the information

81
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,350
that he gave out is by the end of the very convincing quote-unquote as the

82
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,550
academics say argument he said this doesn't mean that any of this is set in

83
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,030
stone so what he's doing is laying out what he would breadcrumbs he found right

84
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,370
yeah so you know I I like it I like it I would agree with everything that he put

85
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:14,470
up is pretty fundamental so yeah I give it a thumbs up yep on that so that

86
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,950
would be my review on it without getting into specifics because the specifics are

87
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,290
laid out in those two videos I don't think do I need to give the dates let's

88
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,050
just click on one here what the date on the first one which is sign of the

89
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:36,090
artificer would have been on March 20th 2024 and the other one was following

90
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,010
that you'll see it's part two okay so that's my comment on that but we don't

91
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,550
live in a rational world see the rationalists I've been in really really

92
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:53,930
enjoying an audiobook by Rory Sutherland it's called alchemy and why rational

93
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,690
ideas don't always make sense and sometimes the opposite of a good idea is

94
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:05,150
another good idea right so he it's very interesting this psychology I've always

95
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,690
been inclined to that but I always speak on being logic and rational because we

96
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,750
don't have enough of that without it being a specialty right you have

97
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,790
statisticians economists mathematicians and that's a specialty and their whole

98
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,430
job is about being logical and rational but the entire population is not so when

99
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,710
you're doing marketing you're just unless you're marketing to economics even

100
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,210
to them they would be fault economists mathematicians scientists or whatever

101
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,289
who tend to be rational you're marketing to the masses who are not and I really

102
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,490
enjoyed I'm still listening to the audio book in the back room basically where I

103
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,750
live and work I have speakers indoors and outdoors in a control center I could

104
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,270
put on a video or an audio or music and anywhere I go it's playing I could turn

105
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:01,450
some areas of the downer so it's high fidelity very high fidelity stuff it

106
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,670
sounds like you know someone's here you know so when I'm listening to the

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,370
audio book it actually sounds like someone's in the room speaking it

108
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,890
doesn't sound you know so I get I get them I get the full effect of it really

109
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:21,250
enjoying it if you he's done with quite a few YouTube videos Rory Sutherland he's

110
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,570
advice this is senior vice president of Ogilvy and Mather I think I did mention

111
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,750
if you ever watched the AMC series Mad Men it's modeled around the story of

112
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,110
ogle of Mather and Ogilvy Ogilvy is the British side matters in New York side

113
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,050
okay so the rationality of what he put out going back to archaics is pretty

114
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,110
good again it has a feathered touch to it because you know what you're doing is

115
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,790
taking information from here and seeing how applies through coincidence and

116
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,610
rationale right and it's very good very good by the way you see that boat hit

117
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,410
the bridge it's a ship hit the bridge yeah yeah that was that was really cool

118
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,210
because what's cool about it well first of all it's a shit bridge the towers

119
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,290
were made of the same expanded or you know channeled steel you shouldn't do

120
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,770
that by the way the tower should be very robust right but the second thing it's

121
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,190
the deliberate crash I mean it's a deliberate ramming right until you know

122
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,410
it looked like something that the Assyrians would have done 700 BC

123
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,930
breaching the walls of Damascus right with siege works you know they have this

124
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,510
ram right he's got hundred people on each side and the rams like this tree

125
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,310
you know it's two foot in diameter right with a bronze plating on the front and

126
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,450
they ram the wall right yeah sometimes I refer to that stuff as siege machines

127
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,590
and things like siege works yeah they sometimes fashion them as large penises

128
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,050
yeah that's what they did with this thing and what they did was you know the

129
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,170
commentary if you know anything about mechanics you could see the black smoke

130
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,930
billowing out and gray smoke that means something blue in the motor or the

131
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,310
boiler actually that was probably a diesel direct they were flooding with

132
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,950
fuel I don't know if that was just a signal a ship was in trouble but there

133
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,370
are redundants redundant safety controls on these ships by the way and they

134
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,330
they could be you know how you have the self-driving cars yeah it's an unwritten

135
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,850
rule but all ships of any measure are self piloting now by satellite in other

136
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,010
words pick up a line like mask right a big crew of shipping line all of their

137
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,890
ships are tagged and seen by satellite all of the instrumentation the status

138
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,790
engineering is uploaded to satellite back to the home office wherever the

139
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,150
home office is anywhere in the world and the ship can be piloted automatically

140
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,890
anywhere in the world so does that make any sense yeah it does because there's

141
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,250
tremendous backup systems for a tanker fuel tankers have this in it where every

142
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,970
single fuel tanker on the planet has a tracking device in it they know exactly

143
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,370
that's why it's always BS when they just track you the image show whatever the

144
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,210
plane that disappeared yeah the engines you know the plane that disappeared those

145
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,750
engines have 24-hour seven-day-a-week tracking from the it has to be done

146
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,890
from an engineering perspective Rolls-Royce and GE who make most of the

147
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,390
engines yeah but I was they have yeah I was gonna explain that look I don't

148
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,270
necessarily know about airplanes but I do know about the fuel ships because I

149
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,190
work for Exxon and the thing is that they had tracking stuff in there that

150
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,030
also allows them to be able to send other signals in order to take control

151
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,410
in case there's any sorts of that's right it's it's not I'm not talking about

152
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,530
tracking I'm talking about piloting yeah but which is the actual driving of

153
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,930
the ship yeah but I'm saying that all of those systems in a tanker including the

154
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,510
the the cargo ship yeah well but but I'm just saying about Exxon's tankers I know

155
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,110
this specifically that they have a cargo ship yeah and they are very different by

156
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,290
the way tankers and cargo ships oh I know very very different yeah you can't

157
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,610
yeah so I'm just backing you up I know but I'm just backing you up that there

158
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,690
are systems like this where they can absolutely track and exert influence

159
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,030
from a satellite on ships that are constantly running this is not some you

160
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,850
know rarefied thing that maybe wasn't there but it's interesting how it's

161
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,530
Francis Scott Key Bridge you know which is a patriotic name yeah the guy in

162
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,950
history yeah the guy wrote the yeah so it's like let's hit the one leg of the

163
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,670
bridge what does a bridge do right it connects so connectivity you know how

164
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,310
you had all this stuff talking about the connectivity was going to be taken down

165
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,010
what am I talking about how do you get connectivity connectivity connectivity

166
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,870
through the internet right right it didn't happen right so they unmanifested

167
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,410
it this way but yeah anyway I think you're on top of these current events

168
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,730
you saw that thing going in there I mean there that was a trajectory I mean yes

169
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,650
they're they don't they take they're very cumbersome but before you even got

170
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,270
into those I would call them narrows mm-hmm right the the water body you

171
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,990
would have set the ship in the center they deliberately in those kinds of water

172
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,110
ways they do dredging in the center for large ships to come through and he was

173
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,170
there off to the side and that didn't seem kosher to me at all see again with

174
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,190
these large things on water here's the thing you have to be very intentional you

175
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,470
can't you know the old expression you can't turn on a dime so clearly long

176
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,590
ahead of any turn you'd have to make or any obstacle you make sure to line oh

177
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,570
no you're you're not fighting where you're going to be an hour from now and

178
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,390
you're setting it up now right that's what I was yeah that's what I mean yeah

179
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,050
just just like yeah just like anything big like that which is the very fact

180
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,690
that it was lined up with the tower away from the deepest part of the narrows

181
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,710
well the only counter to that okay the only counter to that and it's a

182
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,830
question I have for you is that you know of course they in the news stories

183
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,190
immediately and I do mean universally they were stating that there was a

184
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,610
power failure just before and of course this happened that you know in one

185
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,390
o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning at 130 a power failure on

186
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,230
the ship you mean or a power failure on land they were saying that there was a

187
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,490
power failure on the ship and by the way according to the last thing I saw

188
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,450
there's six people that were working on the bridge at the time and of course

189
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,870
that's always interesting to you ever notice how there's always workers on

190
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,850
whatever's your yeah but the numbers it's like in Russia the initial numbers

191
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:40,210
it was 11 terrorists and 133 right 11 and 33 make 44 144 you know yeah these

192
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,010
these are all this is what I call signaling this is six workers missing so

193
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,370
that's what I was gonna ask you about yeah six it's sick cuz six is a number

194
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,750
of men they're signaling stuff here and there and what's funny is the okay the

195
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,770
signal is what you know they ran a cargo ship rammed into a bridge which

196
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,890
doesn't happen even even sailboats are better than that so so what they're

197
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,110
signaling is what you saw objectively a ship a large ship rams into the Francis

198
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,510
Scott Key patriotic bridge right bridges bring people together right where they

199
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,810
normally couldn't come together easily and without getting wet right so you

200
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,930
have dry crossing you know represents all these things but I don't like to go

201
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,870
down that path but it's interesting and the people that they hire to explain it

202
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,090
away are really really dumb and the excuses are really really dumb why

203
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,310
because if they were intelligent no one would believe them but if you make them

204
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,510
really dumb and farcical everyone believes them same stuff going on do I

205
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,630
really care I think that bridge should have never been built the way it was you

206
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,810
know so maybe they'll build something better I doubt it I doubt it but you

207
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,550
know you can build something like that very fast now but those towers were out

208
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,730
inadequate right hmm so but that's okay I just think it's funny as hell I mean

209
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,109
yeah people lose their lives but you listen if we if anyone ever hears us

210
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,609
making fun of people getting killed in these events I want you to remember this

211
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm not making fun of it I'm just making light of it that more people are killed

212
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,530
by your medical doctors than any other reason you core an incident ever every

213
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,730
day so you're gonna have to have an incident where you get more than 3,000

214
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,750
people to 5,000 people a day for them to top what the medical doctors are doing

215
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,330
of course you know one weird thing I wanted to ask you about actually is the

216
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,750
fact that they claim that this this vessel is precisely the same vessel that

217
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,930
was involved in a collision when leaving the port of Antwerp in Belgium in 2016

218
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,470
fine which is fine interesting so the vessel is a bully

219
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,410
apparently it's a you know it's other collisions as history of bullying and at

220
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,570
the schoolyard yeah I guess of course lost to the bridge you know yeah that's

221
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:06,050
often that's to soften the surprise so this is what literally literally some

222
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,910
people say what you just said about happening in Antwerp they'll say oh that

223
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,790
makes more sense makes more sense because oh that but it does it that boat

224
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,470
had trouble so yeah but all they're doing is oversimplifying and saying yeah

225
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,290
you know oh that thing had trouble before so trouble again you know so yeah

226
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,530
just to me and it's all bullshit 100% right yeah I love it because you know what

227
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,030
I say I love it I'm not that I like bullshit but just another day and still

228
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,910
running the same program so that's what that's what rated Y is about just we

229
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:41,070
just talk about this let's see the program it's very simple and another

230
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,530
day stupid stupid games you went through stupid prizes fair enough and

231
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,670
you know and look the one thing you're guaranteed is is a fair amount of

232
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,770
consistency you know much like we said earlier you know does history repeat

233
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,490
itself of course it does but it's again it's it's consistency really more than

234
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,990
rhyming or you know but what I do like what the archaic stuff again is the

235
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,250
cycle and I've gotten into that sort of I was never again my stuff was just let's

236
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,490
look at what we have what's being put out like archaics did brochures but he

237
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,990
did it in a very very narrow and deep way and there's other people that

238
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,130
probably know this but he's the only one speaking out on these matters what I

239
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,070
always said is let's just go look at things that are significant in our lives

240
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,710
and what's written about them or memorialized or shown about them and

241
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,310
just use that as our baseline and no one's doing that well not no one but you

242
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,350
know very few and let's just talk about them because it's very surprising when

243
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,970
you find out that the truth of the matter which by the way is not a fact you know

244
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,130
facts and truths are two different things in many times especially legally

245
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,030
so I guess people have surmised that if you're if you've been listening to Greek

246
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,390
speak for a while well they might have surmised it but I mean I wouldn't mind if

247
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,510
you elaborated about that it's maybe we should do do one on that oh it's a

248
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,150
subjective truth is not but it's very again we live in a reality that likes to

249
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,390
impress us with perception so give an example it's a fact that if I wear a

250
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,690
pink baseball cap on what they call Monday keeps the elephants out of Tucson

251
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,250
that's a fact because there's no elephants how is it a fact because

252
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,150
there's no elephants in Tucson that's where you win that means that that is a

253
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,090
fact it's what I just said is a fact it's a fact there are no elephants in

254
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,390
Tucson because I wear a pink hat every Monday right that's the state well it's

255
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,370
can we prove that yeah well not the part that the hat is keeping them away but the

256
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,650
whole statement that there are no elephants in Tucson right well on the

257
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,750
whole but you did that there's therefore no elephants in Tucson I mean I could

258
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,430
tell you I ate a cheese sandwich and you slept four hours you know and two things

259
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,010
they could both be true but it's not because causality is not attached you

260
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,930
know yeah that's why this is tied back to if you ever been set in federal cases

261
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,890
you bring up any law the judge gets very upset so you can't bring law into

262
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,310
this courtroom but when they have the media and the press they say well the law

263
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,770
says this look so you live in a very distorted devious situation so that's

264
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,130
why when you're dealing with anyone or anything you hold them accountable to not

265
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,070
what's what the situation is the subject matter but are they doing what they're

266
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,910
supposed to be doing right you know just like with anything if someone go if

267
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,870
the medical parts kind of difficult well the police and the police have kept

268
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,710
you alive for 50 years Greg you've been alive for 50 years and there have been

269
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,630
it's because there you go yeah the banker they're basically clerks for the

270
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,270
central banks well they're the police what they are I think we've gotten to

271
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,630
this police are when when the central bank the private bank takes over your

272
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:58,890
town they protect their they own the property on paper so they need to create

273
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,110
policing to protect their property so every police force that you see whether

274
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,390
it's Interpol or local or city or whatever is there to protect the

275
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,290
interests of the bankers period that's the history go look at it well and

276
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,030
that's why this small towns don't happily they have sheriff's which put

277
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:21,210
which sheriff is the interest of the king again so yeah yeah it's pretty it's

278
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:27,350
pretty yeah I mean but you know it's better no I got you again it's it's just

279
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,170
two facts put together don't necessarily make a truth again I mean you could say

280
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,530
look there's 15 prostitutes in my town therefore I get good vegetables it

281
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,830
they're not connected but you know I say they're connected and both things hey

282
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:48,170
look there are this many prostitutes you do the JFK thing so you see what it's

283
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,730
kind of ludicrous but again based on the stuff that I just enjoyed listening to

284
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,890
Rory Sutherland on his alchemy audiobook that it's all percent look

285
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,670
most of the stuff that works well with people in general isn't doesn't make any

286
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,230
sense at all and you know you tie that in with what I've been saying that if

287
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,950
you you know like if you had a real education system that was viable no one

288
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,570
would understand anything they they wouldn't understand it so you have to

289
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,750
have right because they've been indoctrinated and almost bred it's a

290
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,850
grooming is you have breeding and grooming breeding is when you put the

291
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,290
male-female pair together based on certain criteria to procreate and then

292
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:41,350
grooming is when they procreate from a young age you guide that offspring into

293
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,290
living a certain way so what people don't realize even with all the

294
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,170
subjectivity that they have in their lives is that they've been part of a

295
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:54,110
breeding and grooming program that's been going on very strictly since the

296
00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:00,650
early 1700s right so that's that's that also has to be taken consideration and

297
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,410
that's where the psychology is the psychology is very simple when you

298
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,730
understand the breeding and grooming programs that have been put in place and

299
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,050
they drop it in front of you in a very oversimplified manner like grooming at

300
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:18,170
this point the common vernacular is to use it for preparing a child to be

301
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,630
exploited yet no no to be exploited as sexually is generally what grooming is

302
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,090
about at this all that as well yeah it's all set well it has to be it has to

303
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,650
be because the sexual aspect of it has to be always in the mix because that

304
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,430
leads eventually back to the breeding right the cycle it's part of the

305
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,230
parameters that need to be set by the culture anyway I mean in yeah that's why

306
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,150
there's Huxley where the test everyone's is grown in a test tube right and the

307
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,350
sexual part is completely separated you know right and people and then they

308
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,890
become more pneumatic inside jokes anyone read this stuff you know a comment

309
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,590
was if you enjoyed sex with someone you said oh they were very pneumatic anyway

310
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,110
it's an inside kind of if you haven't read the Brave New World stuff like if

311
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,370
someone as well how how was that date oh she was very pneumatic you know

312
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,170
anyway yeah you have to you have to read it by the way the BBC BBC does a three

313
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,970
hour I think it's on YouTube still free I got to get a film I got the CDs also

314
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,430
I got the CDs yeah there you go it's a word it's worth a watch it's it's if

315
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,870
you're fond of the rated Y stuff you'll really dig it yeah do you like do you

316
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,870
like the black-and-white the old one or do you like the newer one the newer

317
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,250
BBC one the one done in the 80s because there was one I should say that without

318
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,070
criticizing with not much of a criticism because I'm not familiar with the black

319
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,650
and white one yeah there's a very old black and white one that I think was made

320
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,910
like at the end of the 50s I want to say maybe I should Wow I think then I would

321
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,070
go with the one made in the 80s of which might have been a little more risque

322
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,110
yeah definitely definitely but I mean they definitely had a different view of

323
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:10,250
the like I think it's a view screens oh no maybe it's not the view screens it's

324
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,630
yeah but either way check it out to be yeah it's probably still on YouTube okay

325
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,610
I'd say watch them all really
