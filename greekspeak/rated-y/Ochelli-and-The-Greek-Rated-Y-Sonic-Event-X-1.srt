1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,040
Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, and here we are again.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,680
How are you doing?

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,200
Oh, what do you think?

4
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:16,340
What do you think how I'm doing?

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,480
What do you mean how I'm doing?

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,120
You're still on this planet, right?

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,260
You're still on this planet, so how could you be doing?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, right.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,480
That's right.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,960
I use that a lot, by the way.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,320
You know, people give me a little bit of a confounded look or they're wondering about

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,320
something that's brought up in conversation, not necessarily by me.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,320
I look at those.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,000
Hold on a second.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,780
Have you been on this planet for more than an hour?

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,880
And that really, you know, they're never going to hear it, right?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,500
No one.

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,500
No one talks like that.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,200
So what it does, it's a pattern breaker, right?

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,820
It gets snaps.

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,020
Because people run on autopilot, right?

22
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,700
You know, I think about, you know, well, look, yeah, I'll just keep it at that.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,080
I don't have to explain that.

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,540
You know what autopilot is, right?

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,000
To a degree.

26
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,200
Almost anybody who has been on this earth a while, right?

27
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,640
If you've been through your adolescence, your childhood time, and you're into adulthood

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,340
at some point, you've run on autopilot.

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:06,600
Yeah.

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,500
Yeah.

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,920
So when I come around, it's like, all right, turn the autopilot off.

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,540
You need manual controls now, right?

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,720
And they're not used to it.

34
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,040
And it's like, yeah, you're flying and you think the autopilot's going to do everything.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,980
That's why you get that strange look when you actually provoke them to think about something

36
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,520
for a moment.

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,420
Like there's this weird twist in the face because it's uncomfortable for a moment, right?

38
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,820
You know, because they're not used to it.

39
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,940
Well, let's talk about the autopilot.

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,560
How does it work?

41
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,620
It's a whole bunch of sensors that give back feedback to an algorithm.

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah.

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,580
And that's how we work.

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,540
We have a whole bunch of sensors, you know, and most of the time, a perfect example, if

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,260
you ride a bicycle or drive with a car or a truck or whatever, you could be doing other

46
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,840
things, you know, once you're an experienced, quote, unquote, operator, right?

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,600
And you know, you could be, I shouldn't say this on the phone, eating a breakfast or whatever

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,320
while you're driving.

49
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,740
And at the same time, you know, you don't miss a beat.

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,280
You hit, you know, you slow down, speed up, make a turn, stop, you know, obey the traffic

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,800
signals.

52
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,340
No problem.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,580
And if you're really not conscious of it, you know, if I'm sitting next to you, I say,

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,080
how many, how long were you at the traffic light and was it a stop sign or traffic light?

55
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,960
How many pedestrians were crossing in front of you when you whizzed by?

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,560
They don't know.

57
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,400
It's like you don't know.

58
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,760
So, so it can be, autopilot could be very critical, but again, it works on sensors and

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,300
algorithms.

60
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,780
Right.

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,160
So how many lefts did you take?

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
How many rights did you take?

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
You'd actually have to recreate.

64
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:31,800
I don't know.

65
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,060
Yeah.

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,740
No, they don't know.

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,540
That's good.

68
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,140
But they're doing it well while they're doing it and they're not on autopilot, but they

69
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,700
are.

70
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,080
And I mean, in other words, what they're operating, the machine, the device is, has not offered

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,120
autopilot feature.

72
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,800
They go into autopilot on their own.

73
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,680
Their mind seems to go somewhere else.

74
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
People say, right.

75
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,420
And your mind is not necessarily on this.

76
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,320
Your mind goes somewhere else, but it didn't because it's still there.

77
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,940
I mean, obviously you have to be using it partially, but you're not feeling it so much.

78
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,640
You don't know.

79
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,340
Actually, they do go by feeling because what happens here, the emo, let's say you're a

80
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,780
truck driver.

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,280
You get in a truck, your emo changes and it has to change.

82
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,120
Even if you're pissed off about something, you still overlap the emo that it takes to

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,880
drive a truck.

84
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,660
And the emo then puts the, you know, the autopilot going, right?

85
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,240
That's why I'm going to, well, how many times have we talked about the emo, like full episodes?

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,880
And I don't think I, by the way, the O and G is not included.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,620
I don't think I really brought up the emo during the O and G a while back.

88
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:31,920
Did I?

89
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,180
No, not during those runs.

90
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
We never got into it.

91
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,480
No.

92
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,120
Yeah.

93
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,380
Yeah.

94
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,560
Right.

95
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,200
But in these runs at least three.

96
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

97
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,520
At least three.

98
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,060
Pretty heavy.

99
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes.

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,740
Yeah.

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah.

102
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,520
Yeah.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah.

104
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,040
One thing, just to, you can't say this enough.

105
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,320
When you say emo and expand it into emotions and purposes of emotions, it has nothing to

106
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,380
do with what we've been raised on about emotions.

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,820
Nothing to do.

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,820
Actually, this little point I gave about the autopilot is an emo function.

109
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
It is an emo.

110
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Give you an example.

111
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,100
In basic driving school, they tell you if you're emotionally wrought or upset or mad,

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,100
don't get behind a wheel.

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

114
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,220
Right. That's true. Yeah. No, if you're upset, you should not drive. Right. I mean, I've

115
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,500
seen that before when people are profoundly upset. They've just gotten some really bad

116
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,399
news or whatever. No, don't go driving right now.

117
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,740
Well, what does that have to do with basic motor skills and rationale? A lot, because

118
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,580
it's an emo function. Yeah. Well, that's the thing is that, look, the weirdest part about

119
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,980
this is it affects everything. And yet nobody ever gives you any sort of map on it. They

120
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,520
just they recognize it's there, generally speaking, not not in the conversations you

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,760
and I have had, but they'll generally recognize it. They're OK. You have your feelings. You're

122
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,740
in your feelings, you know, whatever. They got lots of all the hold on back. Let's go

123
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,640
back in the past. You interviewed what he goes by Miller, Richard, Richard Allen, Miller,

124
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,980
Ram, Dr. Ram. They call him Dr. Ram. Sure. All the stuff he talks about is email based.

125
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,700
You know, you've got this and that. I'm not a fan, by the way. I've been on private Skype

126
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,580
calls with him and that's why. But anyway, I'm not a fan, but I've heard him talk about

127
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,600
he doesn't simplify it enough like we are. I'm not saying we're better. Actually, we are.

128
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,340
But let's just say it this way. Yeah. His whole premise is based on that. You know, when he

129
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,400
says he was training the seals or whatever and he says it's all by the gut. Yeah. Well,

130
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,260
it's not. The gut is still physical. It's the emo or resides. Actually, you know, do

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,440
you want to know where it projects from? We never got into this right at the base of the sternum.

132
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,840
Like you just just drag your hand. Maybe I'm not using the right technical term. Actually,

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,980
believe it. I have to look that one up. Drag your finger down your your chest right where the bone

134
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,120
with the rib, the top ribs meet right before the stomach starts right there is where it generates

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,960
where it comes from. Right around where the diaphragm is about. Well, hi. Just as soon as you

136
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,960
vertically drag your hand down your chest, you feel all the bone mass as soon as you clear the

137
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,580
bone mass and it gets soft and tender. That's where it is. OK, that helps, you know. By the

138
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,200
way, the third eye thing is not what they tell you, either. It's, you know, a Vindhi point.

139
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,040
They put in Hindu culture, any culture. They put the spot between the eyes. Right. Vindhi.

140
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:25,400
OK, well, it goes the third eye energy goes right through. So it also is in the back of your head,

141
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,500
not just the front. People think it's you say I was to be sitting a socket on the front of

142
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,140
your head. Right. They think of it like a third eye in the center of your head. Yeah. Yeah. Or

143
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,300
it's a socket. It looks forward. No, that's it's actually an axis that goes right through the head

144
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,000
here at the point where you would see in Hindi culture where they place the Vindhi mark.

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,940
Vindhi. Right. The red the red dots. Yeah. By the way, I had a cat that had a little it was

146
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:56,720
white and had a little dot right there called Vindhi. But anyway, why not? So. So, yeah,

147
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,740
these things have locations on the body. And does that help? OK, so if you know where it is,

148
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,060
does it make you more proficient? No, it doesn't actually, because it's nonphysical.

149
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,540
But every nonphysical thing, let's say you're going to broadcast. Right. It's nonphysical.

150
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,520
But you can actually go back to where it's broadcasting from. It is a physical antenna

151
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,340
pointing the type of antenna it is. Right. Well, it's got a point of origin from which

152
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,920
right energy is. Yeah. You know, emerges from first. Right. So and then it's then transferred

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,480
out via this, via that. Like you can see how it goes through a pipeline, basically. So that's

154
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,540
pretty much what you're doing here. Right. Yeah. By the way, the email part where it's right there

155
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,480
at the base, at the top part of the rib cage or bottom part of the rib cage. Did I mention that

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,240
was for men? No, I didn't. No, you didn't. Yeah. Mostly it's for men. For most women. It's there

157
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,440
also for women. But most women, it's the womb. It would be the top of the uterus where the where the

158
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,060
two fallopian tubes come out. I think that might be slightly lower than right on way lower. Yeah.

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah. It would be right about where if you stand up, put your thumbs on your hip bones about an

160
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,040
inch down below that. Oh, OK. OK. Much lower. Sorry. Yeah. Way lower. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a

161
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,120
reason for that. Again, I think I got into the reasons. It's similar to the reason why if you

162
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:26,500
look at the human bladder and anatomy on a drawing, it's has a symmetrical arrangement around it.

163
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,620
And it looks just like a uterus. Well, since the most men and women, since most things are cyclical,

164
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,220
one would almost think that maybe it would come from the the general area on the male then,

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,740
you know, if it's too, too far, too far removed. Remember the male's genitalia. Let me just say

166
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,520
this way might be contrary to scripture for most people. But the male genitalia are an afterthought.

167
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,940
Women came first, not men. And proof of that is that the testes are outside of the body for

168
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:01,620
temperature control. Why? Because the body's too hot for testicles. Right. So it's an afterthought.

169
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,700
So certain things are backwards. Well, no, I've never seen that represented in any of the stories

170
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,000
right where you have the you know, the male than the female. Always the male is created first.

171
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, let's just put it this way. If we go back to the biblical nomenclature. Yeah. Day six,

172
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,580
man and woman were made together. Doesn't tell you who was made first, does it? No,

173
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,120
they were made together and they were told to go repopulate, replenish, and they were giving

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,480
a blessing. And when I say when man was made to anyone, they go back to the Judeo-Christian

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,880
ethic, even Islam, where you have Adam. You know, he's the sucker. You know, he's the guy that was

176
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,240
made way later. Right. You know, he got punked. You know what I mean? OK, don't know. We're not

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,540
talking about the one in the garden. We're talking about. Right. The one before that was

178
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,760
we're talking six day, man, not a day, man. Yeah. Yeah. Because a day man is the one that they say

179
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,700
they took the rib from. They always say, yeah, yeah, it should have been an arm and a leg cost

180
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,200
too much. And that's why women are the way they are. They're made from a cheaper cut. You know,

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,540
so anyway, anyway. No, really. I mean, think about it. It doesn't you know,

182
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,860
it doesn't mean men are any better. I'm just saying Adam is made from a cheaper cut,

183
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,720
you know. But anyway, the whole well, if he wasn't, he wouldn't be fixed as a gardener.

184
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,820
That's was that was his job to mow the lawn, cut the shrubs, take the garbage out. Right.

185
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,320
I mean, you know, anyway, they didn't have, you know, girly magazines back then and they didn't

186
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,080
have Netflix back then. So they made a woman. Yeah, they were supposed to be the what was the

187
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,060
word, the term they always use for it, where you're supposed to take care of everything.

188
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,440
You're like the caretaker. Yeah, there you go. Was the idea behind it. What was the word that

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
you stewardship steward pretty much made? I think he was more like the janitor. Maybe,

190
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,620
maybe. But either way, it's about me. Yeah. I don't hold him in high,

191
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,720
high esteem, by the way. I don't venerate that guy, by the way, at all.

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,380
But that's another thing. Maybe a Greek, you're taking a little personal here.

193
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,220
Prove it. You know, I'm like, no, it's just sorry. So I voice my voice, what my opinion is. How many

194
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,100
times do I say this? My opinion? Almost never. Right. So, yeah, so that'll be determined. But

195
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,820
all right. Either way, you know, the Christ said, I'm the first Adam and the second Adam.

196
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,080
The first Adam is six day man, by the way, not, you know, the second one. So he was there for

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,260
that, too. But this is not a discussion on on those ancient writs, but it's I don't know what

198
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,140
discussion do we ever have? That's a discussion about anything. Anyway,

199
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,580
this is kind of like members of the way they talked about Seinfeld. It's the show about nothing.

200
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,380
Well, this is the stream of consciousness that you can never quite nail down.

201
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,140
You know, it's the same. Well, we brought yeah, we brought that up before intent and will. Right.

202
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,880
Will is always around. But your intent is only when you're conscious and working on it. Right.

203
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,480
That's true. So the thing is, you know, you know, you've seen even it's been immemorialized in film

204
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,660
where you have these prisoners, prisoners of war, and they have a will to break out of the prison.

205
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,040
Right. There's so many films done, especially in the 60s and 70s. Right. World War two stuff. Right.

206
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,520
There was a lot of those. Yeah. Yeah. So they have an intent to not be there. But the will

207
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,440
is to break out. And whether there are you ever notice like there'll be a scene where they're all

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,220
sleeping and someone wakes up and automatically it's like, what do I need to keep doing? Dig in

209
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,820
this tunnel. Right. That's will. Right. Day or night. Oh, sleep or awake. Right. You see,

210
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,780
it's it's will is very, very deep and very, very heavy. But that's I think we'll work on that as I

211
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:33,220
develop more of a how would you say when you have a foundation on it? Right. To discuss, because

212
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,100
right now I'm just pulling these things and saying, hey, these things, maybe if we can measure them

213
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,920
better, we can manage them better. Right. These are these are all rough drafts that we're

214
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,540
we're getting from, you know, feedback, you know, from the chat room and emails and whatever else

215
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,300
it is we get from people giving us an idea what it is they're hearing and what it is they want

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,200
to hear about. So we're roughing out a few things here, really unrated. Why? Which eventually

217
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,840
can turn into much more solidly organized stuff later.

218
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,540
And we were like, right. Just to say we saw anybody listening here, feel free to communicate

219
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,980
with either one of us right on what you'd like to get into. Oh, absolutely. And, you know, we've

220
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,180
given out the emails before. And obviously you can contact, you know, where where you are. You

221
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,880
should be all uncommon. Uncommon sense. Radio one at Gmail dot com. That's the personal email.

222
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,840
That's number one. Numeric one. Uncommon sense. Radio one at Gmail dot com. Numeric one for the

223
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Greek. And I guess you're just once they land on Ocelli dot com, they'll they'll sniff around,

224
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,840
right? Get it. You can click a little email thing there or you can send to info at Ocelli dot com

225
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,520
or you can send a blind JFK researcher at Gmail dot com. I read all those. So, you know, in any

226
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,620
place, everybody knows, you know, to to address when when they're writing to me about this,

227
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,500
they always say, you know, put in the title rated Y. So they've already figured that one out all by

228
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,200
themselves. I didn't even have to tell them. So, you know, and speaking of figuring it out,

229
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,620
I just want to throw this in just so we got that. I just want to say two things. I was driving on

230
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,520
autopilot. Not really. But anyway, I heard put on like an oldie station and the DJ says, oh,

231
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,400
I just read an article that the dinosaurs 66 million years ago were destroyed by an asteroid

232
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,120
and asteroid. The reason they died is because the plants couldn't grow because there's no sun for two

233
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,960
years. I always remember it being 60 million years. Now they're making it 66 million years.

234
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,200
Right. You see the numbers are developing. How did that six or six million years? Yeah,

235
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,100
it's all BS. But yeah. Yeah. So so and this guy's like, well, you know, these nerds,

236
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,580
they know how to figure things out. You know, I'm like, oh, my gosh. So the program is still going.

237
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,720
This was also after I left having a conversation with someone and this has happened in the past

238
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,220
few days when something when I'm in several different situations, different people don't

239
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,100
know each other, different situations. And I hear the same thing. I kind of bring it up on a rated

240
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,600
Y. Right. It's interesting. And what it was, was this is in two different conversations over a

241
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,620
span of a day. Some things were brought up. The subject matter is not relevant, but this is

242
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,800
relevant is they said, Greek, you're the only other person I ever heard say that. Right. Not

243
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,560
not you're the only person heard say that the only other person these people were specializing

244
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,140
in what they did. And I just want to bring that forward, because one thing about what we're doing,

245
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,020
the project here is most likely you're here. You hear things that no one else you won't hear from

246
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,480
anyone else or very rarefied. Maybe there might be some specialist. Right. Yes. That might do

247
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,940
something and come up with something and we might bring it forward. But we never get into the

248
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,580
conventional stuff. Like, I think right now, still, there's a big shit sandwich going on in

249
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,140
the Middle East. And if you actually study it, you know, the the Hamas is real thing.

250
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,820
This is the fall of 2023, which, by the way, we predicted was great accuracy, how it would go

251
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:16,960
down is following all of the rote media script lines, you know, the typical psychology and all

252
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,960
that stuff, right. And, and, you know, how the way the public is controlled through the media

253
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,760
is through scandal. Right. So even when there's no scandal, the absence of a scandal is actually

254
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,480
a scandal. You see, because people are used to it. So they're looking for something and it's becoming

255
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,760
so played down. You know, the dinosaurs, 66 million, 60 million, you know, so what's happening

256
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,320
is you're going to start seeing great reveals and a lot of stuff you hear with rated Y, O and G

257
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,980
and others, I'm sure that no one's paying attention. You know, in other words, the power

258
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,640
people in power, the puppets in power, I should put it this way. The puppets that you're being

259
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,380
told are in power are don't care anymore. No one cares anymore. And I wouldn't say it's going to

260
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,460
fall apart, but it's on autopilot. And it's really, really low grade presentation all across the board,

261
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:21,680
everything. Right. So it's, it's not not anything you should focus on, like, you know, here's the

262
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,900
thing. Fortunately, I don't get a lot of messages about political situations. And actually, I don't

263
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,420
get any because people that are, you know, they know, at least I've been fortunate, right? Right.

264
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,780
So if you don't have your own personal affairs in order where you have happiness in your personal

265
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,920
life, personal could be whatever, you have no reason to be worried about what's going on in

266
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,380
the world. Right. And we're talking about even hard times, you know, you can always find bliss.

267
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,840
I think I brought up the analogy once I know someone who manages personal funds, like,

268
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,880
who's that guy? He was in the 3 billion in personal funds, which is not a lot,

269
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,540
but it is a lot for one guy and his assistant to do that is 3 billion in personal funds.

270
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,660
Larry King emerges that he Ivanka Trump when she was alive. These are the people that he

271
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,760
started off by managing a Marcos. So the one with all the shoes.

272
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,340
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. So Imelda Marcos.

273
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Imelda was one of his clients and they passed away. So he started off with her and then expanded

274
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,540
into Larry King and Ivanka Trump, who I think they beat her up, threw her down a staircase last

275
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,240
year or something like that. Well, not Ivanka. You mean Ivana with Ivana Ivana, the first wife,

276
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,940
the real tacky looking one, the bleach blonde hair. Ivanka is the daughter. So sorry. Yeah.

277
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,460
The real the first wife that had the bleach blonde hair was obviously very tacky. Right, right.

278
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,560
They beat her. Yeah, that one. And so anyway, I bring this up because it's funny. Of course.

279
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,220
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm bringing this up because I see these these people are a spotlight

280
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,220
or are really wonky. You know, they're not really doing this. Absolutely. They're totally like that.

281
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,120
They're not like what they're shown at all. They're actually the opposite.

282
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,200
Well, because it's very much like in 1984. And I know you don't you don't really love the parallels

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,420
with the 1984 type stuff because that leads to a whole lot of trite crap that a lot of people

284
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,380
spit out. But it's true about this. You mean Orwell's? You mean the book? Yeah. Orwell's

285
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,180
book. Right. OK, got it. You know, because I was around in 1984 was a good year, actually.

286
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh, yeah. No, I so was I. But Eric Blair or, you know, whatever his name really was. It doesn't

287
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,400
matter. Nineteen eighty four stands up in this Goldstein and however many minutes of hate that

288
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,600
they put up on the screens absolutely stands true. That's that moment of outrage. That's

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,640
that moment of scandal. It's irrelevant, really. They tell you this is the enemy. They tell you

290
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,840
this is the one to be spurned. They tell you this is the evil one. You're supposed to get angry at

291
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,320
this guy, Goldstein. Nobody knows. But none of them are what they what they say. But I want to

292
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,820
go back to the financial guy. So when the whole thing went down in a way, he's like, oh, my

293
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,900
personal money, you know, the personal funds management, his own personal money went down by

294
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:07,200
like 50 percent. And he said, how am I going to survive? And I'm like, survive? What do you mean?

295
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,020
If everything is gone, all the shops are gone and I'm out of food and I'm crossing the street and I

296
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,840
see a blade of grass coming out of the median, I know I could survive. I don't think you're using

297
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,200
that word survival properly. No, survive is really a bizarre topic with those guys, because I mean,

298
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,000
like I was looking at a TV show recently where they have these billionaires battling with each

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,940
other. It's a fake TV show or whatever. But very interesting. The guy is defeated. He ends up with

300
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,020
$100 million. You know, and I'm not going to make it. Yeah. I'm like, I'm going to have to

301
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,560
rebuild from that hundred million dollars. Really? You could you couldn't spend that if you in other

302
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,220
words, living a regular human life. You couldn't spend that in a lifetime. I couldn't spend that.

303
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,720
My grandchildren wouldn't be able to spend that living. I mean, even with inflation, we'd probably

304
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,760
just about run it through in two generations if we just lived, you know, normal lives.

305
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,240
By the way, since we're jumping around in tangents back around that time, I was doing some

306
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,440
work with the mines and prospecting. I figured out a way to get around the BLM and all that stuff. It

307
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,740
was fun. And because I'm by the way, if people with problems in business and industry, sometimes

308
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,300
when they get ahold of me, I said, well, we could figure a way around that. I don't know exactly now,

309
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,620
but we will. But anyway, we got around the BLM rules, mining, all that. And we were still allowed

310
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,720
to do it. You know, we just went around the rules with technicality. Well, there's a guy that went

311
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:35,760
out. This is near the border of Idaho and Canada. I'd say about half an hour south of Canada. And we

312
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,760
needed a core. There's a mountain outcrop. And we sent someone that could take a core sample because

313
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,420
it was hard rock mining. You get it dig into the mines. You know, they have just like you dig a

314
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,140
well. You know, they send a big, long rod through and they bring up a core about two or three inches

315
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,460
wide. And you can and it has depth markers. So you know how deep you know what you find at whatever

316
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,660
depth. Right. It's like drilling with a post digger, but really quickly and pulling out just

317
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,260
that chunk. Exactly. So he gets up. There's no road. So he finally he's an expert at getting

318
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,780
something with tracks. You can't use wheels, these tracks, you know, like a tank or a bulldozer

319
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,740
got up. There was equipment set up. We didn't hear from him for about two weeks. And after that,

320
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,700
he's like, OK, I took some core samples of where you guys wanted. And he says just the core samples

321
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,900
that I pulled out of the mountain has enough material that I will be wealthy. My children

322
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,180
will be wealthy and my grandchildren will be wealthy from the metals that he pulled out just

323
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,900
from doing the sampling samples. Right. So essentially that mountain, that outcropping

324
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,840
was all platinum, all platinum. He pulled out like 400 pounds of platinum material. Right.

325
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:49,240
Almost pure. Right. And that whole project went south. And the project kind of went on. But

326
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,900
Monsanto owned. It turns out that this got out. It was a battle. Monsanto knew it. Monsanto was

327
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:03,180
right at Monsanto. One of their large agricultural processing plants was about a half hour east.

328
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,040
They had known about this for a long time. But when they found out someone went up there to

329
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,940
a core sample, they know what they found. And they moved in and then like nobody can go there.

330
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,140
Monsanto now strangely owned by Bayer Aspirin. But go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. But this is 2008.

331
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,440
And remember, Monsanto is part of DuPont and Monsanto got bigger than DuPont. That's where

332
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,360
the children get bigger than the parents. Right. Oh, yeah. Well, that's why I crack up that Bayer

333
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,200
bought it, because I thought nobody as Monsanto. But please go ahead. Well, they're still trying

334
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
to figure out, like after World War Two, when they broke up Germany, who owns water or whatever,

335
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,740
because it took 30 years to figure the paperwork on that. Because here's the thing. There's when

336
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:48,940
I was doing the water of Andreas Vecca. He's a gold medalist. East Germany. He won several gold

337
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,800
medals in gymnastics. He was always like in the same place where we were peddling water. He was

338
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,820
peddling his oils. Andreas Vecca. So he had to have been a winner in like the 60s, 70s or 80s

339
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,220
somewhere. He was in the 80s. Yeah. We're about he's a year younger than I. So he was a gold

340
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,300
medalist in the 80s. And whenever Germany came up, he was did not want to he was from there.

341
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,920
He did not want to talk about it at all. Listen, guys, you guys want to talk about my country,

342
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,860
but my country does not have a government has not a government a long time because they have what's

343
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,060
called an interim government. Right. Just like, for example, like Iraq, you know what they did

344
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,140
to Iraq. That's an that's not a Iraqi government. It's an interim government. It's a puppet

345
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:33,420
government. And so the people are very, very bitter about what's going on still. And in other words,

346
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,760
the situation it's been about 80 years. Well, let's just call it 70 some odd years. Let's just

347
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:46,000
go from look, 50, 70 plus years. And it still has not been mitigated. Right. Yeah. Well, you know,

348
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,700
and that's an interesting thing, too, because people talk about this concept of terrorism and

349
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,600
where it is people would strike back if they were being oppressed and whatnot. And I say to myself

350
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,080
all the time, I'm surprised you don't see a lot more Iraqi terrorists all over the place.

351
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,180
There are no terrorists. So it's it's all fabricated. There are no real terrorists.

352
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,080
But see, if there were real terrorists, they would come from Iraq.

353
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,780
Yeah, right. But let me just say it this way. There might be some real terrorists,

354
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,380
you know, like home, you know, whatever. But you'll never hear about them in the news.

355
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,100
No, everything that you see on TV is fabricated that way. And I brought this up in some old guys

356
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,100
as well. You mean that truck that overturned on I-95 is fabricated? No, no, you're not getting

357
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,820
it. The stuff that has political motivation, the stuff that has, again, political motivation,

358
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,980
that means you have to mobilize an army or buy more missiles from Raytheon or do more stuff to

359
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,380
the airport. No, all that's made up. All of it. Because there really is stuff that has gone down

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,360
years and years ago. I've mentioned this many times. Someone with a camera, which, by the way,

361
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,060
by the way, those smartphones are not phones or cameras that happen to be phones. Right. Because

362
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,900
you look at the quality of the pictures they take. So how many times in the past 10 years have you

363
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:00,740
seen stuff on YouTube where like, why are these low flying helicopters all over in the midtown of L.A.

364
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,260
Right. Or in Chicago, you got these Apache helicopters going back and forth and some,

365
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,880
they closed off some streets and all that. And so they call the Pentagon, they call the D.O.D.,

366
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,960
they call the local military. No answer. No answer. No answer for like a day. Right. And then

367
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,560
a day later, say, oh, we were having a drill. Right. That's something that they write. That's

368
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,860
a real event. But you but did they come out and tell you it was a terrorist? No, it was a drill.

369
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,780
Coincidentally, when they tell you there's a terrorist event,

370
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,200
guess what was scheduled to happen that time? Anyway, a drill.

371
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,220
Right. 9-11 was a drill. The Air Force was doing a drill that morning. Multiple drills all over.

372
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,420
Yeah. The bus bombing in England about 10 years ago. Right. They blew up some bus. That was a

373
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,440
drill. 7-7. Yeah. The one in Spain. That was a drill. That was the train. That was a train.

374
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,580
There was the buses and it was the bus and the train was Spain and the bus was in England. Can

375
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,260
you write a children's song about it? Yeah, they did. They did both in England. They had the bus

376
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,380
and the train and the bus and the train. And in Spain it was just a train. Right. Yeah. But these

377
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,880
are all drills. So but but when it really goes down, guess what? They're totally silent. And

378
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,000
it's a drill. And again, does it make it to the mainstream media? It might for like half a second,

379
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,820
you know, or a minute, 30 seconds. By the way, all those choppers people record on their phones,

380
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:29,920
you know, that was a drill. OK, next thing. Right. So there is stuff happening, you know,

381
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,820
but it's not happening the way you write. And now, yeah, there's no reason to talk about the

382
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,940
covid scam and all that, because if you don't understand the AIDS thing, you'll never understand

383
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,480
the covid thing. That's right. There is no. Yeah. It's the treatment that makes you sick. So.

384
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,660
All right, man. Yeah. I mean, that's that's just the way it is. But but I'm telling you,

385
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,600
there were real terrorists, though they could come from a place where people have been stepped

386
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,180
on a while. And yeah, eventually they will react. Right. They'll lash out when you give people

387
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,960
nothing to lose. They might come and lash out at the people they think are responsible for that.

388
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,900
That's a real thing. But it is. But it doesn't happen because as you you have to be able to

389
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,360
afford an air ticket. Well, there's the other thing is sorry, but it's not walking depressed.

390
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,400
I mean, look, there's people in America. Look, I can't stand it. They go, oh, well,

391
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,800
all you got to do is move to another state. Well, what if you don't have the resources to move to

392
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,420
another state? They if they're going to if regular, quote, unquote, people that have been stepped on

393
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,200
anywhere in the world that want to do something here or Europe or whatever, you need a tremendous

394
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,740
amount of funds to pull it off and help from the inside. Right. So, again, it's artificial.

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,180
It just doesn't happen. But it does happen. There's some people that do some really stupid

396
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,240
stuff. And the helicopters flying low, mid city and all that. That's a drill. You know,

397
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,200
it does happen. I can investigate that. I still might be able to revive some contacts,

398
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,640
special people that but I don't need to poke around because it's intuitive at this point.

399
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,640
There you go.
