1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,800
Sonic Event 207, Rated Y, here

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,780
we are and you know, I was just

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,780
thinking because my head is kind of ringing

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,240
and hurting, I remember some cool advice you

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,740
gave me a while ago about headaches and

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,320
I want to point this out real fast.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,420
Sometimes when you get a tension headache, it

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,080
is good and I just did relieve a

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,460
little part of it with my thumb in

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,080
between where my eyebrows are.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,300
Or if you take that and sort of

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,920
go vertically upward, it does help with certain

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,640
kinds of headaches.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah, that's the liver line, you know, I

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,360
mean in between the over the nose.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,160
Yeah, but that's not the only way to

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,400
go.

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,220
But that is one of them that does

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,460
help.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,440
Headache is expansive energy running towards the top

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,380
of the body, right?

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,220
So yeah, so that means the pressure, pressure

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,640
would be at the joints would be at

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,980
the base of the jaw, anywhere on the

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,480
neck, because it's vertebrae, right?

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,680
As long as the neck is relaxed, tilt

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,700
your head slightly to one side, you know,

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,280
you want to close the joint, you bend

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,800
the joints.

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,080
So yeah, well, when you do that, we'll

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,000
get into that some other time.

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,440
Well, we are going to get into the

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,940
body toward the end of this one today,

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,340
but I just figured I'd mentioned that.

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:15,880
We'll preface.

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,620
Yeah, we'll preface it because this one's going

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,360
to be a little shorter.

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
So you can get some rest and the

39
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,080
next one will get more into the body,

40
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,320
which is going to be more of the

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,800
usual, right, right.

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,480
And, you know, the reason why that works

43
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,620
for me, though, also is because I have

44
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,120
expansion in the eyes a lot.

45
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,780
My eyes actually change size.

46
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,860
They swell a bit, which I know sounds

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,440
weird to people.

48
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,940
But everybody's don't do that.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,100
But mine's a little more extreme.

50
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,900
So that's why that works.

51
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,060
Marty Feldman style.

52
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,240
Not so bad.

53
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,240
No, it's it's this little deformity where my

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
eyes are slightly misshapen for the socket.

55
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,160
It's an odd little genetic defect, apparently.

56
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah.

57
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,700
Anyway, putting all that aside, I got a

58
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,240
couple of questions from the Patreon people, and

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,880
it is weird.

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,260
A couple of questions, a couple of comments

61
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,500
real fast, and they are inspired by some

62
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,760
of the stuff that was said during some

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,280
of the sonics.

64
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,300
But this one is not.

65
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,660
And I'll start with this one.

66
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,700
Could the Greek discuss underground beings and civilizations?

67
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,260
Now, that's a wide open question because you're

68
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,840
always talking about the surface dwelling inhabitants.

69
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Obviously, that's the majority of people listening to

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,300
this.

71
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,820
We think.

72
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,100
Yeah.

73
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,200
No, I can't.

74
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,460
I have no firsthand anything.

75
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,780
Well, we could not really know.

76
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,120
They would come up if they would come

77
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,440
up to the surface and they look almost

78
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,220
sapient.

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,700
I would if I were them, I would

80
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,440
put on like electrical service or, you know,

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,260
civil workers with the vests and the hard

82
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,940
hat in the streets.

83
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
No one notices you.

84
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,220
Right.

85
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,480
Or look homeless.

86
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,440
That's the closest I can discuss them.

87
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,980
There's a lot of testimonies.

88
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,040
And believe it or not, the more mythological

89
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,560
and the older the story is, the more

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,320
accurate for the general situation, you know, because

91
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
there's tendencies, you know, like now everything's a

92
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
reptilian or a gray or whatever.

93
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,480
You know, when they talk about little gnomes

94
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,700
and stuff like that, you may not want

95
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,300
to go with how they're featured, you know,

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,700
but the idea that they're a foot tall.

97
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah.

98
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,020
Go with that.

99
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,280
And their characteristics, you know, because they definitely

100
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,900
change the appearances when they put them out

101
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,680
to the public or, you know, a red

102
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,980
haired giant, six finger giant living in a

103
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,740
cave in Afghanistan.

104
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,300
Yeah.

105
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,520
You know.

106
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,160
But, you know, I have no I you

107
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,180
have to scour everything that's out there with

108
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,040
a high level of discernment and intuition.

109
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,780
Right.

110
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,840
You got to have intuition.

111
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,040
Speaking of discernment, weird thing happened this week.

112
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,340
And I know you don't watch the news,

113
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,320
but you know how you talked often about

114
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,220
how everybody you see out there is actually

115
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,700
a clone.

116
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,460
It's not the real guy anymore or anything.

117
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Oh, Trump is putting out Trump's people that

118
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,200
Biden is a clone.

119
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,480
Yeah.

120
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,880
OK.

121
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,900
So you know about that.

122
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,280
And he supports that idea.

123
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,020
Of course, these people are doing it for

124
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,000
very weird reasons.

125
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,620
But do you think they're right for the

126
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,180
wrong reasons?

127
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,460
Because they got the wrong evidence.

128
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,560
But are they right?

129
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,520
Yeah.

130
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,680
Well, you can't show that.

131
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,600
It's like 9-11.

132
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,320
They say, well, it's an inside job and

133
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,880
they use thermite and they got the wrong

134
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,720
evidence because thermite is so slow.

135
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,959
The towers would still be burning with thermite

136
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,520
20 years later to get 200000 tons turned

137
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,100
into dust.

138
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,740
Thermite, by the way, not change the subject.

139
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,620
That's a very I first hand experience with

140
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,740
it.

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,020
If you know people who have been on

142
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,340
the railroad or if you have a heavy

143
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,580
piece of steel, when they have to mend

144
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,480
a piece of the railroad, you know, you

145
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,700
know, most people have not seen a railroad

146
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,780
rail up close, you know, one foot section

147
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,860
of that weighs like twenty five thirty pounds.

148
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,100
Right.

149
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,220
And when they need to weld them, they

150
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,520
put this green it's called green clay or

151
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,460
very fire proof clay around the joint and

152
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,980
they pack it with thermite and set it

153
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,520
on fire.

154
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
And in about forty five minutes, it's welded.

155
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:58,820
Right.

156
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,140
So let's go back to the evidence about

157
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,500
clones.

158
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,300
They're never going to put out how simple

159
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,200
it is to clone.

160
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,700
Right.

161
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,920
They always you need a special lab and

162
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,380
special whatever.

163
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,140
No, what I'm saying is even their proof

164
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,580
for saying that he's a clone is B

165
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,260
.S. Like they've got this thing of he's

166
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,660
taller.

167
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,880
He's so much taller than Joe Biden.

168
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,240
You know, he's like seven feet tall.

169
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,260
They didn't do that.

170
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,260
That's a weird look at the camera.

171
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,220
I didn't get any of that.

172
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,940
I just saw.

173
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,340
I kind of look for what Donald Marshall's

174
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,980
been posting and there's SWOT or something.

175
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,140
If you don't have a Twitter account, someone

176
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,700
has it closed off this thing like bores

177
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
in there and you could it acts as

178
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,140
if you have a Twitter account to view

179
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,500
things.

180
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,060
Oh, yeah.

181
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,620
And I saw the posting there and I

182
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,200
was like, great, you know, he's vindicated.

183
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,200
But they're never going to get into any

184
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,540
legally.

185
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,480
An accusation is considered prima facie evidence.

186
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,180
Right.

187
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,040
Right.

188
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,920
That's why, you know, if something is put

189
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,980
out and it's not rebutted.

190
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,180
Here's the here's the thing.

191
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,320
If you want to see validity, more validity

192
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,120
in the issue, did anyone on the Biden

193
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,480
camp rebut it or is it just one

194
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,800
sided?

195
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,980
Well, they, you know, they kind of have

196
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,020
laughed at the official Biden camp.

197
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
No, his defenders are.

198
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,020
OK, so then we have to take it

199
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,180
as prima facie evidence.

200
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Now, the media laughing at it, whatever is

201
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,580
not whatever is, in other words, there's clearly

202
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,020
an opposition here and the opposition would be

203
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,760
the Biden camp, because I think most of

204
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
this was put out by the Trump camp,

205
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,540
maybe not Trump himself.

206
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,820
So he just reposted it on his truth

207
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,500
social thing.

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
That's what he did.

209
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,400
All right.

210
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,980
Hmm.

211
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Yeah.

212
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,060
So.

213
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
So is he's acquiescing to it?

214
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,240
Right.

215
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
But we've we've discussed it in cloning.

216
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,300
Just to recap on cloning years ago, there

217
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,000
was a Midwest nightly news, 6 p.m.

218
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,100
local news about a center that grew skin

219
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,820
for people.

220
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,320
And the reporter goes in there and basically

221
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,460
says it's basically cloning their own skin.

222
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,680
And he has these flasks, the kind you

223
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,840
see in eighth grade science.

224
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,400
And his table is vibrate is not vibrating,

225
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,160
but it's rotating.

226
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,420
It's on an eccentric gear.

227
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,820
So it goes back and forth in a

228
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,580
circle at about one inch, you know, off

229
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,120
of center.

230
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
And it's just rotating.

231
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,920
Look, you see mixers in labs that rotate

232
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,500
right or mix, you know, by moving the

233
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,000
beaker.

234
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
He has all these beakers on there.

235
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,640
And he says we put a special it's

236
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
mostly water with a special solution of minerals

237
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
and other things like that with some cells.

238
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,660
And within a few days, sometimes a week

239
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,200
or two, we have a skin sample and

240
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,300
he shows the skin sample.

241
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,700
It's like a translucent piece.

242
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,920
He stretches on a thing and he cuts

243
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,060
it.

244
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,140
And it's basically cloning.

245
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
This is not something you get at a

246
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,960
regular hospital.

247
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,160
It's more of an elitist.

248
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,500
You know, it's like the kind of people

249
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,040
that, you know, they can be considered on

250
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,360
the level of plastic surgery.

251
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,780
Right.

252
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,800
It's like in the 30s and 40s, they

253
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,280
did the thing where they grew, you know,

254
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,940
where they actually scrape the skin off you

255
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,540
with something that almost looks like one of

256
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,760
those cheese knives that like literally scrapes the

257
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,160
skin off.

258
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,820
They would take that, grow it and put

259
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,240
it on a piece of a burnt skin.

260
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,680
That kind of tech wasn't available to the

261
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
general public for a long time, but was

262
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,140
available if you had the cash.

263
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,360
But this was not scraping.

264
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
And they typically take it off your buttocks

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
or your thigh or something.

266
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,120
That's been around.

267
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,960
I remember a while.

268
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,240
Right.

269
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,600
Right.

270
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,700
But this is literally cloning from, you know,

271
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,740
undiscernible, you know, very small size cells.

272
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,120
And it's very simple.

273
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,720
And also there was another news thing in

274
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,440
the early 2000s where they found an Egyptian

275
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,040
mummy that was a clone.

276
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,640
Right.

277
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,640
And then most people took it that they're

278
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,320
cloning Egyptian mummies now.

279
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,260
No, no, no, no.

280
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
The Egyptian mummy did not have, you know,

281
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,720
born from a woman type genetics.

282
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,220
It was cloned back then and mummified.

283
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,880
And that was and then it was erased.

284
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,740
And so the technology is very, very, very

285
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,520
rudimentary.

286
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,520
And it is something you can do in

287
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
your kitchen.

288
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm very big on, you know, promoting techniques

289
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,600
and things.

290
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,380
You know, years ago, we were doing Skype

291
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,780
groups, a guy from Australia.

292
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,760
I don't remember his name.

293
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,380
Doesn't matter.

294
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,140
He was an IP guy.

295
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,020
He would find like intellectual property and try

296
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,800
to find investors.

297
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,160
And he would always be excited to tell

298
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,580
us about all the latest IP that was

299
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,560
not, you know, secret.

300
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,840
And I was like, wait a second, tell

301
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
me something I could whip up in my

302
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,760
kitchen.

303
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,260
Not not like, so you need a three

304
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,320
million dollar or whatever.

305
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
You know, they always tell you these new

306
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,360
scientific things are always coming out.

307
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,640
Oh, MIT lab or this or that, you

308
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,740
know, all this specialized equipment.

309
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,580
What about stuff you can do at home?

310
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,840
They never discuss that.

311
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,340
And by the way, cloning can be done

312
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,840
at home.

313
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,320
Right.

314
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,520
Because the only things they would try to

315
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,000
show you is stuff like like, look, if

316
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
you had a server farm, you could become

317
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,180
a millionaire overnight with, you know, and it's

318
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,980
like, yeah, but who has a server farm,

319
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,480
you know?

320
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,040
Well, yeah, it's a matter of, you know,

321
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,000
what can you do?

322
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,360
That's why, you know, practical stuff.

323
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,360
So what else you got?

324
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,480
OK, so let's see.

325
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,060
Gender switching, because we talked about that recently

326
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,760
a few times.

327
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,460
Gender switching is the priest class.

328
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,460
It's always men to women because that's the

329
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,820
ritual.

330
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,700
Europa, the last battle, speaks about the times

331
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,680
after World War One that we never hear

332
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,080
about.

333
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,120
So they were starting this back then.

334
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,940
Everybody thinks it's a brand new thing, but

335
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,020
it's not brand new.

336
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,380
Yeah.

337
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,860
Yeah.

338
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,120
Well, no, yeah, it's no.

339
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,500
The whole thing about conquering the sex is,

340
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,220
you know, the idea of why having sex

341
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,100
is by conquering it simply by just switching

342
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,300
it.

343
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,460
Right.

344
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
So you have a group that, let's say,

345
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,620
has the concept on display of conquering, you

346
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,240
know, the natural male female counterpart.

347
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
You know, we're going to conquer that by

348
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,140
just simply having a male dress up like

349
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,560
a female and a female dress up like

350
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,860
a male.

351
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,100
Typically, it goes male to female.

352
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,640
Typically.

353
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,280
Right.

354
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,820
That was the easy way to start with.

355
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,080
But now we've gotten into the surgeries and

356
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,180
the whole bit, you know, with surgeries have

357
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,960
always been around also to a degree.

358
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,160
OK, that's a good degree.

359
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,080
That's the underground.

360
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,460
There was castration and there was full castration

361
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,180
where the penis is cut off to write

362
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,580
a lot of a lot of I think

363
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,540
the Knights Templar had a ritual for that

364
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,000
and whatever.

365
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,500
There was castration and full castration, which is,

366
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,700
you know, the organ itself.

367
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,020
Right.

368
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,180
I didn't ask you about the bunions last

369
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,080
time, did I?

370
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,660
No, no, as in somebody.

371
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah, well, somebody asked to avoid the involvement

372
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,920
of any medical technician.

373
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,200
Does Greek have any experience to share with

374
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,300
correcting bunions?

375
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
No, no.

376
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,400
And that's a very broad subject.

377
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,300
OK, very broad.

378
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,400
And it would be no, I'll look into

379
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,480
let's just say this.

380
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm not going to make a note of

381
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,100
it, you know, write it down, but I'll

382
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,780
make a note of looking at it and

383
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,800
bring it up again.

384
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,640
I got you, because in the medical technician

385
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,780
field, you know, it's it's all about nowadays.

386
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,940
They they break your foot and they correct

387
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,280
it and then they say, OK, now that's

388
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,160
how we get rid of the bunion.

389
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,580
You know, they actually cut the extra piece

390
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,580
off and they break it.

391
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,900
They break the bone and reset it, which

392
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
seems actually sensible in a way.

393
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
But it also means that it's going to

394
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,540
come back.

395
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,080
Most likely.

396
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,420
Yeah.

397
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,220
Or you can have a bracing system.

398
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,780
It'll be very, very uncomfortable.

399
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:58,900
Yeah.

400
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,120
And that takes a lot of races and

401
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,480
all that.

402
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,780
You know.

403
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,400
So, yeah.

404
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,860
Yeah.

405
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,300
The same thing happens with people with the

406
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,100
hump on the back to, you know, like

407
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,820
where they get the the back and they

408
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,060
start bending over more and more to a

409
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,460
question mark as they get older, especially taller

410
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,900
people.

411
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,340
Yeah.

412
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,380
Yeah.

413
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,680
It's always self-esteem and sort of like

414
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
anger manifest like it's held in internally.

415
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,420
By the way, if you want to counterbalance

416
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,680
anger issues, fermented foods.

417
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,620
Hmm.

418
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,280
Give you an example, like if someone's holding

419
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,060
a grudge, right.

420
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,860
What happens when they drink alcohol and get

421
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,580
drunk?

422
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,240
The wine.

423
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,080
Yeah.

424
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
They they want any kind of fermented food.

425
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,860
We'll do that.

426
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,140
Yeah.

427
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,740
So anyway.

428
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,380
OK, what else?

429
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,080
Nice.

430
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,460
OK.

431
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,420
Last thing.

432
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,680
OK.

433
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,060
And let's talk about depression.

434
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,040
As I know, it isn't what we think

435
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,580
it's.

436
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,300
It is, you know, mentioned in previous sonics

437
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,500
as unmet expectations.

438
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,120
So how do we just get over the

439
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,620
reality of and the reality of depression and

440
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,060
be happy?

441
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
This is what I've been saying about depressions

442
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,940
for 40 years now, is when people try

443
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,920
to mix cognitive mix, a cognitive mix of

444
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
fact and fiction.

445
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,780
And we're going to give you an example.

446
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,220
When you get too much of this stuff,

447
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,820
like if the bank lends you money, where

448
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,700
did the bank get it from?

449
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,660
Don't ask that.

450
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,540
Right.

451
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,580
Because, you know, but if no one wants

452
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,880
to talk about it, it means it doesn't

453
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,260
exist where Santa Claus and, you know, the

454
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,120
children, you know, Santa Claus, this and Santa

455
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,720
Claus, that.

456
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
And then they're told to ask for Santa

457
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
Claus when they reach a certain age.

458
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't ask for that anymore.

459
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
What's wrong with you?

460
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,080
Right.

461
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,440
Right.

462
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,440
You're an adult now.

463
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,460
So when you're mixing cognitively, forward thinking, mixing,

464
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,280
asking questions about things that are fictional or,

465
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
you know, you won't get an answer for

466
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,300
because, you know, it's the liability is the

467
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,440
biggest source of depression when you try to

468
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,200
mix the two.

469
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,440
Yeah.

470
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,900
Fair enough.

471
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,980
So meanwhile, you also said you were going

472
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,900
to do a sort of a a preliminary

473
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
on the on the body to get us

474
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,780
started before we actually get into it during

475
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,280
a sonic.

476
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,920
So, yeah, where would you begin with that?

477
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,340
I mean, I guess you begin with the

478
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,900
most relatable thing, like you say.

479
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,160
But yeah, anatomy, you got to look at

480
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,540
anatomy.

481
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
Like, for example, if you I don't have

482
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,800
it from sitting outside in a pergola having

483
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,860
a smoke and some coffee.

484
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,340
Sure.

485
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,600
I was I was going to do this

486
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,500
one dry with no smokes and no coffee.

487
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,860
I said, no, let's get it.

488
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,000
So look, it's what's called like a sweat

489
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,340
duct.

490
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,740
It's in the form of a coil.

491
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,760
Looks like a little spring, OK, because you

492
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,080
need that surface area and that shape to

493
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,160
create that counter space for water to be

494
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,220
created in the duct.

495
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,480
Right.

496
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,380
They also they do show sweat ducts and

497
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,640
they avoid showing that coil.

498
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,720
And so, you know, if you show too

499
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,480
much right and you see people start seeing

500
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,300
patterns and they're going to see that pattern

501
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,120
actually belongs to a certain function, then they're

502
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,820
going to try to associate the functions.

503
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,080
And we were not supposed to do that.

504
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,260
Right.

505
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,920
Meaning induction.

506
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,800
If you look at anything that generates liquid

507
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,360
has to be done with this coil.

508
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,440
And right.

509
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,740
I mean, mostly not always.

510
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,120
But but in this case, it's so efficient

511
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,380
to do it that way, because how long

512
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,400
does it take for someone to start leaking

513
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,360
pretty quickly?

514
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,800
Sometimes, you know, I mean, sweating.

515
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,360
Right.

516
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,180
You know what they call you're leaking, right?

517
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,660
Well, you leak with the sweating, but you

518
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,380
also leak with what they call the milk

519
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,440
ducts, you know, with women.

520
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,140
And sometimes men do that, too.

521
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,040
They call it a witch's milk or whatever.

522
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,800
Milk ducts.

523
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,140
Yes.

524
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,080
Yes.

525
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,460
You'll find those are more glandular looking like

526
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,300
cauliflower bunched up again, large surface area.

527
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,380
And those require a different form of energy.

528
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,740
Right.

529
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
So the the sweat duct is is a

530
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
very from universal principles.

531
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,680
It's narrow.

532
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,140
It's very young, very focused and very, very

533
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,240
neat little spiral.

534
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,920
You find that in small induction.

535
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,220
Look, look, look up mini inductors for electrical

536
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,740
circuits.

537
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,460
Is this identical?

538
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,960
Right.

539
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
It's a very inefficient system if you're going

540
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,820
to pull liquid from the blood or the

541
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,080
skin.

542
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,640
And also you see the dermal layers around

543
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,080
the sweat duct.

544
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,720
There's no way moisture, water will be going

545
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,420
through that because the interstitial spaces are so

546
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,820
tight.

547
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,200
Right.

548
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,040
It's it's pretty much like a low durometer

549
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,840
rating rubber.

550
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,620
There's nothing that's going to go through that.

551
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,600
So you can see how that's produced.

552
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,720
The other thing is to look at how

553
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,340
the organs are packed together.

554
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,680
There is a sequence there.

555
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,380
You know, it's very when you look at

556
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,940
I remember in grade school, we had the

557
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,500
the disassembly person remember was a torso and

558
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,800
the organs came off and they snapped back

559
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,020
on.

560
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,700
Do you remember that?

561
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,040
I didn't see him in school later, but

562
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,720
yeah, yeah.

563
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah, it was a physical or you said,

564
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,840
oh, you see everything neatly snaps together.

565
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,660
Now, one thing that I when I saw

566
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,300
that at a young age, I said, oh,

567
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,900
look, it's a whole bunch of aliens that

568
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,360
are in contract to work together.

569
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,060
I mean, because the liver couldn't be more

570
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,800
alien than your, you know, kidney and more

571
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,220
alien than your pancreas or more alien than

572
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,680
anything else.

573
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,920
There are many different cells.

574
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,380
Any of those things are completely different.

575
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,180
Yeah.

576
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,380
Each organ comes from another planet, you know.

577
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,200
So, you know, so to speak.

578
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,880
So they're all in concert working together like

579
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,619
off the shelf parts, right, that were made

580
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,480
to work together.

581
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
And the way that they're all nestled together,

582
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,260
it has its own little Fibonacci arrangement, golden

583
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,640
mean.

584
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,319
And that's because you need that or it's

585
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,520
almost a requirement to have that golden mean

586
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
proportion to take advantage of the energy, right?

587
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,980
That's how energy flows.

588
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,060
Anyone who does ham radio understands the length

589
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,660
of the antenna is critical to your tuning

590
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,160
and all that.

591
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,760
So, yeah, I think any woman who's ever

592
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,000
had a C-section is fully aware of

593
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,460
how weird it is when they put things

594
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,980
back in.

595
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,460
They kind of don't do it exactly the

596
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,920
right way.

597
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
You get problems later because they literally take

598
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,960
your organs out to get toward, you know,

599
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,660
where the sack is, where the kid is

600
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,640
or the child is.

601
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
And it's this whole thing.

602
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,740
And then they just sort of put the

603
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,560
organs back in.

604
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,140
I don't think they always put them back

605
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,900
in exactly right.

606
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,240
Yeah.

607
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,940
And what is it like?

608
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,920
90% of them are are unnecessary now.

609
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah, just do it because the hospital bill

610
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
and the, you know, keep the doctors working,

611
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,020
you know, right.

612
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,840
And it's quick, quick recovery, allegedly, you know.

613
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,900
Oh, my gosh.

614
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,180
Yeah.

615
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,820
So it's it's a horrible.

616
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
But, you know, here here's the thing.

617
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,300
You don't have to say the medical industry

618
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,760
is horrible state right now.

619
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,980
And this is how it's going to get

620
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,340
worse.

621
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,580
You don't have that much time for it

622
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,760
to get much worse, which is a good

623
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,340
thing, right?

624
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,720
So, yeah, when you look at the human

625
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,860
body and the way it's assembled and the

626
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,560
structure, by the way, one thing I mentioned,

627
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,620
I did plug into chat GPT a while

628
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,360
back is water.

629
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,900
Water is not H2O and chat GPT agreed

630
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,600
only for certain chemical.

631
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,900
Right.

632
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,240
Whatever.

633
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,460
Anyway.

634
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,900
But if you put in the human body

635
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,700
or any biological organism has a biological vacuum,

636
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,340
it emphatically says, no, there is no biological

637
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,860
vacuum.

638
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,480
There are pressures in the right.

639
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,140
So then how does if you ask the

640
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,500
how does all of the fluid, you know,

641
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,320
stay in equals, you know, stays in pretty

642
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,880
much equilibrium through the body, right through the

643
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
pressure of the organs?

644
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,880
You know, it gives you a really ridiculous

645
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,180
answer.

646
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,220
It seems like they really picked up on

647
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,720
that and fed the A.I. something to

648
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,120
emphatically disagree with.

649
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,320
I couldn't get around it.

650
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,680
You know, so they really don't want you

651
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,440
sort of like if you ask the question,

652
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
all debts belong to show me, you know,

653
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,380
don't show me the laws.

654
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,420
All debts belong to United States says no.

655
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,440
Actually, there's about a dozen laws that say

656
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
they do.

657
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,520
So there are certain things that are put

658
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,000
in there to whitewash or block, because typically

659
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,040
all it does is it tries to rephrase

660
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,560
its rephrase what you're saying.

661
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,920
It doesn't really give info.

662
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,860
I mean, unless it's you're looking for reference

663
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,340
material.

664
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,800
But there's a major denial or non acknowledgement

665
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,120
of the biological vacuum.

666
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,020
And once you start, we're aware of it.

667
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,260
And the basic principles of everything being sucked

668
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,220
inward by, let's say, a force, whether it's

669
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,520
moving or not in motion or not is

670
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,640
not relevant is that that that vacuum, that

671
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,900
negative pressure inside all living things, even seeds

672
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,740
exists to a degree that it shouldn't be

673
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,220
ignored.

674
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,540
And it needs to be acknowledged.

675
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,000
And understanding how to work with the biological

676
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,700
vacuum, of course, will lead to, you know,

677
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,820
I guess most things miraculously healing or, you

678
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,800
know, advantageous to like very, very rapid healing.

679
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,180
Yeah.

680
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,180
And they they have some, you know, they

681
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,060
the the legal system, the medical system, the

682
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,880
monetary system are interlinked, right?

683
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,280
Very much interlinked.

684
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,340
So certain things are verboten, right?

685
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,260
Forbidden to discuss in general queries is with

686
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,420
the eye or on the Internet.

687
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,120
You know, they're hidden.

688
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,380
They what do they call it?

689
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,980
The algorithm.

690
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,540
Yeah.

691
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,220
Right.

692
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,420
And you can find that when you go

693
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,100
and you try and do the Google and

694
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,280
it gives you the answer to anything that

695
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,700
you ask.

696
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,440
Like if you ask a general question to

697
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,660
Google, you're getting an A.I. driven.

698
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,080
Yeah, they want to get away with.

699
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,060
So, you know, years, let's say 10 years

700
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,720
ago, you did a question and it did

701
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,220
it statistically when, you know, your question showed

702
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,160
up in websites and all that number crunching.

703
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,460
Yeah.

704
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,320
They eventually it'll be you're just dealing with

705
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,380
an A.I. like Star Trek.

706
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,720
There is no other websites.

707
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,680
You don't get websites or whatever, only the

708
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,560
featured websites.

709
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,540
And it'll get to the point where because

710
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,300
A.I. is intellectual property or whatever.

711
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,160
If you want A.I. to access your

712
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
website, you have to pay a fee.

713
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,740
Kind of like teams and Skype, right?

714
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,800
It's already like that kind of because if

715
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,180
you place the you really do have to.

716
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,040
And by the way, Google will happily send

717
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,020
you a thing about it.

718
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,060
If you own any sort of entity on

719
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,000
the Internet that, you know, is registered.

720
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,480
Yeah.

721
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,200
They'll send you a thing saying, you know,

722
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,480
your website is not working right because blah,

723
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,020
blah, blah, blah.

724
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,580
And at the end of the day, they

725
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,000
want you to buy stuff is what it

726
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,200
is.

727
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,480
Yeah.

728
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,460
But but here's the thing.

729
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,760
People don't read anyway.

730
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,240
The level of consensus today, I was having

731
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,320
a discussion with a medical person and they're

732
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,260
saying, what about this vitamin in this vegetable?

733
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,580
So let's take a let's take an orange.

734
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,420
You know how they say there's vitamin C

735
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,240
in an orange, really?

736
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,440
OK, what's going on is most people will

737
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,900
agree to that and they think it's just

738
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,020
good science.

739
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,340
But what's not being given is when you

740
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,080
get a scientific answer for something, they always

741
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,020
omit the process.

742
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,820
They exclude what it took to get that

743
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,120
answer.

744
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,800
And once any reasonable, semi-intelligent person is

745
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,300
told how they came to the point where

746
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,340
this exists in a fruit or vegetable or

747
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,660
whatever, you're like, how can it be the

748
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:29,940
same?

749
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Because the way they see vitamin C in

750
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,180
an orange to just get the vitamin C

751
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,920
is they crush the orange center, fuse it,

752
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,880
separate everything, dehydrate it and burn it or

753
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,160
combine it with other chemicals.

754
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,860
Then you give the example, you know, at

755
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,000
a hamburger shop.

756
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,500
You know, no one when they no one

757
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,420
knows what the hell you're talking about when

758
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,860
they said, do you want cucumber with your

759
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,240
hamburger?

760
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:52,800
No.

761
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,300
What?

762
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,840
Never.

763
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,100
No.

764
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,940
But they ask you, do you want pickle?

765
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,820
And most people will say yes or no.

766
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,580
They know because cucumbers don't are not pickles.

767
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,300
Right.

768
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,360
What they are, but they're not.

769
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,280
No, they are.

770
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,840
But after a certain process, they become something

771
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,100
else.

772
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,220
It's changed into something else completely different.

773
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,100
So when you're given an answer about this

774
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,320
or that, like, for example, the fluoride argument

775
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,500
is to get fluoride.

776
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,180
Elemental fluoride is almost impossible.

777
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,380
I don't think it might be a specimen

778
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,020
in some reference museum, but fluoride would most

779
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,620
likely be found as calcium fluoride or sodium

780
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,260
fluoride.

781
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,580
Right.

782
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,680
So calcium fluoride would be like carbon dioxide,

783
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,620
you know, in your soft drink and your

784
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,500
pop soda.

785
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,140
And sodium fluoride would be like carbon monoxide.

786
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,540
Right.

787
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,140
So no one says you want carbon in

788
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,680
your drink, you know, carbonated drink.

789
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,600
You see carbonated.

790
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,780
But is it carbon carbonated drinks?

791
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,560
Are they carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide?

792
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,180
Right.

793
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,880
So it's the same thing with the fluoride

794
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,780
argument is we say fluoride.

795
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,000
First of all, I don't think elemental fluoride

796
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,220
is available anywhere.

797
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,220
Only only the calcium fluoride would be in

798
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,760
small amounts.

799
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,140
But the prevailing quantity is sodium fluoride, which

800
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
is the carbon monoxide version of fluoride.

801
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,300
See.

802
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,860
So, yeah, so the science behind it, simply

803
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,380
saying fluoride, for example, omits the practicality of

804
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,520
it.

805
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:25,760
Right.

806
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,000
Where I would I would be OK with

807
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,700
a supplement or toothpaste with calcium fluoride, but

808
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,600
not sodium fluoride.

809
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,260
Just like I enjoy a cola or a

810
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,200
lemon soda with carbon dioxide, not carbon monoxide.

811
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,640
Right.

812
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,940
Like hydrogen.

813
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,820
Hydrogen is an absolutely necessary element to a

814
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,700
whole lot of things.

815
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,120
Right.

816
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,300
But, you know, do you want to drink

817
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,820
hydrogen peroxide?

818
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,520
No, you don't.

819
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,620
Right.

820
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,220
That would be H2O2 or something.

821
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,560
Yeah.

822
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,960
So that's another.

823
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,260
Yeah.

824
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,900
But then it's not hydrogen.

825
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,280
It's.

826
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
Yeah, it's it's it's not about the hydrogen.

827
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,120
It's about the compound.

828
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,740
Right.

829
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,740
So this thing, you know, about some people

830
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,500
when I have a discussion, I say, oh,

831
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,180
so you're holistic.

832
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,940
Well, is that what's the opposite of holistic?

833
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,880
Fractional.

834
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,380
Right.

835
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:14,900
Right.

836
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
So we could talk about the value.

837
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,780
They're both quantitative.

838
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,660
One is the whole quantity of the one's

839
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,520
partial quantity.

840
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,400
But qualitatively, looking at all of the quantity

841
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,800
is qualitatively better than looking at only some

842
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,100
of it.

843
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,420
Right.

844
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,940
So what I call, you know, the opposite

845
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,240
of, you know, a lot of the alternatives

846
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,220
call holistic medicine.

847
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,520
That was a big thing in the 80s

848
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,040
and 90s.

849
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,660
There's not much talk about that.

850
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,180
Maybe there is.

851
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,520
I don't know.

852
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,240
I don't watch, though, because it's just frustrating.

853
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,220
Any any medical stuff that they put out

854
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,680
early, early, early 2000s, it was still prominent.

855
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,220
Yeah.

856
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,240
And it's sort of faded.

857
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,700
But yeah.

858
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,540
So the accepted medicine is all fractional.

859
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,540
It's not holistic.

860
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,200
I mean, it's not it's only looking at

861
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,920
parts just like, right.

862
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,100
You know, oh, this has got, you know,

863
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,160
oranges of vitamin C.

864
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,460
So let's just give vitamin C in a

865
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,240
packet or supplement.

866
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
It's you can't say it comes from oranges.

867
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,980
You can say it's derived from oranges, just

868
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,880
like a pickle on your hamburgers derived from

869
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,420
a cucumber.

870
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,500
Even in the world of medical technicians, what

871
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,860
do they do?

872
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,140
They fractionally handle things.

873
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,440
They say, OK, you had a problem with

874
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,780
your heart.

875
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,700
Now you need to go to the heart

876
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,620
doctor who is a doctor who just focuses

877
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,980
on that, which means that he doesn't pay

878
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,580
attention to anything else that's going on.

879
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,880
He's just focused on your heart.

880
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,040
And that's kind of yeah.

881
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
Legally, legally, none of them hold water.

882
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,420
In order to be legal, they have to

883
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,740
have a sworn affidavit.

884
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,520
And no doctor will ever do that.

885
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,440
But they get you to consent and agree

886
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,760
to it.

887
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,220
So they always put it on you.

888
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,020
But the whole thing is I brought this

889
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,200
up because it's very important.

890
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,660
Yeah.

891
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,620
To the legal stuff and law stuff.

892
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,480
It's all about swearing or affirming.

893
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,240
You know, in the biblical, it says don't

894
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,680
swear.

895
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,540
Right.

896
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,720
But you can affirm under the penalty of

897
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,880
perjury, let's say, you know, even as a

898
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,180
child, yours, I swear I didn't do it.

899
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,320
Right.

900
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,980
A little child.

901
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,520
So from just like I brought up the

902
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,340
metaphor, the last sonic with the voices minimize,

903
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,220
you know, the computer is mimicking what we

904
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,000
can do for the mind, which is when

905
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
you have the voices or the let's call

906
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,380
them intrusions, you minimize and then hit the

907
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,240
X, you know, on the whatever to close

908
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,440
it.

909
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,520
So you don't try to close it when

910
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,260
it's in full view, minimize it and then

911
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,940
close it.

912
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,360
And that's how you stop the intrusions, whether

913
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,720
it's temporary or long term.

914
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,920
I wouldn't expect more than temporary because we're

915
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,680
swimming in it.

916
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
The same thing happens with with anything else

917
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,860
that you do.

918
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,000
Minimize it and close it.

919
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,560
There's there's a metaphor that can be used.

920
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,860
The basic metaphor is that to carry over

921
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,980
on many, many topics.

922
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,700
And yeah.

923
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,420
But anyway, maybe I got off track on

924
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,560
that.

925
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,560
But the idea of swearing has been instilled

926
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,900
in us as children and in the legal

927
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,080
field due process.

928
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,120
For example, if you're given a ticket going

929
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,980
150 miles an hour over the speeding limit

930
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
in order for it to people are arguing

931
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,080
like I don't need a driver's license or

932
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,620
any of this stuff.

933
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,800
There's no due process in order to be

934
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,740
charged in law or even legally.

935
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,260
The opposing party has to have a sworn

936
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,940
document.

937
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,660
In other words, they're putting their nuts on

938
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,620
the table under the penalty of perjury.

939
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,920
Otherwise, there's no due process.

940
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,740
There's no case.

941
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,420
And no one really pays attention to that.

942
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,280
All they do is is cite, well, I'm

943
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,860
allowed to go 150 miles an hour.

944
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
I have a right to travel or this

945
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,660
and that.

946
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
No, they just it's due.

947
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,960
Or they say the court doesn't have jurisdiction.

948
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,980
Forget about all that.

949
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,280
Do you want to bring something into a

950
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,860
peanut court or a kangaroo court?

951
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,540
Whatever the rules are, you still have to

952
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,380
have a sworn affidavit from the opposition.

953
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,460
Right.

954
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,040
Or rebut with mine.

955
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,480
And no one there's a minimum majority.

956
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,640
And that is the the the real success

957
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,300
of the matter.

958
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
And if they don't address it, there's no

959
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,860
case.

960
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:03,820
Right.

961
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,840
So and this is this is very much

962
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
the idea of swearing or putting your nuts

963
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,900
on the table, as they say, and all

964
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,160
that is the basis for all this stuff.

965
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,840
And how do you do that with evidence?

966
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,720
Right.

967
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,220
And and it's and if you don't have

968
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,940
the evidence, your word is enough.

969
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,340
That's why we said earlier with the Biden

970
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,940
thing, when that was put out that he's

971
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,240
a clone, what did the the Biden being

972
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
the opposition now or however you want to

973
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,040
see it, what was their response?

974
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,940
If there's no response, we have to take

975
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,640
the statement as being truer than no than

976
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,340
no response.

977
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,240
So the more true what makes something true

978
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,040
is how it's affirmed and put forward.

979
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,240
That's why so many people are so misled.

980
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,120
Right.

981
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Like with the Kennedy assassination, with 9-11,

982
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,420
with all that stuff.

983
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,060
Because, you know, when 9-11 happened, they

984
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,940
just put up a picture within 30 seconds

985
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,860
of Osama bin Laden.

986
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
They suspect him.

987
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,260
But if you ask people on the street,

988
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,840
they swore it was Osama bin Laden.

989
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,320
You see.

990
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,000
So they were trying to see what you

991
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,500
swear to.

992
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,980
It's kind of like I lie and you

993
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,480
swear to it.

994
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,540
That's what makes it true.

995
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,080
Right.

996
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,620
That's what magicians do.

997
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,640
They they lie by, you know, cutting a

998
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,160
woman in half and putting her back together.

999
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,380
But because you don't know how that happened,

1000
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,120
you swear that you saw a woman cut

1001
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,140
in half and put back together on stage.

1002
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,600
And that makes it true.

1003
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,320
So this is the world that you live

1004
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,420
in.

1005
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
It's actually what I'm saying.

1006
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,420
This is to simplify everything.

1007
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,440
Just like you can affirm or swear that

1008
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,520
a cucumber in your hamburger is not very

1009
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,620
good, but a pickle is.

1010
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,420
Right.

1011
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,700
And you can say that they're not the

1012
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,040
same.

1013
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,580
You can affirm and swear that a cucumber

1014
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,840
in your hamburger is not, you know, a

1015
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,140
firm or swear that it's not the same

1016
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,640
as a pickle.

1017
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,420
And guess what?

1018
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:49,980
It's not.

1019
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,880
And not everybody.

1020
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
Not everybody likes a tomato, but most people

1021
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,000
will put ketchup.

1022
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,460
And that's not the same either at all.

1023
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:57,840
The same.

1024
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,000
But it is.

1025
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
I once had a McDonald's burger in recent

1026
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
memory, like a year.

1027
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,240
Then they didn't put ketchup on it because

1028
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,980
and it was unedible.

1029
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,140
So it's very important.

1030
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,660
It kind of reminds me of an old

1031
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,580
cartoon in a newspaper where the bears are

1032
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,160
over an animal that has been in for

1033
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,820
a long time.

1034
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,020
And like, I think this one's going to

1035
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,580
need ketchup.

1036
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,300
You know, ketchup makes really poor meat quality

1037
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,620
things more edible.

1038
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,620
It's it's necessary.

1039
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,180
But everything is about your condiments.

1040
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,300
And we'll get into that when we get

1041
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,400
more into the biology.

1042
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,100
That's why they put most of the same

1043
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,200
reason.
