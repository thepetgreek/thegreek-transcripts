1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,120
This is SonicEvent198 and it's Rated Y.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,239
Hey Greek, you know, it's a little later,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,680
I don't know, the season seems to be

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,660
changing on me at the moment, even though

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,580
nobody would tell me the season's changing, but

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,060
something in the general atmosphere out here in

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,620
the Southeast seems to be changing, but would

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,720
that matter to you over there?

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,800
No, it's fine.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,260
See, I eat seasonally and I go with

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,120
temperature and I know what happens in the

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,380
spring.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,460
You get bursts of cold, there's blooms and

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,840
all that sort of things you do to

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,300
adjust for it, just like when it gets

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,800
cold, you do things to adjust, but everything's

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,180
on time.

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,120
The oleander always blooms on the middle of

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,220
the second month, so it's blooming now, everything's

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,820
on time.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
You know, lawful second month, you tell an

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,040
idiot second month, they think it's February, right?

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,020
February, yes.

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,640
Yeah, and when I say idiot, it just

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,160
means ignorant.

27
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,660
You know, these words that I use, moron,

28
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,600
idiot, whatever, affectionately known, because they're illegitimate words.

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,980
They're real words.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,920
They're not slang.

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,120
No, there's a quantifiable, hey listen, there's a

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,460
quantifiable explanation for exactly who it is, is

33
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,660
technically an idiot.

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,400
There is.

35
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,380
Unless you define what is, is, yeah.

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, you got to know what the meaning,

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
anyway, speaking of that, just wanted to let

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
you know that we did get a comment

39
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,960
here, which I found interesting.

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,920
Keep water from light, which is something you've

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
been saying for, I don't know, a decade,

42
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,540
at least with me, and it actually makes

43
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,920
sense, this person says.

44
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,960
Light is programming, and if water has memory,

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,700
keeping it separate from it makes sense.

46
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,660
Now, that's a fascinating thing, because light in

47
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,260
and of itself is an energy transfer, so

48
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,620
it would affect a lot of things that

49
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,300
it transfers energy to, one way or another.

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,240
It's a perturbation in the ether, believe it

51
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,760
or not.

52
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,880
Everything's healthy, that's, I've had someone that wants

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,160
to do, I don't know if she'd talk

54
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,880
about it, but let's just say gravity research,

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,120
right?

56
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,880
When you say gravity research, you know, meaning

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
going the other way, and I'm like, oh

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,259
yeah, we could do that.

59
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,640
I haven't, but I understand what it is.

60
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
It's not, you know, it's not a pull

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,320
force, it's a push, and it's all pressure,

62
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,480
and yeah, we can do that.

63
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,120
But the reason I said the light and

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,800
the water is because I've been running tests

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,820
now for about two years on the Scalarator,

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,700
on what affects water, and you know, various

67
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,660
tests on water, and I found that the

68
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,580
water quality reverts back to closer to how

69
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,240
it was before it ran through the device

70
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,640
when it's subject to light.

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
And I started noticing that, of course, in

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,180
the bathroom, you know, I was shaving and

73
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,420
I got an idea kind of thing.

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,020
Now, we have an east window, a large

75
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,920
window in the bathroom, and it comes in

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,540
in the morning, which is good light, because

77
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,080
you could say it's just light, because it's

78
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,020
not heat and light from the end of

79
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,220
the day.

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,320
The western light is hot, warm, and different

81
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
color, right?

82
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,220
Well, it hasn't had a chance to cumulatively

83
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,680
build up, right?

84
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,520
To accumulate.

85
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,600
So it's very objective.

86
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,240
It's a good, it's a clean light, and

87
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,520
the drains in the shadow of both the

88
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,220
tub and the sink and the toilet develop

89
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,860
a little bit more mineral on the side

90
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,560
where the light hits it, but never on

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
the shadow side.

92
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,740
So it's, right, but it wipes off.

93
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,580
It's nothing like it was before it was

94
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,560
hard water, knows what I'm talking about.

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,200
You know, like the shower doors, there's clear

96
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,560
glass doors and they're totally squeaky clean without

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,220
any work.

98
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,820
And if you've never experienced this in your

99
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,000
own home, typically around the drains, you'll start

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,180
to see in some other places like a

101
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,960
yellowish, almost like a nicotine stain on the

102
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,220
tub.

103
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,460
Sure, sir, but what I'm saying, that was

104
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,140
the, like a pun on basically guy was

105
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,420
shaving or taking a shower and he got

106
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,820
an idea.

107
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,760
It was blatant because after I was doing

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,780
experiments, but then I noticed like a half

109
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,640
moon, a half ring only on the side

110
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,260
that gets the light, the mineral developing, right?

111
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,380
And now you'll get mineral development, not scale

112
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,360
is a difference, a scale.

113
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,860
You need like a chisel or a hammer

114
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,480
to get it off.

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,100
Mineral is just a mineral deposit.

116
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,480
You could wipe off with even mild scrubbing

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
is the worst you're going to have with

118
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,440
the scale orator.

119
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,460
But my point here was that it was

120
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,000
so objective because the side that always remained

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,940
in shadow because the Eastern light's going to

122
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,800
come in only until about 10, 10, 30,

123
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,860
right?

124
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,540
Up until summer.

125
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,060
And then it starts coming in earlier, but,

126
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,460
and it was a perfect half moon mineral

127
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,860
side only where the light hit it.

128
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,040
And then I furthered on light with chilled

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,560
water, you know, keeping the water at 39,

130
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,260
one would light one without radical difference again,

131
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,760
more so than if you didn't bring the

132
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,820
water to 39 back and forth, back and

133
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,080
forth.

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,240
But pretty soon we're going to have access

135
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,920
to more, I shouldn't say the tools that

136
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,120
exist for testing water are totally, wholly inadequate

137
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,920
because it's just chemical analysis.

138
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,620
So we're gonna have to develop quality analysis,

139
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,300
which is going to have to go with

140
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,340
subtle electrical qualities and ability to carry mineral

141
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,640
and deposit it and all that.

142
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,940
And that's what we're going to do only

143
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,280
because there's nothing really written about it.

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Everything is just, you know, when you look

145
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,860
at water tests, it's a strict chemical analysis,

146
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,240
right?

147
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,640
Right.

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
It's all about how much of the, but

149
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,740
I won't have time to focus too much

150
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,260
on that because right now it's about setting

151
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,200
up the lab and doing some more larger

152
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
units, meaning larger pipes and also getting a

153
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,620
crew together that understands it.

154
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,640
And a new website that will be focusing

155
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,520
on the luxury market only, right?

156
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,800
Like a Timex will never be a Rolex.

157
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,620
So if Timex came out with a $30

158
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,880
,000 watch, uh, it, it won't because you

159
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,460
see what I mean?

160
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,060
Because they already are established.

161
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,740
You would be a joke, but eventually if

162
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,600
one day Rolex wanted to come out with

163
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
a $20 watch, people would buy it.

164
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,300
Yeah.

165
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,940
They actually did a little more than that.

166
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,440
But during World War II, you know how

167
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,840
all the companies pitched in on, you know,

168
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,220
the war effort, they did make a serviceman's

169
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,600
watch.

170
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,040
And one of them was called the Aviator,

171
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,500
the one that was for field people.

172
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,260
And it wasn't, it's highly collectible by the

173
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,300
way, because it was a limited run and

174
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,060
it was very cheap.

175
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,540
It was affordable to military people and script,

176
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,820
right?

177
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,080
And they only did that during the war

178
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
kind of, you know, like Harley Davidson, you

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,380
know, made, you know, all this stuff.

180
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
There's a whole history to time pieces and

181
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,120
what they did for the U S military

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,400
because some of these things became inherited, by

183
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
the way, preserves the European military.

184
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,120
But yeah.

185
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
But my point here is, but they did

186
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,060
it in the U S too, just saying,

187
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,640
yeah, we want to establish in the luxury

188
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,880
market first and then go over to the

189
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,660
regular people in quotes, you can't do the

190
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,180
reverse.

191
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,740
Uh, like, you know, Volkswagen, uh, made a

192
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,320
V 12 sedan that actually was on par

193
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,280
with Bentley and Rolls Royce.

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,980
And it got very little or no attention.

195
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,660
You could buy a used one now for

196
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,480
like six grand and it's really a ride

197
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,040
like a Bentley and it's the quality level

198
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,520
of that.

199
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,000
But no one ever thought to put it

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
up against the Bentley or Rolls Royce because

201
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,820
it's a Volkswagen, right?

202
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,480
It's the people's cart after all.

203
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,500
I mean, so the thing is, uh, if

204
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
I had 20 regular people that wanted a

205
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,220
scale, right, I would turn them down.

206
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,620
They would have to be a high net

207
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,980
worth person that has, uh, or individual, whatever

208
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,700
you want to call it.

209
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,960
But one of the people that has connections

210
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,680
like an agents that are in the art

211
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,860
industry, the high end real estate, uh, you

212
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,520
know, the private jet, the high end cars.

213
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
One of those people that never buys a

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,020
car off the lot for themselves.

215
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,080
They actually have, I'll just say this with

216
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,460
the heirs of the original Lamborghini motor company

217
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,780
there, because here's the thing, anyone who looks

218
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,100
at the, uh, the, the device on the

219
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,520
website, even though we don't have the luxury

220
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,360
website is like, wow, what the hell is

221
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,480
it?

222
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,660
It's very impressive looking.

223
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,300
You really don't know what it is or

224
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,840
what it does.

225
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,280
There's quite nothing quite like it.

226
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,020
It's quite the piece, you know, to look

227
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,220
at.

228
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,460
It's like eye candy for people that have

229
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,380
been spending all day looking at water treatment

230
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,700
devices like natural action tech.

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,980
They have a bunch of PVC pipes with

232
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,480
end caps and a sticker on it and

233
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
it's $3,000, right?

234
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,360
And uh, yeah, it's just a, you know,

235
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,440
it's nothing like that.

236
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,120
So anyway, I just wanted to put that

237
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,700
out because the, uh, it's too, this is

238
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
the kind of stuff you do when you're

239
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,620
half my age.

240
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,980
Now, I mean, you could start a business

241
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,460
at 80.

242
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,220
It doesn't matter.

243
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,140
Like, um, you know, the guy Bricklin, the

244
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,880
guy who brought Subaru to the U S

245
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
in the seventies, they told him he'll never

246
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,000
work.

247
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,300
Right.

248
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Yeah.

249
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah.

250
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,740
And he made the sports car that was

251
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,140
safe and they beat him up.

252
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,100
Uh, every, everyone that had a contract with

253
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,059
them, reneged on the, did not perform and

254
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,480
they forced him to build it with prison

255
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
labor in Canada using Bondo.

256
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,059
Anyway, he's wants to do a three wheel

257
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,280
car electric for 30 grand and it looks

258
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,700
like a Lambo or a Ferrari and he

259
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,760
still can't get it going.

260
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,460
And he's 80.

261
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,160
He just started with 82 and I started

262
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,820
the company at 80, the new company.

263
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,280
But anyway, we'll cut, you got any questions

264
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,680
or anything?

265
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

266
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,780
I got a few things.

267
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,640
Uh, but just real quickly on the cars

268
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
thing, what was that other super safe car

269
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,400
that was around?

270
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,060
Everybody touted it for its safety.

271
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,020
Uh, That was back in the fifties.

272
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,000
The one you taught Tucker.

273
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,560
Well, there was that one, but there was

274
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,220
one that was more recent, like, and it

275
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,020
was very popular in the eighties and it

276
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,040
was like the indestructible kind of car when

277
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,240
people were worried about it.

278
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,300
Of course, it's gotta be the Yugo, right?

279
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,120
No, not the Yugo.

280
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,740
I know.

281
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,080
I know.

282
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,100
Yugo is funny though, because Yugo is the

283
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,380
Yugoslavian car and now the country doesn't exist.

284
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,440
Yeah.

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,580
Yeah.

286
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,260
It's just horrible.

287
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,200
But yeah, worse than AMC Pacer.

288
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,640
But no, I'm not sure.

289
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,440
The safety Volvo was always Volvo.

290
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,060
That's it.

291
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,300
Yes.

292
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,860
The Volvo.

293
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,340
And that thing faced a similar kind of

294
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,940
weird thing where it popped up in trends.

295
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,280
And then has anybody even seen Volvo in

296
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,600
a while?

297
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,900
I mean, are they, They saw the company

298
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,740
went under because it got, uh, looking for

299
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,400
funding, just like Saab.

300
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,340
I really liked Saabs.

301
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,380
I think they were good.

302
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,220
Well, you have a Saab story.

303
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,980
Oh yeah.

304
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,680
They're excellent cars for driving.

305
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
Speaking of shifting culture, actually, somebody sent in

306
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,100
a pseudo question comment, which I'm going to

307
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,720
condense here, because they want to hear your

308
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,560
ideas about something here, considering where you were

309
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:03,840
born.

310
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,120
In other words, you have a poor view

311
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,460
of culture and how it's pretty much, you

312
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,100
know, nothing and everything is kind of junk.

313
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,340
And what it boils down to is perhaps

314
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,680
that's because you were born in America where

315
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,300
there isn't a cultural history.

316
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,120
There isn't a, what's the word they use

317
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,720
a lineage.

318
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,000
And if perhaps you were born in an

319
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,760
ancient place that had a longer timeline and

320
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,900
ancient culture behind it, uh, and if you

321
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,040
spent time there and not the majority of

322
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,300
your time here in the West or America,

323
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,420
whatever you want to call it, you would

324
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,000
have a completely different view of the world.

325
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,120
Is it possible that you're simply that, let

326
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,800
me give an analogy, analogous answer to that.

327
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,080
You heard me say like people with a

328
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,020
New York accent, you sound dumb no matter,

329
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,560
no matter how smart you are.

330
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,660
Yeah.

331
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm going to sound like Boston, but no

332
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,380
matter how smart you are, if you talk

333
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,080
like turdy turd and turd and you look

334
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
for you from New York or you sound

335
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
dumb, or if you sound like Archie Bunker,

336
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,260
you automatically, it's like, oh, okay, you're, you're,

337
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,160
you're what your chordal cue to cue is.

338
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,620
So I was always curious about that.

339
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,200
But then I found, uh, that a lot

340
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
of them were not smart.

341
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,020
And I said, you know, it's probably because

342
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,300
they sound dumb and they are dumb.

343
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,420
Let me get out of New York.

344
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,520
This is a young age now, early teens.

345
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,580
Let me get out of New York.

346
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:15,820
Right.

347
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,300
Let me go out.

348
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,440
Let me get out of New York.

349
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,680
So up and down the East coast.

350
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,600
I met, and here's the thing in New

351
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,780
York, you're going to meet a lot of,

352
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,860
uh, internationals.

353
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,460
I call them Euro trash, but anyway, internationals.

354
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,560
And um, uh, then I went to the

355
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,080
West coast.

356
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,340
I met a lot of internationals.

357
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,980
I went to Europe.

358
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,840
I said, oh no, it's not a New

359
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,340
York problem.

360
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,520
It's a human problem.

361
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,380
People are generally dumb no matter where you're

362
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,700
from.

363
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,920
Now the thing I noticed about most parts

364
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
of Europe, if not even if you go

365
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
to like Rome, you know, you still have

366
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,020
to pay for water.

367
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,280
You have to, there's a coin for taking

368
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,040
a shower, right?

369
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,940
They meter everything.

370
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,640
Not still, but yeah, yeah.

371
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,440
You could find, if the hotel hasn't been

372
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,020
remodeled since the nineties, if you go to

373
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,780
Rome, to a hotel, they ask you for

374
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,640
a coin, you know, like the vibrating bed

375
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,380
kind of coin, but everything, everything had coins

376
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,320
or what they call tokens in a lot

377
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:05,820
of places.

378
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,140
Yeah.

379
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,140
You could pick them up from the desk.

380
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,800
Very primitive.

381
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,260
Yeah.

382
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,460
Yeah.

383
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,680
Okay.

384
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,460
Like if you go to Athens or whatever,

385
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,460
it's like downtown Brooklyn is a hundred times

386
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,060
more interesting.

387
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,120
You know, the Parthenon is always falling apart.

388
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,220
There's not, the ruins are not worth it.

389
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,540
If you really want to see the Greek

390
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,160
ruins, you go to the museum of London.

391
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,540
Sorry.

392
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,480
You know about that.

393
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,140
The statues and all that were taken.

394
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,120
They took everything.

395
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,700
Yeah.

396
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,000
So the Elgin marbles and all that.

397
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,840
So, and if you really want to see

398
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,540
Egyptian stuff, you go to the Metropolitan Museum.

399
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,540
They're so flaunting there that they actually erected

400
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,280
some of the Cleopatra's needles in Central Park.

401
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,680
The actual ones they took out of Egypt,

402
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,660
they're in Central Park with the acid rain.

403
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,960
So it very, very, very primitive.

404
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
I found, I think the whole thing is

405
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,420
the consciousness element.

406
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,780
Like for example, I spent most of the

407
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,140
day working on the cars we have because

408
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,620
the, the quality of the, the service of

409
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,920
mechanics has gone down so low, something like

410
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,700
building an automatic transmission.

411
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,620
I don't want to do, but engine mounts

412
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,680
and valve covers and valve jobs and all

413
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:09,820
that.

414
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
I'll do most of it because you bring

415
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,700
it to someone.

416
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:11,900
Yeah.

417
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,520
So what they, it's $150 an hour.

418
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:14,780
Yeah.

419
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,560
You'll get a bill, you know, you know,

420
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,880
you buy the engine, not put it in

421
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,080
an hour and the engine mounts 40 bucks

422
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,800
and you know, you're going to, they're going

423
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,460
to charge you 400 for that.

424
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,840
Right.

425
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,320
You know?

426
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,580
All right.

427
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,080
So what?

428
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,380
Okay.

429
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,800
But when you get it, you come back,

430
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,720
there's a bolt missing.

431
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,040
They didn't connect this, this or that, whatever.

432
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,180
It's like, what the hell?

433
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,360
You know, this is real basic stuff.

434
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,280
The same thing in 2019 when we would

435
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,420
go out to eat, we had some really

436
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,280
good meals and I would tell the wife

437
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,900
and say, you better enjoy this because you

438
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,920
know, in a few years you won't be

439
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,400
able to go out.

440
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,220
The food will be terrible.

441
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,100
Even the same place.

442
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,260
And I'm right.

443
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,520
Yeah.

444
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,860
Okay.

445
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,740
But here's the thing.

446
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,820
Everything's going down.

447
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,160
Okay.

448
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,580
But, but, but let me, let me just

449
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,840
stop you because I'm hearing all this stuff

450
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,860
about over here in this part of the

451
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,860
world and literally you're being in places where

452
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,760
you're steeped in a culture that could have

453
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,020
only possibly existed a couple hundred years.

454
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,920
Yeah.

455
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,920
Unless I'm like, I have to be gradually

456
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,620
impressed.

457
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm not like a, what is it called?

458
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,500
A nitpicker or whatever.

459
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,100
I just have a certain standard and like

460
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,920
I, like I, okay.

461
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,820
Same thing with people.

462
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,640
When you meet someone, make a judgment call

463
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,300
in the first minute and uh, and just

464
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,100
set it aside as a reference and see

465
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,960
if the person moves away from that judgment

466
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,060
call or is really that because if you

467
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,580
get to know the person after a month

468
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,260
and the, your initial 32nd judgment call still

469
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,920
holds true.

470
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
Now what you're doing is you're fine tuning

471
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,500
your, your skills, right?

472
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:33,860
Right.

473
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,720
Don't abandon, don't abandon what you write.

474
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,120
So practice these things.

475
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,980
So what I use is basically references is,

476
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,360
is how people view the place they live,

477
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,280
right?

478
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,940
And from at one point I would say

479
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,120
Americans are pretty high up on the list.

480
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,020
Like for example, uh, on that end, uh,

481
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,080
for example, uh, you know, there's a, if

482
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
you even look now, documentaries on most of

483
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,760
the cities and urban areas in India, you

484
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,900
see litter everywhere.

485
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
And that started when they were protesting the

486
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,040
government in the fifties, they did it by

487
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,900
throwing the garbage out of their windows on

488
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,880
the street and, and, and not having it

489
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,400
picked up.

490
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,400
And it's somehow they did, they protested for

491
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,940
so long, it became part of the landscape.

492
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,060
It was a cultural thing.

493
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,980
Just like in Spain, they don't say, they

494
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,700
say, they speak with a list because King

495
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,260
Philip had a list and to normalize him,

496
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,220
everyone started speaking with a list, right?

497
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,280
A list.

498
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,620
So there's the normalization part, there's your own

499
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,720
personal references.

500
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,540
Uh, I, I like to make personal references

501
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,760
as objective as possible that have to do

502
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
with what's called, uh, you know, health and

503
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,640
fitness, wellbeing, both mental and non-mental.

504
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,680
But here, here's the thing.

505
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,560
This is one of the things I wanted

506
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,720
to get into and not maybe too much

507
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,880
is if you go to a place where

508
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,020
everyone is insane, uh, it doesn't really prove

509
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,040
that well to call one of them insane

510
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,640
because they're all insane and they won't know

511
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,940
what you're talking about.

512
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,540
Right?

513
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,300
So in order to have that, let's say

514
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,040
a malady or an illness, it has to

515
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,780
be narrowed out from the collective group.

516
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,680
So this is very specific because right now

517
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,340
the quick references that I use, I find

518
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,160
that pretty much everyone I run into without

519
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,640
any, very few exceptions or have a slight

520
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,080
insanity, like not, they're not well, right?

521
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,080
Uh, and you can't call them out on

522
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,600
it because everyone else is in the same

523
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:31,860
boat.

524
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,480
So what do you do?

525
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,760
Right?

526
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,420
Do you keep, you keep it to yourself

527
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,260
and you start building reference points and that's

528
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,340
why you're like, oh yeah, I could be

529
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,820
in solitary confinement just fine.

530
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,100
But anyway, when you go to somebody's house

531
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,680
and you walk in the door and the

532
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,780
place stinks, the people that live there and

533
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,080
the people that are constantly there don't even

534
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,060
smell it anymore.

535
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,260
It's the same thing.

536
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,480
It's like, what do you mean it stinks?

537
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,640
You can't smell it anymore.

538
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,420
Everyone's house stinks.

539
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,220
And if everyone's house stinks.

540
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
Here's the thing, if you go to most

541
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,500
Mexican households, it smells like fabuloso.

542
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,080
Every one of them pretty much.

543
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,280
Right?

544
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,360
And they think it smells good.

545
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,760
Okay.

546
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,980
And it goes beyond that.

547
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,740
Uh, you know, I'm, I'm seeing things that

548
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,280
I really never wanted to see, uh, as

549
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,160
a collective and it goes down to the

550
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,300
individual and it really makes me feel like

551
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,400
this is a hundred, uh, you know, a

552
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,460
hundred percent, uh, wrong, um, anybody from India

553
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,980
or Pakistan or from any of the surrounding

554
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,580
areas, uh, you know, geographically there, if they

555
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,940
came from there for about 30 years, if

556
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,840
I stepped into their house, all their houses

557
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,560
smelled the same and it all smelled right.

558
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,300
But, but it's, it goes beyond that.

559
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,460
It's a communication culture.

560
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,940
Um, you know, what they view as being

561
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,160
wellbeing, you know, there's a, well, there's a

562
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,500
way of, uh, there's a wellness or wellbeing

563
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,700
this, if you could say that, that all

564
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,180
humans can share and it has to do

565
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,240
with good hygiene, cleanliness to a degree and,

566
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,900
um, and, uh, a good diet, you know,

567
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
based on the seasons and that's what I

568
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,880
was going to point out is they all

569
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
had common foods.

570
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
They all had common, uh, toiletries and toiletries

571
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,720
they use.

572
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,860
They all use similar cleaning products and it

573
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,300
just seemed to be a shared sort of

574
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,880
a action where obviously, but here's the thing.

575
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,820
In that case, the Americans rule are the

576
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,440
low, the one of the worst when it

577
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,060
comes to food and a bunch of other

578
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,460
stuff.

579
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,460
Uh, so it, it varies so much that

580
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,840
I can't really say, but there is something

581
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,420
that genetic memory may be, uh, for example,

582
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,620
when I was out at the mines, they

583
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,520
were setting up a 48 inch sand screw.

584
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,200
Now, 48 inches sounds pretty small.

585
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
No, it was about 50 feet long and

586
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,780
it's 48 inches in diameter.

587
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
It's like an Archimedes spiral and it goes

588
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,420
against gravity and water flows one way and

589
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,660
the gold goes up the other way.

590
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,340
The heavies, right?

591
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay.

592
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,660
And they, they set it up and they

593
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,360
couldn't get it level.

594
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,800
So I went, there's my first day on

595
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,160
the mind and I started directing how the

596
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,260
steel should be cut and welded.

597
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,720
And the old timers were very upset because

598
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,760
who's this guy, right?

599
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,400
Especially, you know, with a New York accent,

600
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
let's say, you know, he's a Yankee.

601
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,800
Well, I don't sound like an Arizona, right?

602
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,500
Or Nevada or whatever, or a Texan or

603
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,080
an Okie or a Colorado, you know, you

604
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,680
have, you have more of a bland East

605
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,460
coast accent.

606
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,500
It's not really specific to New York, but

607
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,700
yeah, sort of a Yankee, but they're very

608
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:07,940
upset.

609
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,100
So the boss of the operation shows up

610
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,340
and he says, listen to what the Greek

611
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,620
says, because when his ancestors were building the

612
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,960
Parthenon, your ancestors were living in caves.

613
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,340
So and I was like, Ooh, okay, well

614
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,700
thanks.

615
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,640
But I, that's not, that's going to piss

616
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,520
them off even more.

617
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,560
But they chilled out.

618
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,820
But that actually, that actually, this is the

619
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,920
level of truthfulness to that.

620
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,400
But the thing is when I heard, you

621
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,700
know, maybe because of the culture or whatever,

622
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,380
but anyway, I have no direct answer.

623
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,420
What's the other question?

624
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,420
Okay.

625
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,920
Well, there's a couple of things.

626
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,860
Anyway, let's see.

627
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,500
We went through that.

628
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, okay.

629
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,720
Here's another one.

630
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,160
The Greeks, I would like to hear the

631
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,980
Greeks thoughts on Ayahuasca.

632
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,400
And then they go into a whole thing.

633
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,240
I don't know if you want this description

634
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,820
about their experience.

635
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,220
No, no, I've had, I've heard, I have

636
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,940
never done it.

637
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,360
I don't feel like I have a need

638
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,920
for it.

639
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,360
The, I would do, what's the other one

640
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,440
that's popular where you start seeing the matrix

641
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,740
now?

642
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,320
The, well, there's, there's psilocybin, there's psilocybin, which

643
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,020
is natural, there's DMT.

644
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,680
DMT.

645
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,480
I would do the DMT before I did

646
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,780
the Ayahuasca, the synthetic one, believe it or

647
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,120
not, in some cases, synthetics are actually better

648
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,620
to do than natural hallucinations because I've done

649
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,100
the LSD verse and the, not the Ayahuasca,

650
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,900
but the mushrooms.

651
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,240
And actually I would prefer the speed, the

652
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,740
speed high from the synthetic.

653
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,780
See that's weird.

654
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,600
I have exactly the natural, exactly the opposite

655
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,380
experience.

656
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,000
I either got nothing or a very bad

657
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
time out of the, uh, uh, the synthetic

658
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,960
and the psilocybin to me was extremely, uh,

659
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,340
helpful, therapeutic.

660
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,940
I, it allowed me to do things psychologically,

661
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,720
emotionally, and even physically, and it never leaves

662
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:52,900
you.

663
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
In other words, you, you could think about

664
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,160
it and he puts you right back in

665
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,820
that state, right?

666
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,900
When you remember what you got from it,

667
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,780
you are literally, you have a permanent alteration

668
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,740
with the psilocybin.

669
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,520
Uh, I've gotten, okay, I've gotten people from

670
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,500
all walks of life.

671
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,340
It was very popular about a decade ago

672
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,320
for people to make pilgrimages, like, you know,

673
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,000
the yuppie type, you know, the guy, you

674
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,840
know, he's taking a month off from working

675
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,500
on wall street.

676
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,020
He's going to spend a 5,000 bucks,

677
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,020
find a shaman down and wherever, and, uh,

678
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,720
do some ayahuasca and they're going to guide

679
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,240
him and all that.

680
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,500
Right.

681
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,640
And they're going to put them in a

682
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,200
teepee or a tent for, uh, they all

683
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
had very different reactions.

684
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,040
So one can't say, uh, it does this

685
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,900
or it does that.

686
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,620
Most of them were negative, meaning, uh, in

687
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,100
terms of the way they felt through the

688
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,220
whole thing, uh, in terms of terror and

689
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,380
feeling like they're going to die.

690
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,820
So with that said, why don't, why don't

691
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,880
we give his experience?

692
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,480
Do it.

693
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Instead of just dismissing it, how, what's paraphrase

694
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,680
like what this person's experience was like.

695
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,420
Yeah, I'll do that.

696
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,220
But just a quick commentary here.

697
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
You know what, to me, all of this

698
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,860
stuff is legitimate medicine and why?

699
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Because it does have a, there is no

700
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
one size fits all anything about it, which

701
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,500
is the way medicine truly works.

702
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,900
There are general guidelines here, but the truth

703
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,440
is some things will be more effective for

704
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,580
you or less effective for you than they

705
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,200
are for me, et cetera.

706
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
And it's based on the fact that we

707
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,420
are all constructed just slightly differently.

708
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,740
There are rules that apply, but when it

709
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,280
comes to true medicine, there isn't a standardized

710
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,860
everybody.

711
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,580
There is.

712
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,580
And that's why I believe in medical racism,

713
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,220
whether it's synthetic stuff or natural stuff, people

714
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,900
are, we're very different.

715
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,940
And we've talked about it from a medical

716
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,060
standpoint, ask any anesthesiologist, if he doesn't practice

717
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,780
medical racism, you'll have a lot of dead

718
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,720
black people or melanated people.

719
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,100
Right.

720
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
And, and the whole thing with Asians and

721
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,880
there's a, you know, different tropics, they'll kill,

722
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,260
you know?

723
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,060
Yeah.

724
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
So anyway.

725
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,560
Okay.

726
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,820
So give us a little bit of a

727
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,480
paraphrase on this person's right.

728
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll read part of it.

729
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,020
Let's see.

730
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,720
Okay.

731
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,520
Let's see when.

732
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay.

733
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,380
I was good.

734
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,220
Okay.

735
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,460
So his experience goes like this, you know,

736
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,900
and he talks about how some people talk

737
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,320
about, you know, being able to actually speak

738
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,420
with the gods and all that.

739
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,180
Okay.

740
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,820
He says, I can easily buy into that

741
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,220
concept because I had an experience where I

742
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,780
visually experienced visualizing the hierarchies of various individuals

743
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,160
that seem to play influential roles.

744
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,680
Now they had human form and, but they

745
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,520
look, you know, different because of the experience

746
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:28,940
itself.

747
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,560
They were amazing, beautiful, all that.

748
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,200
And he doesn't quite know how to describe

749
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,560
it.

750
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,200
And there was not much going on because

751
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
I felt too dumb to communicate with them.

752
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,400
So I just sat and observed mostly.

753
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,260
Do you think substances like ayahuasca, another sub

754
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,200
questionnaire, do you think substances like ayahuasca and

755
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
psilocybin mushrooms give us direct access to the

756
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,080
realm of the gods?

757
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,040
Indirect access because direct access would be on

758
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,920
command, right?

759
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,300
And it would be a lot cleaner.

760
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,760
And how, how careful should we be about

761
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
these experiences?

762
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,220
You know, how seriously should we take them

763
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,120
or is it just kind of another, you

764
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,220
know, form of entertainment?

765
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,680
I think it's personal.

766
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Like, you know, ask someone like Ken Kesey,

767
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,500
Timothy Leary that, you know, and you have

768
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,240
a different answer.

769
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,220
But I don't even know if people know

770
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,300
who Ken Kesey is at Magic Bus Days.

771
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,060
I used to hang out with Michael Graden

772
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,720
who did the trip with him, but he

773
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,460
went by the name of Moses.

774
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,800
And I said, why Moses?

775
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,180
He says, guys, Moses was known for guiding

776
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,640
people.

777
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,340
That's what I do.

778
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,680
And it was a trip when I was

779
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,160
hanging out with, with for a week or

780
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
so with Larry, Larry Fishburne.

781
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,980
He's always looking at people in situations and

782
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,940
he says, I want to do a short

783
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,120
movie with Moses and Mike Graden and I

784
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,100
want to have Mickey Rourke cast as him.

785
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,940
And I was like, OK, to give people

786
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,400
an idea.

787
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,700
But the variations of how it should be

788
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,160
used and how often depends on the culture,

789
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,400
believe it or not, and personal preference.

790
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,640
I would suggest and I don't get much

791
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,140
into, you know, after death, what happens.

792
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,480
But if there is any consciousness after you

793
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,500
die, you're going to feel like you're high

794
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,900
and doped out seriously.

795
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,960
It's not going to be anything like a

796
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,680
sober body.

797
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,420
And I would almost want to say when

798
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,660
I told you so later on.

799
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,400
But yeah, when you die and you have

800
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,540
any consciousness, it's like you're high and doped

801
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:27,800
up.

802
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,760
So if you get high and doped up

803
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,040
now and some serious hallucinogenics, I can almost

804
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,880
say speculatively that's what it's like if you

805
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,340
have consciousness after death.

806
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,540
So to live it up is another way

807
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,360
to think of it.

808
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,180
Another thing, though, just to say here is

809
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,240
I object to the idea of describing the

810
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,040
psilocybin experience as high.

811
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,620
It was not like a high.

812
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,000
It wasn't like smoking weed.

813
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,400
It's almost like, you know, when you're in

814
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,560
movies, they have these multiplexes.

815
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,920
You could walk out of one movie and

816
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,600
go into another.

817
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,080
Yeah.

818
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,860
OK.

819
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,740
It's more like that.

820
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,420
Yeah, it's definitely like that.

821
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,060
And then you're immersed in, you know, like

822
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,660
when you actually get lost in a movie,

823
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,140
in that experience and you're kind of, you

824
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,300
know, sort of suspended.

825
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,660
But here's the thing with the psilocybin, LSD

826
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:20,860
also, I heard before I first did it,

827
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,140
advice, make sure you're around a good crowd.

828
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,140
Don't be in the city.

829
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,100
You know, it's advice because if someone gives

830
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,800
you a bad head, you know, a bad

831
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,840
vibe, it lasts for the whole time.

832
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,200
It's really hard to get out of it.

833
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,500
And fortunately, that's never happened to me.

834
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,020
But I've seen how people did not have

835
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,140
a good quote unquote trip.

836
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah.

837
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,840
And then people tell you, be around people

838
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,860
you trust because, you know, some people just

839
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,680
decide to be, you know, tricksters of sorts

840
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
and, you know, mess with you and, you

841
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,760
know, because they they use themselves.

842
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,100
But psilocybin was just a generally really good

843
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,060
emotional well-being feeling.

844
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,680
Yeah.

845
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:50,940
Right.

846
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,880
But but they did.

847
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,000
There was a whole other stuff.

848
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,340
Housewives were popping in the 60s.

849
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,940
What was it?

850
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,780
A whole bunch of stuff.

851
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,320
Oh, yeah.

852
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,680
Right.

853
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,680
And yeah, they had a bunch of different

854
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,120
things to make him feel good.

855
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
And that's why when you say, hey, dear,

856
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,240
you know, you watch a movie from the

857
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,800
50s, hey, dear, she's so.

858
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,720
I said, I bet she's she's high on

859
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,820
something right now.

860
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,360
Well, there were a lot of 70s that

861
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,580
the actress actually, you know, would be high

862
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,340
as well as.

863
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,820
Well, there were a lot of there were

864
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,020
a lot of what they would call mama's

865
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,780
little helpers right out there.

866
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,180
There you go.

867
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,660
Yeah.

868
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,200
All right.

869
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,740
What else you got?

870
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,120
OK.

871
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,280
Please ask the Greek how we can further

872
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,080
heal old scars on the skin that seem

873
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,740
sensitive after years.

874
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,280
Also with tattoo removal to help with the

875
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,940
skin heal.

876
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,660
Can I compress the skin and wrap it

877
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,140
tight right after a laser treatment?

878
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,420
Yeah, absolutely.

879
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,540
Vacuum wouldn't be lost as much than if

880
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,480
you had a cut on the skin.

881
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,540
But what will happen is the actual burn,

882
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,000
let's say, from the laser treatment will be

883
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,040
your body will interpret it as an injury

884
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,440
and start sending the emergency services there to

885
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,120
swell it.

886
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,880
And right.

887
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,660
So you don't have to wrap it as

888
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,200
tight because it's not an inclusion on the

889
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,480
skin.

890
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,340
It's not anything cut or open like you

891
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,980
would want to seal a tire that has

892
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,540
a cut in it.

893
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:08,740
Right.

894
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,880
Literally think of it as a pressure differential.

895
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
You wouldn't have to have that much.

896
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,220
I would do blue light if and blue

897
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,420
lights.

898
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:17,920
Very simple.

899
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,900
Go get some blue glass at a thrift

900
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,300
store, stick a light bulb in it and

901
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,900
give yourself an hour of that.

902
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,200
You know, like, for example, when didn't didn't

903
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,020
show God, he is the name chroma therapy

904
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,560
or chroma light therapy thing with the blue

905
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,000
lights and all the different colored lights for

906
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,700
different things.

907
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,560
Yeah, that works like you get a sunburn,

908
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,160
you know, you're going to get a sunburn.

909
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,700
So when you come inside, you know, it's

910
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,880
always worst at night.

911
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,660
You know, if you got some you come

912
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,560
in at night, you're going to sleep anyway.

913
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
Put a blue light, which is at least

914
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
a hundred watt light bulb.

915
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,600
Now we just have LEDs, very bright light

916
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
bulb inside, like a blue mason jar or

917
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,720
something.

918
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,860
We'll get that blue film and sleep with

919
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,020
that on and you'll wake up and there'll

920
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,700
be no sunburn.

921
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,820
It does work.

922
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,220
Really?

923
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,560
Because, you know, I get that if I

924
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,100
get a bad sunburn, I get that physical

925
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,680
feeling almost as if my skin is smoldering.

926
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,360
You know what I mean?

927
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,560
It's a tingling and it's a pain.

928
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,500
It's painful, actually.

929
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,800
And if you take a warm shower, it

930
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,380
feels like you're being scalded.

931
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,740
But the blue light does work.

932
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,440
I mean, I've had I've had doctors look

933
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
at it and call it, you know, sun

934
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,060
poisoning many times when I've had, you know,

935
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,200
a lot of damage.

936
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,760
You could justify that several ways.

937
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
You got to get melanated, dude.

938
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,900
You need anyway.

939
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,660
No, I have a little bit of that.

940
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,300
So yeah, but no, I would say don't

941
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,900
treat it like an open wound, but definitely

942
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,440
not doesn't have to be that tight.

943
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
I would say firm.

944
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,200
You could even do cold water, not ice,

945
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,440
unless you have an ice pack with a

946
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,780
barrier, like, you know, a couple of layers

947
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,980
of cotton or something to keep it from

948
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,180
freezing.

949
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,240
But the blue light would definitely be a

950
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,740
big help.

951
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,640
And yeah, and I don't have much experience

952
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,940
with that because tattoo removal is a laser

953
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,740
treatment and lasers are really funky.

954
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,920
A bunch of people I've been in touch

955
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,500
with actually one is really big on the

956
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,220
laser thing.

957
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,200
And but they don't understand the vacuum and

958
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,280
all the other stuff.

959
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,020
So it'd be interesting to give people that

960
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,340
are practitioners a real understanding of how the

961
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,160
human body works and then go reapply what

962
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,660
they think is a cure all for a

963
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,120
lot of things.

964
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,540
But anyway, anything else?

965
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,460
Not really.

966
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,900
There was there's a question in progress the

967
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,840
next time we get together.

968
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,140
It's about colors.

969
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,960
And I'm going to wait until he responds

970
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,420
to me because I asked him to clarify

971
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,900
to make more sense of it.

972
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,260
But also somebody, you know, was there was

973
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,660
a couple of comments that standing out this

974
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,320
week about, you know, everything is a waste

975
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,820
of time.

976
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,040
And I say that, yeah, a great T

977
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,140
-shirt could come out of that, except instead

978
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,360
of quoting the Greek on it.

979
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,480
What you do is you give people the

980
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,200
idea that since they're the ones reading it,

981
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,820
you and everything around you is a waste

982
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,380
of time.

983
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,200
Make that like a thought of the day

984
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,980
T-shirt and just print that on both

985
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,220
sides and big, big white text on a

986
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,820
black background.

987
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
And boom.

988
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,280
I wonder, though, the market that would actually

989
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,540
buy that T-shirt, would they think it's

990
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,820
so much of a waste of time that

991
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,260
they wouldn't bother buying the T-shirt and

992
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,500
it wouldn't work as a product?

993
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,600
Yeah, that's right.

994
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,440
It's self-defeating.

995
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,760
I would think of it.

996
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah.

997
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,380
The wordage is very important, like brainwashing and

998
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
washing your brain.

999
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,720
Right.

1000
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,300
Very different syntax.

1001
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Well, you should say syntax, but very different

1002
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,960
impression.

1003
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,920
Like I was very sad to see the

1004
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,380
people that came up and actually started using

1005
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,280
the moniker mental floss because I thought that

1006
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,180
was a great concept.

1007
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,500
Mental floss.

1008
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,660
That's actually you cleaning out the little bits

1009
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,740
of crap that are stuck around your mind.

1010
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,440
You know what I mean?

1011
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,720
Yeah.

1012
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,180
The stuff that you chewed and never really

1013
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,560
got to where it was supposed to go.

1014
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,420
It just hangs around.

1015
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,860
But I would say that there's probably a

1016
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,720
better way to say it.

1017
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,740
I've been thinking that everything is about wasting

1018
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,100
your time for a very long time.

1019
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,160
I just didn't know how to say it.

1020
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,640
So I said, just call it how you

1021
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,140
see it.

1022
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,360
Yeah.

1023
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,920
It is.

1024
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,540
What is it?

1025
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,100
Occam's razor, the simplest solution is often the

1026
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,720
correct one.

1027
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,720
There you go.

1028
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,720
I mean, I paraphrase.

1029
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,820
Some people resist that.

1030
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
They say, it's not a waste of time.

1031
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,720
I have memory.

1032
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm like, oh my gosh, triggered.

1033
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,440
Occam's razor.

1034
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,240
In real life.

1035
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,880
So look, I know you had a couple

1036
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,460
of ideas, etc.

1037
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,120
But anything, this will be our final get

1038
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,980
together on the the platform they call Skype.

1039
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,920
So I do need to ask you, and

1040
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,060
somebody did ask it because I guess they

1041
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,980
missed the last couple.

1042
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,260
Are you going to continue the financial discussion

1043
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,620
you were having as a group discussion on

1044
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,460
teams or.

1045
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,460
Yeah.

1046
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,200
I'm taking.

1047
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,680
Here's I'll do a public thing.

1048
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,220
If I'm not going around that much.

1049
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,620
I'm not.

1050
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,640
I wanted to get a bunch of people.

1051
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,820
This is not for anyone.

1052
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,420
Whatever.

1053
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,480
Don't take it personally.

1054
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,760
But I need.

1055
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,460
I don't know.

1056
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,040
It just didn't it didn't work out for

1057
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,160
me.

1058
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Let's just say it that way.

1059
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,180
So I haven't been revisiting it or anything.

1060
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,640
It's still.

1061
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,280
OK.

1062
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,200
Yeah.

1063
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,320
It just didn't work out.

1064
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,920
But that's fine.

1065
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,180
I mean, I have no expectations.

1066
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,860
And but no, but I am still continuing

1067
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,780
the financial work with another group, believe it

1068
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,160
or not.

1069
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,380
And we'll see how that goes.

1070
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,640
I have no expectations there either.

1071
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,820
The reason I did it is like from

1072
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,780
the old parlance that you hear and what

1073
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,620
they call Buddhism and the old philosophy, philosophical

1074
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:27,980
reasons.

1075
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,180
If you do something for selfish reasons, but

1076
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,900
it's still good.

1077
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,460
It's still a good thing.

1078
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:32,680
Right.

1079
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
Because if you didn't do it, no good

1080
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,380
would have come out of it.

1081
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm doing the financial thing strictly for selfish

1082
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,120
reasons, because I want to stay with the

1083
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,480
inventing and the creative stuff.

1084
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,700
I have so much to do that I

1085
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,820
do not want to spend time on the

1086
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,580
financial end.

1087
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,160
So I figured if I can get some

1088
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,180
people up to speed with it, they will

1089
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,780
benefit clearly in their personal lives.

1090
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,080
And I could work with them and they

1091
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,480
would also handle my stuff.

1092
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,620
So I don't have to spend time with

1093
00:33:59,620 --> 00:33:59,780
it.

1094
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,460
So they get the benefit of knowing how

1095
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,840
to do it and they can take it

1096
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,740
off your hands.

1097
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,560
And there you go.

1098
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,440
So, you know, yeah.

1099
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
And then I could start a trust and

1100
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
then they could be a trustee of my

1101
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,840
trust and I would reciprocate trustee of their

1102
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,300
trust.

1103
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,440
And to have an organization, all that now,

1104
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,679
I'm not condemning anyone or anything, but right

1105
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,960
now, as it is for me, it's on

1106
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,320
hold.

1107
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,320
And give an example like today at 10

1108
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,940
a.m., I was contacted out of the

1109
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,040
blue the other day from someone that I've

1110
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,080
known for 15 years, haven't met their they

1111
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,620
do real estate and all this other stuff.

1112
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,100
And this is, hey, I'd like you to

1113
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,840
bring you into a conference that we have

1114
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
every Saturday morning.

1115
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,719
And these guys are into the financial system

1116
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,739
and they are and they're actually working in

1117
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:37,880
it.

1118
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,480
But they don't know much and they were

1119
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,100
quite impressed with what I brought.

1120
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,900
And I was not so impressed, but it's

1121
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,820
very workable.

1122
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,179
My big thing with people is communication.

1123
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,699
I think everyone needs to work on their

1124
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,420
communication skills, including myself.

1125
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,620
But when I see the communication is lacking,

1126
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,540
I just have to step away.

1127
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,880
I'm not there to correct that.

1128
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,240
People have to work that on their own.

1129
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,000
And I say, hey, if you if if

1130
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,800
you ever get a criticism that you're not

1131
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,240
a good communicator, just emulate someone who is.

1132
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,900
That's how physical therapy works.

1133
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,180
Right.

1134
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:10,640
Right.

1135
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,720
Or mental therapy.

1136
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,380
Just copy.

1137
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,000
Like if you know someone who is an

1138
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,160
artist, for example, they you know, they have

1139
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,260
like writer's block.

1140
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
Yeah, it's almost like the concept of act

1141
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,000
as if.

1142
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,340
Right.

1143
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,060
I think, yeah, I've known some artists, professional

1144
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,820
artists, portrait painters and stuff.

1145
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,100
And when they go through like a block,

1146
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,720
a creative block, they get these big coffee

1147
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,360
table books.

1148
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,980
They pay like 200 bucks from these large

1149
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,520
Picasso books or Rembrandt.

1150
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,000
And they start just copying that painting to

1151
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,680
see how well they can copy it, to

1152
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,480
go through that other person's motions.

1153
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,360
Right.

1154
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,200
And then that breaks them out of their

1155
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,580
funk.

1156
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,680
Right.

1157
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,020
So I've told people, if you have a

1158
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,720
problem, hey, listen, I may not be the

1159
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,840
best to ever just just, you know, emulate

1160
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,820
the way I speak.

1161
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,600
Well, a lot of musicians, when they get

1162
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,800
down creatively, kind of what do they do?

1163
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,340
They get together with a couple of friends

1164
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,220
and they start playing the songs that they

1165
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,940
enjoyed to try to emulate the creations that

1166
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,900
they were inspired to do their own.

1167
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,020
Enjoying, I'm saying is just do a cover.

1168
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,600
Do somebody plays with somebody else's play?

1169
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,520
What I'm saying is the thing that inspired

1170
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,640
them to be a musician.

1171
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,740
Now they go through the motions of doing

1172
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,020
it.

1173
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,220
And it's sort of a way of accomplishing

1174
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,240
the same goal, right?

1175
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,800
Yeah, sort of.

1176
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,220
It's just a matter of the thing is

1177
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,660
to still have a discipline, even though it's

1178
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,600
not your personal way, but you go through

1179
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
the motions just like a physical therapy.

1180
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,320
If someone has trouble walking, there is a

1181
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,540
standard way of walking.

1182
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,300
Everyone has a different gate and a different

1183
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,160
step and all that.

1184
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,200
But if there's a standard way, go ahead

1185
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,940
and do that just to get yourself moving

1186
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,560
and then go ahead and freestyle.

1187
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,900
It's called freestyling, right?

1188
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,000
Everybody's freestyling.

1189
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,300
So, yeah, it's fine.

1190
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,100
But everyone has their own pace at learning

1191
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,520
and being proactive.

1192
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,120
But I need it like front loaded and

1193
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,560
fast.

1194
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,060
This is kind of like we're going to

1195
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,080
war in 30 days.

1196
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,620
This is not a 90 day boot camp.

1197
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,960
It's a 30 day boot camp, you know,

1198
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,460
kind of thing.

1199
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,260
So I would hate to have to do

1200
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,300
what I'm doing and the financial stuff and

1201
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,200
the administrative stuff.

1202
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,560
Oh, my gosh, that would be that would

1203
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,960
really like stuff that I would say I

1204
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,340
get done in six months now will take

1205
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,360
me a year or two years.

1206
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,940
So it kills, by the way, doing the

1207
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,700
financially administrative stuff, the stuff the bankers like

1208
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,380
to do, you know, being like that, because

1209
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,640
you have to be just like them for

1210
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,540
them to, you know, to work with them

1211
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,120
destroys creativity for me.

1212
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,640
I can't go back from in the middle

1213
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,620
of doing some R&D or developing something.

1214
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,540
And I spend an hour doing bulls of

1215
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,240
exchange or studying something that I want to

1216
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,700
get into.

1217
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,200
I go back to what I was working

1218
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,380
on.

1219
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,100
And it's like, what the hell am I

1220
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,340
doing?

1221
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,480
I forgot or this doesn't you know, even

1222
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,020
if I took notes, I can't go.

1223
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
So I know I have to separate that.

1224
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:51,740
Right.

1225
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,500
And that's why I'm doing it.

1226
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,800
I just want to find people.
