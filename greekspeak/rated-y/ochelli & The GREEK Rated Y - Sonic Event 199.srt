1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,760
Okay, Sonic Event 199, Rated Y, here we

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,080
are.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,040
Greek, a little confusion because we did lose

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
Skype, RIP Skype, the other day, but anyway,

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,240
how are you doing?

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,440
Yeah, I'm all right.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,220
I'm on the laptop, the old setup.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,140
It's fine.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,640
I think we're going to go to Jitsi,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,100
practice that, I have to get another phone

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,080
because it doesn't support this or that.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,740
It's crazy.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,060
I just want to mention it's crazy.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,580
Today I got confirmation I could draw funds

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,300
on the lab and all that, and as

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,920
soon as I got that message, the washing

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,420
machine breaks, the car computer burned out, yeah,

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,400
this happens all the time.

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,080
I think I went over this, the frustration

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,540
when I was building the Scalarator.

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,600
By the way, it's the one year anniversary

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,660
for the Scalarator.

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,680
Where are the chances of getting funding for

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,960
a lab for the Scalarator exactly, I'm sorry,

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,100
and the two year anniversary exactly on the

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,840
day, right?

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,100
Even so, getting funding for something like that

28
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,879
within two years is one of those wet

29
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,320
dreams usually for somebody.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,880
It is.

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,300
It is.

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah, and that's just because it works really

33
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,360
well.

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,740
The Scalarator is a wet dream, by the

35
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,720
way, in its own right.

36
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,300
There you go.

37
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,280
Well, that was the double entendre there.

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,160
Yeah, that's right.

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
Anyway, let's get into questions, but everything, yeah,

40
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,620
it's like someone who was running this whatever,

41
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,360
is always like kind of, and I sound

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,200
like whatever, they're putting the thumb on me.

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,360
It's like, nah, we don't want you moving

44
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,380
too fast, so we're going to burn out

45
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,620
your car computer and break your washing machine

46
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,280
while you're doing a load, and we're going

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,000
to prevent you from getting on the audio

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
because you have a DAC, a high end

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,720
DAC plugged in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm like, you know, screw you.

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
Well, it wouldn't be memorable unless they were

52
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,700
screwing with you a little bit, and you

53
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,220
know, the funny thing is I tested this

54
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,700
with three different people yesterday, Jitsi, just to

55
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,240
make sure that it was an easy connect

56
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,320
audio wise, so I connected with three different

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,980
people that are just, you know, subscribers, and

58
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,220
I ended up talking to them, and it

59
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,860
was very easy.

60
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,520
It was very simple.

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,340
They were on video.

62
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,420
I didn't even need the video.

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,520
We're talking this and that, and they wind

64
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,680
up talking to me quite a while, and

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
I'm like, oh, this is no problem.

66
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,000
All I got to do is send a

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,620
link to the Greek and done, and it

68
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,280
was my fault.

69
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,540
Yeah, I had a homemade DAC plugged in

70
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,200
that takes control of the sound card, so

71
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
no matter what adjustments you make in the

72
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,400
settings, it doesn't override it until you unplug

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,820
the damn thing, and I had to do

74
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,880
one of those Terminator scans on it, like,

75
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,180
what the hell is preventing this?

76
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
It's got to be that, and yeah, okay,

77
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,100
so let's get into some questions.

78
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,900
Yeah, meanwhile, on my end, I'm just saying,

79
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,500
I was sitting here trying to scan everything

80
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,620
and going, what the hell did I do

81
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,540
wrong, and I couldn't find anything, and I'm

82
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:37,700
going.

83
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,540
Yeah, because it's always your fault anyway, right?

84
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,940
Well, I assume that, to be honest with

85
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,740
you, not just with you.

86
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,140
I just always assume it's my fault.

87
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,500
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

88
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,460
Let's not get into that.

89
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,400
Who cares what I think?

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Here we go.

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,820
Can Greek comment on if antagonist relationships in

92
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,200
the realm of nine-star key work, okay,

93
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,020
this I didn't quite understand, but I guess,

94
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,040
can you comment on antagonist relationships in the

95
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,760
realm of nine-star key work, which is

96
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,500
a reference to an earlier Sonic where you

97
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,000
talked about that.

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

99
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
I've been in them, and it feeds, what

100
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,400
it does, antagonism would be like metal and

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
earth because metal cuts earth, right, so, or

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,900
wood and fire, right, imagine wood and fire,

103
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,260
right?

104
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,520
So who's the winner in that one?

105
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Guess.

106
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,380
The fire.

107
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,760
Fire consumes wood.

108
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,760
So, you know, the metal consumes the soil,

109
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
the fire consumes, so that's how that would

110
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,120
go.

111
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,700
Well, unless you have ridiculous proportions, obviously, if

112
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,040
you dump, you know, eight million pounds of

113
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,780
wood on top of a campfire, yeah, you

114
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,400
know, fire loses it.

115
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,460
Because they're in a relationship one-on-one,

116
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,260
it would be a parity on the allotted,

117
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,520
you know, amount, right, it would be how

118
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
much one can do, so, and of course,

119
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,540
if your water and someone else's soil, you're

120
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,120
going to make mud, right, and now it's

121
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,380
not always like that because I'm giving the

122
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,160
Western perspective on these things, you know, like,

123
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,100
for example, when we want to show something

124
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,980
alarming, we use red in the West, and

125
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,840
something sickly, we use green, you know, in,

126
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,339
or whatever, it's the opposite in the East,

127
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,880
right, like red is good luck, or here,

128
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,779
it's warning, right?

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,920
Yeah, let me add a question from a

130
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,040
different listener, which followed up to the original

131
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,620
question, which will fit with what you're talking

132
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,840
about right now, can Greek also explain why

133
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,200
nine-star key astrology would be a better

134
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,840
system for looking into someone's life than Western

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,480
astrology, Vedic astrology, and other systems?

136
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,160
Sure, sure, it would be like asking Spock

137
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,660
that question, not because I'm Spock, but asking

138
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,460
a Vulcan that question, because nine-star key

139
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,620
did not come about through just like geomancy

140
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,440
and, you know, reading tea leaves, for about

141
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,800
two or three thousand years, there were people

142
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,680
by imperial order assigned multi-generation to go

143
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,960
and scour the cities and the countryside and

144
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,360
keep records and statistics, and at the end

145
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,020
of the year, like a census, they would

146
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,580
compile all this information they gathered when people

147
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,920
were born, when they were born and all

148
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,340
that, and see what the tendencies were, these

149
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,140
are not presumed, this is all gathered like

150
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,240
statistical data, believe it or not, it's not

151
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,260
like reading tea leaves and someone said some

152
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,900
psychic, well this is it, you know, no,

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,480
no, this stuff is based on what you

154
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,560
would call science today, what science should be,

155
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,900
gathering information, collating it, making a report.

156
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,760
Well, because logic is a much more sensible

157
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,700
system is how Spock would respond, yeah, okay.

158
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,760
It's not presumptive, in other words, it's by

159
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,860
using averages, you know, people that have a

160
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,100
mole on their left cheek, what is their

161
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,080
life like, when were they born, you know,

162
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,300
like people who have a mole on their

163
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,580
left cheek, they can't be very difficult to

164
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,300
manage other people, they're usually introverted, they might

165
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,760
be good artists, you know, but if you

166
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,460
make them like a manager of a Starbucks,

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,220
the business will go down, it's just a

168
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,420
damn mole on your cheek, right, stuff like

169
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,800
that, that they looked at, and because the

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
nine star key stuff that we get, like

171
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,540
in these little, someone very graciously sent me

172
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,020
a little paperback book, and I'm very gracious

173
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,720
by looking through it, but I'm like, oh,

174
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,120
this is just like a basic of the

175
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,780
basic, imagine the cliff notes of the cliff

176
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,960
notes, right, like if you had a book

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,780
that was 2,000 pages thick, can you

178
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,820
make a 15 or 80 page cliff notes,

179
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,000
it wouldn't do it justice, right, you would

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,580
need at least a 400 page book to

181
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,600
tell you what's going on in a very

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,040
information jam-packed 2,000 page book, so,

183
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,900
but with nine star key, we get the

184
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,920
most basic of the most basic, but it

185
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,980
doesn't mean we're lost, we have an outline,

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,660
and then you can keep digging and researching

187
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,860
further, unfortunately we don't have good libraries to

188
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,980
go to anymore that house this information, and

189
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,260
the internet's becoming a wasteland, so all I

190
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,720
can say is do the best you can,

191
00:06:59,820 --> 00:06:59,960
right?

192
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,860
I'm actually going to make a bit of

193
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,680
a trip to the local library soon here

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,200
in Macon, Georgia, I want to see what

195
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,440
condition it's in, and see what they're doing

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
there, because I've heard stories, so I want

197
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,680
to go check it out for myself, and

198
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
see, because I haven't been to a library

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
in many years, ever since I moved from

200
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,740
the northeast, anyway, I was just letting you

201
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,220
know that, so I'll report on that when

202
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,460
I come back, and maybe we'll have more

203
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,580
to discuss, so here's Let me tell you,

204
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
I spent a lot of time at the

205
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,780
main library in New York, and the one

206
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,680
that was built in 1902 on 42nd and

207
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,400
5th, which is a great place, even for

208
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
architectural students, even if you're not going to

209
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,300
read a book, just go look at the

210
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,640
architecture, but where I sat, I was like,

211
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
I used to tell guys, you know, you

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
want to go meet girls at bars, man,

213
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,500
go to the library, they have the cutest

214
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,540
librarians, but anyway, I was 20 years old,

215
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,640
21, 22, so about 27, but not all

216
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
of them, you know, some of them forget

217
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
to shave, but anyway, what I mean is,

218
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,700
when I got used to that experience, and

219
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,180
there's a big major library in Brooklyn, which

220
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,280
is also very good, not as good, it's

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,140
right there at the Grand Army Plaza area,

222
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,940
Park Slope, the major one there, which is

223
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,180
very, they have an excellent Egyptian display, all

224
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,420
this other stuff, and that was, they have

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,240
the books that no one wants, you know,

226
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,680
and one of the books I took out

227
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,860
once from the Brooklyn one was the Ten

228
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,080
Worst Popes of All Time, that's when I

229
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,360
started really realizing how everything is backwards, but

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,200
what I want to say is, when I

231
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,100
came to Tucson in 98, I said, like

232
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,220
you said, let me go check out the

233
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,100
library here, right?

234
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,720
So I walked through, it was like, nobody

235
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,260
there, and I was looking at what they

236
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,740
had, and it's basically like school textbooks, right?

237
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,179
And I'll tell you in a minute what

238
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:41,780
I think of that.

239
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,960
And suddenly a librarian comes out and says,

240
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
oh yeah, I told her, you know, I'm

241
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,240
from New York, moved to Tucson, and I

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,620
was, she goes, oh, okay, everything on this

243
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,940
side is fiction, everything here is non-fiction.

244
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,920
I looked at her, I said, darling, based

245
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,900
on what I've seen so far, everything you

246
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,780
have is fiction, you know, because remember, because

247
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,040
the books that they were showing and the

248
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,280
non-fiction were like college textbooks, which are

249
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,160
fiction, right?

250
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Bullshit, right?

251
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,920
And I was like, darling, everything you have

252
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
is fiction, and I walked out, never been

253
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,140
back, there's no reason to.

254
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,160
You know, I can recognize a college textbook,

255
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,960
you know, from a mile away, I could

256
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,400
smell it, you know, it's all propaganda, right?

257
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,080
So anyway, that's what I think.

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,360
I hope you don't find that at MAKE,

259
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,660
and I hope you find some old stuff.

260
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,620
No, I hope so too, because that, the

261
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,760
chances are, you might, here in the South,

262
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
you know, it depends.

263
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,160
It could be high quality or low quality.

264
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,960
Very high, very good chances of finding it.

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,880
So anyway, another comment here is, the stuff

266
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,160
from Walter Russell I read was mind-blowing.

267
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,080
Funny how they describe him on the Wikipedia

268
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,440
page as an, quote, American artist.

269
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,620
It looks like very little credit was given

270
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,260
to him for his work as a scientist.

271
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,700
Well, because who gets more money?

272
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, remember years ago, people asked me about

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
CERN?

274
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,240
You know what CERN is?

275
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,080
It's like, remember that show Pimp My Ride?

276
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:02,720
Oh yeah.

277
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,380
Yeah, it's kind of, what do you remember

278
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,620
about, if you were to explain it in

279
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,660
less than 10 seconds, it's kind of gaudy

280
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,820
or bodacious, overdone.

281
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,680
You put crazy things in a car, where

282
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,660
they were putting televisions and fish tanks and

283
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,140
jacuzzis in a car.

284
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,340
Yeah.

285
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:17,960
Right.

286
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,700
So what CERN is telling you is, ha

287
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,500
ha, we have access to the credit system

288
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,800
and you don't, which is unlimited money, right?

289
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,340
That's all there, right?

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,460
So do the artists say that?

291
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,400
Do the artists say, ha ha, we have

292
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,480
unlimited access to the credit system?

293
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,780
No.

294
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,800
They keep them what?

295
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,580
What are they, what do, how are artists

296
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,080
described?

297
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,060
Starving artists.

298
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,140
There you go.

299
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,040
Right.

300
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,060
So, so when they put him in the

301
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,880
category as an artist, right away, you're like,

302
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,180
eh, I'm not impressed because what impresses people?

303
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,040
What was the whole purpose of Pimp My

304
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,380
Ride?

305
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,900
Oh yeah, just to show your wealth, to

306
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,540
be impressive.

307
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,000
Exactly.

308
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,820
You had the unique.

309
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah.

310
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
And what's the whole purpose of CERN?

311
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,320
Same thing.

312
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,300
I've told people over the years, and if

313
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
you ask me to prove it, I can,

314
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,920
but I won't.

315
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,440
Now I'm too much in another direction.

316
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
I can do what CERN is doing on

317
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,160
a desktop, like a benchtop, like in my

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,180
kitchen, you can do the same thing they're

319
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,460
doing.

320
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,900
You don't need that scale.

321
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,880
Right.

322
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,540
Um, very simple if you understand the principle

323
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,360
of what they're doing.

324
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,700
So, um, like for example, and I'll just

325
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,360
end it right here.

326
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,680
Everyone talks about the speed of light.

327
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,380
Okay.

328
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,080
But no one talks about the speed of

329
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,720
magnetism.

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,920
Don't touch it.

331
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
It's a hell of a lot faster than

332
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
the speed of light.

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,240
And what are they using to drive CERN?

334
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,320
Magnetism.

335
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,900
To do what?

336
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,200
Right.

337
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,760
You can figure out the rest of your,

338
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,740
you can do that irrespective of scale.

339
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,620
So anyway, just like Pimp My Ride, do

340
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,920
you really need your car to be done

341
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
by Pimp My Ride to have a good

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,900
car functioning?

343
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
No, not even.

344
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,420
Absolutely not.

345
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,700
Yeah.

346
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,940
So actually there was a YouTube channel that

347
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,780
would follow the Pimp My Ride cars years

348
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,040
later and like half of them are in

349
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,520
junkyards.

350
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,200
Literally.

351
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,820
Mostly.

352
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,340
Yeah.

353
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,580
Right.

354
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah.

355
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,900
You've seen that.

356
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,300
So, uh, yeah.

357
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,620
All right.

358
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,000
What else?

359
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,480
Okay.

360
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,320
So here's the last one.

361
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,520
Uh, does the Greek have thoughts on the

362
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,280
concept of controlling one's own environment by strategically

363
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,800
and intelligently selecting colors and color schemes on

364
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,460
walls, clothing, et cetera, to create circumstances and

365
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,560
encourage things to be much like they used

366
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
to do in institutions when they wanted to,

367
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,640
uh, impress upon the inmates, calm and stuff

368
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,220
like that.

369
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,420
Is there a way to sort of adapt

370
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,580
a color scheme or a color wheel to

371
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,340
create certain results automatically or to encourage them

372
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,180
in one's own environment?

373
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,440
That's the question.

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,300
Yeah.

375
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,660
I would research Abraham with an I, Kareem,

376
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,120
biogeometry, synesthesia, dowsing, radionics, uh, like back to

377
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
the prisoner thing.

378
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,440
I mean, you know that it's a fact,

379
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,800
uh, well, I haven't done it.

380
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,000
I haven't looked into it much, but I

381
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,420
keep, keeps popping up that if you surround

382
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,360
someone with the color pink, you typically, um,

383
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,040
they become 10 to 20, 20% weaker

384
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,760
muscularly if they're surrounded.

385
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
That's why one of the football teams, they

386
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,280
painted the visitors, a locker room pink.

387
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,520
They thought it was should be demoralizing.

388
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,460
It was more than that.

389
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,620
Now, what you learn from Abraham Kareem is

390
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,200
with biogeometry, there is each, a lot of

391
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,100
people mistake this with the feng shui or

392
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,620
what they call feng shui, uh, that the

393
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,500
wall should be different colors like black for

394
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,260
the North whatever for water and wealth and

395
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,580
red.

396
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,760
And, um, you don't have to do the

397
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,460
entire wall.

398
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,060
So if you determine through your own geomancy,

399
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,140
which is literally means the study of the

400
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,280
earth and that type of, let's say, we

401
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,420
might call in quotes, divination or dowsing.

402
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,040
If a room needs red, for example, you

403
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,020
can make a small two by two inch

404
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,220
square red square and put it underneath a

405
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,620
picture.

406
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,840
It doesn't have to be visible.

407
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,440
Just the presence of that red in that

408
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,860
direction is fine.

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,100
Just to give you an example, the same

410
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,820
thing works.

411
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,100
This is like not a segue, but it's

412
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,840
the same subject.

413
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,140
Smart meters affect some people, right?

414
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,780
Like they get this acute tinnitus.

415
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,880
Some people get nauseous.

416
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,160
Some people come down with physical.

417
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,500
It's not everyone right now, just like for

418
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,060
example, cell phones seem to be harmless.

419
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,440
But once I was on a cell phone

420
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,140
for nine hours and I did get the

421
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,500
side of my head did feel like it

422
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,020
was cooked.

423
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,580
Yeah.

424
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,000
Right.

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,380
So what I tell people for smart meters

426
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,020
is if it's on the wall of the

427
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,880
house, which it usually is, what you do

428
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
is you put a mirror behind between you

429
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
and the as close as possible to the

430
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,160
smart meter.

431
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,460
So if the smart meter, let's say, is

432
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,340
on the wall of the back room of

433
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,320
your house and you find out where that

434
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,160
is on the inside, you just put a

435
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,980
mirror up on that area where the smart

436
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
meter is.

437
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,540
But the mirror is facing the smart mirror,

438
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,320
the smart meter, not the inside.

439
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,720
So inside the room, all you see is

440
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,620
the back of the mirror.

441
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,100
Ugly.

442
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,420
Right.

443
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,440
So you just cover that with another picture.

444
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,040
Right.

445
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,940
You know, years ago, that works reflecting the

446
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,720
energy back out.

447
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,060
Right.

448
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,860
Years ago, you brought this up on an

449
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,600
on a Sonic and Ocelli in the Greek,

450
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,580
and I passed that along to a handful

451
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,620
of people and they reported back to me

452
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,640
that it worked actually.

453
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah, they felt the difference.

454
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,440
Yeah.

455
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah.

456
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,240
They felt the difference like immediately within a

457
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
day, the problems they were having sort of

458
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
started to go away and they play strategically

459
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,540
placed mirrors for a couple of different reasons

460
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,880
facing outward.

461
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,940
Like basically it's up against the wall.

462
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,280
And like you said, just put a picture

463
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,040
on the back of the mirror and boom.

464
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,240
Now it's a decoration and it serves a

465
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,520
purpose.

466
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,580
It's it's hidden.

467
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:44,880
Yeah.

468
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,200
And it's hidden or buried.

469
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,280
If a new new construction, put it in

470
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,960
the wall.

471
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,500
If it's a new if you know the

472
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,440
meter is going there, I mean, new construction,

473
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,260
it's framed out.

474
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,640
Right.

475
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,720
Go ahead and put it inside the wall.

476
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,680
Yeah.

477
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,840
But that would be that would be the

478
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,500
most hidden way nobody would ever see the

479
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,720
thing.

480
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,060
Exactly.

481
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,000
Or if it's mounted like we have a

482
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,020
gas meter like that and it comes out

483
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,860
of the ground, it's two inches from the

484
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,420
wall because it's connected to the ground.

485
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,520
You just go outside and put the mirror

486
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,000
between the outside of the house and the

487
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,220
meter.

488
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,720
I actually have a bunch of old mirrors.

489
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,500
I used to save them.

490
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
You know, when my wife first met me,

491
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,240
I was living alone and she thought I

492
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,760
was narcissistic or whatever, because all the mirrors

493
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,120
I had and I said, those mirrors are

494
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,000
strategically placed, one opposite the front door, one

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,680
here, one there.

496
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,740
You know, she's like, oh, really?

497
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,120
You know, I thought you just like looking

498
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,800
at yourself.

499
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm like, yeah, that that's another story, though.

500
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,680
But no, the mirrors are there strategically, you

501
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,020
know, again, like the nine star key and

502
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,460
the colors in the room change energy.

503
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,220
The simplest way is, you know, the the

504
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,420
idea in Feng Shui or Feng Shui in

505
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,600
Chinese, which means water, wind or water, earth,

506
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,520
water, wind, typically a mirror of any size.

507
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,000
It could be a mirror, an eighth inch

508
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,020
in diameter, which wouldn't be qualified as a

509
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,520
mirror because some of these office pens have

510
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,580
a shiny tip, right?

511
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,200
That is an eighth of an inch in

512
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,180
diameter, right?

513
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,520
Just opposite the entrance door.

514
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,900
What the story behind that, that they told

515
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,540
the base people back then is that if

516
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,420
a demon wants to come into your abode,

517
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,819
the purpose of the mirror is the demon

518
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,819
is so ugly, he'll see the mirror, get

519
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,260
scared, right?

520
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,440
And then run out again.

521
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,099
That's what they told the simple people, right?

522
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,260
He'll be scared of his own image.

523
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,620
So that's how I tell people, you know,

524
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
basically, but it has a lot to do.

525
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,680
Remember, I said the gods are humans or

526
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
humans, people or like people, but they just

527
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,980
have higher tech.

528
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,940
They get away with saying they're gods because

529
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,720
whatever, right, you know, so the tech of

530
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,280
the mirror, like what we consider harmful from

531
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,320
smart meters, has always been around and always

532
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,780
used for people or against people or certain

533
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,220
groups against other groups or for benefit of

534
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,300
some, all this technology we have has always

535
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,000
been around.

536
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,320
And I've told people in the past, you

537
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,100
can't show me any time in history, if

538
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,380
you really study any society that did not

539
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,680
know about electricity, everybody knew about it.

540
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
It was just not used.

541
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,180
Like, for example, I don't want to get

542
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,100
into a whole thing here.

543
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,020
But cell phones, cell phones were invented in

544
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,040
the 1930s.

545
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,880
And anyone with a truck that ran along

546
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,620
highways that had the lines had what looked

547
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,640
like a regular phone receiver in a box.

548
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
And they were trucking and they would pick

549
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,240
up the phone.

550
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
And as long as they're on that highway,

551
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,880
there were telephone radio lines along the highway

552
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,460
and they can make a phone call to

553
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,280
their dispatcher.

554
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,920
Where do you want me?

555
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,680
This is where I am.

556
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,240
This is where the package is good.

557
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,660
It was very common.

558
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,000
And actually, there are YouTube videos, cell phones

559
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,160
in the 1940s, films in the 1930s and

560
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,500
40s.

561
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,140
About that you see a trucker on the

562
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,020
phone, but it looks just like the hand

563
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,580
receiver that you and I grew up with,

564
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:46,760
right?

565
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,460
Landline, right?

566
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,080
Yeah.

567
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,940
And then what happened in the 70s that

568
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,040
they had too much control over the truckers.

569
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,080
They said, screw this stuff.

570
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,660
Let's get CB radios.

571
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,280
We're independent.

572
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,020
Now we can communicate wherever we go.

573
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,440
Remember the CB craze in the 70s, right?

574
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,140
They even did a movie called Convoy or

575
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,040
whatever based on it.

576
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,380
It was about the CB radio was a

577
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,540
representation or an expression of a form of

578
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,100
rebellion.

579
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,440
The Citizen's Band, which some people got bases

580
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,280
and they could communicate with people over long

581
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,780
distances.

582
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,980
There was all kinds of stuff going on.

583
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,900
But what happened in the 70s, you see,

584
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,060
it was a rebellion.

585
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
If you look at the films that were

586
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,420
done around it, it was like they were

587
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,840
rebels.

588
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,800
Why?

589
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,380
Because then they can get off the main

590
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,100
cell lines.

591
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,880
I told this to people years ago.

592
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,440
I had a client.

593
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,820
They had these twins and they said, these

594
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,600
twins are special.

595
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,360
They're really smart.

596
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,680
They were raised by nannies and all that.

597
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,800
And I asked them, OK, if they're so

598
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,420
smart, they're like five years old boy and

599
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,700
girl fraternal.

600
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,860
I said, they're always watching TV.

601
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,140
And the parents said, we don't want your

602
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,880
services anymore because I told them, don't let

603
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,020
the TV raise your children.

604
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,400
Right.

605
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
They didn't like that.

606
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:52,980
Right.

607
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
But someone's got to tell them.

608
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,260
Right.

609
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,180
Well, I asked the little children, do you

610
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,300
know when you're considered geniuses?

611
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,480
Yeah, we're considered geniuses.

612
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,400
I said, when was it?

613
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,860
How long has the TV been around?

614
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,080
It's always been around.

615
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,360
Right.

616
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,280
They didn't know the TV was invented.

617
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,260
The electric TV was invented by Farnsworth in

618
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,820
the 30s.

619
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,540
They didn't know that.

620
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,440
They thought it went back to the dinosaurs.

621
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Yeah, of course.

622
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah.

623
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,780
Because they don't know the history of it.

624
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,560
Much like these young people now think that

625
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
there was always cameras everywhere you went.

626
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
So, you know, because that's the way it's

627
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,960
always been.

628
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,420
Yeah.

629
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah.

630
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,180
It's funny when you see there's actually videos

631
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,580
I noticed even not recently, but even 10

632
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,540
years ago, some young people, they gave them

633
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,460
a regular rotary phone.

634
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,460
They picked up the receiver part, but they

635
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,480
were like, what do we do now?

636
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,360
You know, you remember the rotary dial, right?

637
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,740
I was like, man, that's worse than watching

638
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,140
a monkey trying to fuck a football.

639
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,560
But anyway, yeah, true enough.

640
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,760
Okay, well, look, fair enough.

641
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
I think this is all very interesting.

642
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,720
Is there anything else that you want to

643
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,340
add for today or, you know, a bunch

644
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,700
of stuff, but I think we're going to

645
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,960
make this one super short.

646
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,260
We'll make it up on the next one.

647
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,860
How's that?

648
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Look, that sounds good.

649
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,080
I want to let you know, that whole

650
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
color thing, though, was inspired by an earlier

651
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,080
sonic where you mentioned the color blue for

652
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,120
repelling bugs in the yard.

653
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh, yeah.

654
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,020
That was from a year.

655
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,540
That works.

656
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,020
That works.

657
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,920
Just blue, any blue around light bulbs and

658
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,000
the bugs go away because it's the yin

659
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,720
yang principle.

660
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,420
You can apply universal principle.

661
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,180
You can apply principles that are like, how

662
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,820
would you call it when something's already thought

663
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,600
out for you?

664
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
It's like eating out of a can, right?

665
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,960
Microwave dinner, you know, there's a lot of

666
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,180
pre-packaged stuff.

667
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,540
Yeah.

668
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
Do this and do this and you get

669
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:31,820
that.

670
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,180
That's fine.

671
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,920
But I like using universal principles.

672
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,100
By the way, I've gotten a lot of

673
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,700
feedback you know, bugs around the light.

674
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,820
What do you have a light at night

675
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,340
outside the house, usually by the door?

676
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,160
And all the bugs are there.

677
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,320
What happens when you open the door?

678
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,560
All the bugs come in, yeah.

679
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,520
Well, if you put some blue tape or

680
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,140
some blue color, electric blue works best, like

681
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,160
the most vibrant blue you can get, cobalt

682
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,080
blue, they stay away.

683
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,460
Most of them do.

684
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,300
And I've gotten a lot of feedback on

685
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,600
that.

686
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
And it works.

687
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,680
That's based on universal principle, yin and yang.
